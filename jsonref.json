Now, it is associated instead with ‘The Duchess of Givenchy’.

Even the Arnault family, which owns the brand, were kept in the dark.Birmingham-born Keller, 48, who studied at the Royal College of Art before working for Calvin Klein in New York, became the creative head of the fashion house in May last year and had been burying herself in the brand’s archives when she received a phone call.It was November 2017, immediately after Prince Harry and Meghan’s engagement. The request came completely out of the blue: the Royal bride-to-be wanted Keller to design her wedding dress.‘I think she had seen my work and knew what I did,’ the designer said after the wedding.           Arriving in Ireland in July, Meghan wore the first of four jaw-droppingly expensive outfits for her Irish tour.

Both have a similar sense of style and a collection of Manolo Blahnik shoes.Meghan has the designer’s BB pumps in five colours and Clare has a lizard pair she loves. Their joint interests extend to the great outdoors and their much-adored pets.

Meghan’s vision, which was elegant, classical and timeless, was true Givenchy. All ‘seven or eight’ fittings with the bride were done personally, in secret, in LondonThere, she worked alongside another of Meghan’s muses – Carolyn Bessette, who married John F. Kennedy Jr.Four years later, the ambitious designer was off to Ralph Lauren for the launch of his bespoke men’s Purple Label collection.Then, in 2000, at the age of 29, she returned to London to work for Gucci’s Tom Ford.Her big breakthrough came when she turned around the fortunes of Scottish knitwear brand Pringle. Her work there won her the coveted Designer of the Year trophy at the Scottish Fashion Awards.But it was only in 2011, when she took over as creative designer at Chloé, that she began to achieve public acclaim. She is rumoured to have left because the label wouldn’t give her ‘salary increases proportionate to sales’ but was keen, too, to return to Britain for her twin girls’ education.These days, she spends half the week in the family home in World’s End, Chelsea, the rest in Parisian hotels for Givenchy. She has immersed herself in the brand and befriended its founder, the late Count Hubert de Givenchy, who told her that Givenchy was ‘all about the shoulders, darling’.Sadly, he died in March, two months before Meghan walked down the aisle in a dress which showed to the world that it was indeed all about the shoulders. Talking about being the first female designer at Givenchy, Keller said recently: ‘I can understand why people touch on it, because of course whenever women get into higher positions it’s always something to be applauded.‘But I don’t think we should anchor everything on that, because it’s so important to actually think of women as strong creatives: people who can bring and contribute something, rather than just purely for the fact that they’re female.‘It’s through the work that I do that I’m able to push up higher and be so successful.’A mantra, it seems, which is not so different from that of the Duchess of Sussex herself."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/16/08/005A9D2700000258-6500771-Bobby_Robson_the_previous_England_manager_to_take_his_side_to_a_-m-4_1544949057922.jpg","title":"England football boss Gareth Southgate line OBE","story":"    Gareth Southgate, pictured celebrating England\u0027s victory over Sweden in the World Cup quarter-final in Russia that took them into the last four, will reportedly receive an honour A source told the newspaper: \u0027Gareth is definitely up for an honour, most likely an OBE or CBE, as it is perhaps too early for a knighthood.\u0027He is on the list, very few people know about it yet.\u0027Southgate is odds-on at 1-4 with bookmaker Coral to receive an OBE, as the firm\u0027s John Hill said the manager had \u0027helped the nation fall back in love with the country’s football team again\u0027. The two previous England managers to have led their side to a World Cup semi-final also received honours and knighthoods. Alf Ramsey, who guided England to World Cup glory on home soil in 1966, was knighted a year later. Two of the triumphant 1966 squad -

Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be. Would exit have to be delayed from March 29? Yes. On the shortest timescale imaginable, a referendum would take almost six months from the point the decision was taken - something which has not happened yet.

The Populus poll put Labour on 40 per cent, the Conservatives on 37 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on seven per cent. The pivot towards a possible second referendum will enrage the pro-Brexit backbenchers who led last week\u0027s failed attempt to topple Mrs May.    Mrs May had to endure a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the Tory party on Wednesday. She nwon by 200 votes to 117The Prime Minister was forced to pull the meaningful Commons vote on her Brexit deal after party whips told her she was likely to lose by a large margin, prompting backbenchers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s hard-Brexit European Research Group (ERG), to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership of the Tory party. Mrs May won by 200 votes to 117.The Prime Minister subsequently failed to persuade the EU to offer a compromise on the notorious Northern Ireland \u0027backstop\u0027, leaving aides to conclude that she is unlikely to win the Commons round to her deal. That leaves just three realistic options: a softer Norway-style Brexit, a No Deal exit or a second referendum.With large sections of the Tory party adamantly opposed to Norway, and a majority of MPs set against No Deal, The Mail on Sunday understands that Mr Barwell is considering the second public poll.Sources say that Mr Barwell has told the pro-Remain \u0027gang of five\u0027 Cabinet Ministers – Mr Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clarke –that a second vote is \u0027the only way out of this\u0027.But the idea is being fiercely opposed by pro-Brexit Cabinet ministers led by Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom and International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who argue that it would be greeted with fury – and possibly civil disorder – by people who had voted for Brexit two years ago. And it puts Mr Barwell at loggerheads with the Prime Minister, who told this newspaper last week that the 2016 referendum was the only \u0027people\u0027s vote\u0027 required.    The husband of Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, Philip, stands with Number 10 Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell, as Mrs May speaks outside 10 Downing Street after a confidence vote by Conservative Party Members of Parliament on Wednesday    Three options: How a second referendum paper might lookHowever a three-way question would not produce a conclusive result and would probably fall foul of electoral law. Therefore there could even be multiple rounds of voting, like a French presidential, election that would see No Deal go head-to-head with Remain in round two, if Mrs May\u0027s deal was rejected in a first vote.Ministers are ided over whether Brexit could be delayed or stopped without new legislation. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox told Cabinet a new Act would have to be passed, but secret Government legal advice says Mrs May could unilaterally halt our exit using Royal Prerogative.          How the 2016 ballot looked for the EU referendumCabinet Office Minister Mr Lidington has led the secret efforts to drum up support for a second poll by meeting senior Labour figures such as former Europe Minister Chris Bryant. Other \u0027back channels\u0027 have been established between Tory former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and between Tory Anna Soubry and Labour leadership hopeful Chuka Ummuna.But the discussions have revealed bitter differences over the wording of any referendum question, with No 10 indicating that it should be between Mrs May\u0027s deal or No Deal. Labour MPs have made clear that the price of their support would be including Remain as an option.Downing Street has been warned that some members of the ERG would be prepared to vote with Jeremy Corbyn in a Commons confidence motion, or abstain, rather than allow a second referendum.Last night, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith described Mr Lidington\u0027s manoeuvring as \u0027utter madness\u0027.He told The Mail on Sunday: \u0027I don\u0027t believe he has ever accepted we will leave. Doing deals with a Labour Party run by Jeremy Corbyn is literally madness, utter madness. All the polling says if there is a second referendum we will plunge at the next Election. We will not be re-elected if we do not deliver Brexit.\u0027Mr Duncan Smith said Mr Lidington\u0027s actions encouraged the EU to play hardball in negotiations in the expectation that MPs would call a second referendum rather than risk No Deal.\u0027They are making it very hard for the PM to negotiate,\u0027 he said. \u0027The EU just don\u0027t believe we are willing to walk away.\u0027Meanwhile, Brexit supporting Cabinet Ministers such as Ms Leadsom and Ms Mordaunt are pushing for a \u0027managed No Deal\u0027 option. It would involve the UK paying up to £20 billion for a \u0027standstill\u0027 two years in which Britain would mirror all EU rules to allow both sides to prepare for a hard exit.Mrs May\u0027s allies accuse Mr Rees-Mogg\u0027s ERG of making a second referendum more likely by sabotaging the Withdrawal Agreement.One Brexiteer Minister described the anger in Government over the abortive coup: \u0027They like to present them as Jesuitical true believers, but they are more like jihadists\u0027.The Populus poll, carried out for Best for Britain, a pro referendum group, found that while 74 per cent of Labour voters support a second referendum, a majority of Tory voters, 51 per cent, are against.    Although the sound was switched off, TV cameras caught Mrs May and Mr Juncker exchanging what looked to be heated words on Friday for at least a minuteHis comments sparked uproar among MPs and were in direct contrast to the agreed \u0027script\u0027 to help Mrs May sell the Withdrawal Agreement to the Commons. No 10 believe that meant they \u0027lost control of the narrative\u0027, turning MPs against the deal. Aides have told Paris of their outrage.May and Macron had a frosty private meeting on Friday morning in Brussels, just before a visibly furious Mrs May confronted Mr Juncker.Relations with Mr Varadkar are also cold, with sources claiming Mrs May \u0027loathes\u0027 the Irish Taoiseach.

The future King Edward VIII implored the British public to buy more goods and food produced at home in order to boost the economy through launching his campaign  The posters were created to get Brits to help boost the economy after it took a major hit in the Great Depression and encouraged the public to support British goodsAnother poster had echoes of Lord Kitchener\u0027s famous First World War recruitment poster with a man pointing a finger at the reader.There was also one poster depicting a young brother and sister at a shop counter asking the cashier \u0027I want the kind my Daddy makes\u0027.And another poster, which showed a rugby match, pleaded \u0027buy British and pass your wages to another member of the British team\u0027.          A copy of the Prince of Wales\u0027 broadcast message reads: \u0027It is now recognised that as a nation we have been lately buying from abroad more than we are able to pay for by our exports\u0027Patrick Bogue, owner of Onslows Auctions, said: \u0027The posters were issued to urge British people to buy goods made in the country instead of from abroad at a time of economic depression.\u0027They are numbered one to 26 and were issued every week to be displayed at factories.\u0027The message is very similar to what is going on in this country at the moment with Brexit.\u0027They belonged to a factory owner in the 1930s and were inherited by his grandson, who had them stored away but rediscovered them when moving house.\u0027I believe these posters were only issued in factories and they were likely destroyed after use so to find surviving copies is in fact quite rare.\u0027We\u0027re delighted with the sale result.\u0027At the time the posters were produced, Britain was in the clutches of an economic depression which originated from the US Great Depression of 1929.Unemployment had reached 70 per cent in some areas, with the industrial and mining areas of the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales particularly hard-hit.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Seven acres woodland permission build luxury treehouse goes sale 1m","story":"    Once completed the treehouse-inspired home would be worth up to £2.75m and offer a lifestyle property with cutting edge modern designA whole lot of bling!

The Government could call such a vote at any time. Labour also has some opportunities to call a vote - though winning such a vote would have less power.It could even be a whole general election where one or more sides puts a new referendum in their manifesto. What would the question and be who decides? Nobody knows for sure - and this is probably the hardest question of all.Some say it should be a simple repeat of last time, with Leave or Remain on the ballot paper. Others say it should be Remain versus Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.Others advocate a two stage referendum - between Remain and Leave, followed by Mrs May\u0027s deal versus No Deal if Leave wins. Still others say there could be multiple questions on the ballot paper, possible using a ranking system known as alternative vote.The Electoral Commission would make a recommendation and MPs would make the final decision on what the question would be. Would exit have to be delayed from March 29? Yes. On the shortest timescale imaginable, a referendum would take almost six months from the point the decision was taken - something which has not happened yet. Exit day is less than four months away."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands march Brussels against U N migration pact","story":"    A protester throws a missile at the police during an anti-migrant demonstration outside of EU headquarters in Brussels          A Flemish nationalist attends a protest against Marrakesh Migration Pact in Brussels.

But I don’t care if I just find a nail. It’s still such a thrill!’Of course, every so often there’s the occasional find — a crotal bell which once hung round the neck of an animal with a rattling metal pea inside an old locket with an intricate design and a selection of Roman coins — ‘2,000 years old, at least’.‘Just think, all the time that stuff’s been in the ground!’ says Len, aglow as he cradles what look suspiciously like a pendant circa 1970 in his giant paws.But finally, his luck changed. He came across a 2,000-year-old Roman figure sitting in a large Flora margarine tub.‘The minute I saw it, I just had a feeling,’ he says. ‘The colour, the weight. I thought it was important and very, very old.’ Although, technically, he did not actually detect it.It all started last December when Len was hunting a new stretch of fields near his home. He was chatting to the landowner who then showed him a small broken statuette, found on the land 15 years earlier by a fellow detectorist, dismissed as a copy, dumped in the Flora tub, and left in a room off the kitchen.She haunted Len, who knew she was something special. And when, six months later, he’d unearthed a few bits and bobs himself, he asked the farmer if he could take her along with his own hoard, to be identified and dated at the Museum Resource Centre in nearby Standlake.The landowner agreed and Len lovingly swaddled her, plus body parts, in white tissue paper and placed her in a large sandwich box.‘The little head and the little arms were separate, so I got a plastic bag and popped them in. I was very careful. I knew she was important.’The minute the expert saw it, she was on the phone, one thing led to another and, last week, Len and Denise were up at dawn to attend the big unveiling ceremony at the British Museum.           Toby Jones and Mackenzie Crook in the third series of DetectoristsBecause Len had brought to light a 2,000-year-old, silver-eyed, copper alloy and lead statuette of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom.The mere sight of her sent historians, archaeologists and the curators at the British Museum into a frenzy and turned the orderly lives of Len, Denise, a legal secretary, and their two cats Rosie and Polly, upside down.Len became an instant celebrity. News channels from around the world wanted to interview him.‘They’re talking about this in Australia!’ he says. ‘It’s all very strange. We haven’t landed back on the floor yet.’ Meanwhile, Len’s fellow detectorists were thrilled for him and green with envy in equal measure. Because as anyone will know who has watched the Jackmans’ favourite show, BBC4’s award-winning Detectorists, starring Mackenzie Crook, Toby Jones and Rachael Stirling, there is an entire metal-detecting community out there.‘The programme is very, very true to form,’ says Len.So there are websites, Facebook groups, YouTube channels (Len’s personal favourite is iDetect, by a chap called Harry which has over 28,000 subscribers) and two dedicated magazines, The Searcher and Treasure Hunting. Some detectorists hunt in pairs, others prefer organised one-day rallies with an entrance fee.Len, however, prefers to search alone ‘so I can’t fall out with anyone’.Last year, though, he splashed out and bought Denise her own detector — an XP Deus that cost over £1,000.It was not a success. ‘I went once,’ she says. ‘A bitterly cold day and we were out for about four hours and I found nothing. That was enough.’Kenyan warriors compete in running, jumping and...Family of woman, 33, \u0027left for dead by drunk Tinder date...Mystery of woman, 33, who \u0027fell off the back of a motorcycle...Share this articleSo now she sticks to her cross stitch embroideries. Though she’s always on hand to help Len clean his treasures under the tap with an old toothbrush and sweep up the mud from the floor of their immaculate home.Len first caught the bug 20 years ago when he was working as a lorry driver at a nearby gravel pit, and a colleague mentioned he was a detectorist.‘I thought: “Ooh, I wouldn’t mind doing that!” ’So he bought himself a Viking metal detector for about £100, asked a local landowner if he could hunt on his land and that was that. It was the perfect hobby for Len. ‘I’m not interested in sport at all. I just really like walking round fields,’ he says. ‘And what I find might look like a load of old junk to some people, but I’ve always liked history, it’s just a shame we didn’t do more at school.’ He left aged 15 to work first as a tractor driver on a farm, then a coalman, before joining the gravel pit.‘I worked there for 38 years and eight months — all sitting down — so it’s nice to get out for a walk,’ he says.Until the Minerva his finds have been modest. Even so, like many detectorists, Len is rightly obsessive about secrecy. His number is ex-directory.He makes me promise not to ulge the name of his village, or include photos of his car, in case he’s followed. The location of the Minerva is top secret and must remain so. He even has a detectoring alias: ‘Alien.’‘Last week, a drone was following me!’ he says. ‘You have to be careful.’ Because while Len is a stickler for the rules — always seeking permission from landowners, declaring any interesting finds and carefully refilling any holes — some detectorists are not so responsible.‘I once had to tell another detectorist to clear off because he didn’t have permission!’ says Len. ‘People don’t read the rules. They justpick up a detector and think they can go anywhere when, of course, you can’t even go on public footpaths unless you have permission from the landowner.’Even worse are the ‘night hawkers’, detectorists who come out under cover of darkness. ‘They go out at night and dig holes and steal treasures,’ he says. ‘They give us a bad name. They spoil it for the rest of us who do things by the book.’(The Minerva is one of 78,000 archaeological items unearthed by the British public last year and voluntarily recorded with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, managed by the British Museum.)By now, we’re standing in sticky mud in a ploughed field at a secret location near Witney, in an area that used to be awash with Romans. Because Len has kindly agreed to bend his own rules and, just this once, detect a deux, giving me a lesson in how to ‘play’ a field.‘They also call it swinging. So I say to Denise: “I’m off swinging,” and she says: “I hope not, Len!” ’He shows me how to turn on my detector — Denise’s languishing XP Deus. How to twiddle the knobs to tune different metal types in or out and how to swing it ‘low and slow’ in smooth arcs just above the mud.Today it is bright and dry and glitteringly cold with a biting wind, but the chill just bounces off Len.‘I never feel it. I could go on for hours,’ he says. ‘Sometimes I get so engrossed I forget to eat my packed lunch!’          The Romano-British statuette of Minerva which was found in a margarine tub in Hailey, Oxfordshire You’d think that, just perhaps, a once-in-a-lifetime find like the Minerva — which has not yet had a monetary value ascribed to it, but is already wanted by a number of museums — might take the edge off future hunting. But no. ‘People ask me if I want a reward, but the biggest reward I could ask for is to walk round these fields and not be bothered by anyone.’I can see his point. Because despite the juddering cold, it’s rather nice walking across a stubbly field in thin wintery sun, waving Denise’s next to new XP Deus. Even better when it lets out a volley of beeps: Len rushes over and, after a bit of digging, a lot of probing and scrabbling about through the soil, we unearth an ancient buckle.‘Beginners’ luck!’ says Len, who brightens up no end when I give it to him for his collection. ‘Could be medieval!’ he beams. ‘I couldn’t say for sure, but definitely old.’And then he’s back in detectorist heaven, walking up and down, sweeping his machine — and dreaming of another beautiful Minerva. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1f102d8975d760b9bbe25f8158379ad6cbdcf5/0_185_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf25f9bfebbc4143f11fb369eeebab19","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"From Central American migrants stalled at the US border to the tallest pine tree in Switzerland – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bc3fd5cab5698c74224b1414fba50742446e04f/113_108_5214_3128/master/5214.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ce39ef93399cf91f6e5b29748e6634","title":"pantomime horses race from pub to pub in greenwich in pictures","story":"The London Pantomime Horse Race consists of running between pubs in Greenwich, with quite a lot of stopping for refreshments and games in between"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15dc91a714603369599ed96458d1732c10654ad8/53_119_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=810e11ced0ce10db13375ef4385829cb","title":"judith kerr interview tiger who came to tea teenagers kind idealistic","story":"At 95, the author of The Tiger Who Came to Tea still works every day. ‘Stories are a huge comfort,’ she says over lunch at the SavoyJudith Kerr has a theory about life. The first half of it, she suggests, lasts until you are about 18. All the rest counts as the second half. “Children’s years go on so long,” she says, “and pack so very much in.” Kerr’s own formative years – fictionalised in her book When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit – are more than a case in point. She escaped from Germany in 1933 with her mother and her father, who was a journalist and fierce critic of the Nazis. They lived for a while in France before being welcomed as refugees in London. She recalls being bombed out of a hotel in Bloomsbury in the blitz. “I was sleeping on a chest of drawers in the cellar,” she says. “Everyone expected the invasion any day and I knew we wouldn’t survive. I remember lying there thinking: ‘I’m 17, and I don’t yet know what I can do, and I would so like to find out.’”Seventy-eight years on Kerr could be forgiven for thinking that she has made good on that curiosity. She has written and illustrated 35 books for children that have sold more than four million copies. But she still reckons there is plenty more to do. Settling down amid the clink of china and plink of piano at Kaspar’s at the Savoy, at a table overlooking the lazy old river, she explains that she made sure she got an hour or two of work in that morning to ensure she could properly enjoy lunch: “Otherwise I’ll always tend to think the day has been wasted.”Any slight anxiety I’d had that, at 95, Kerr might be a little frail are dispelled at once. She is a twinkly presence, full of stories. She scans the menu, with its seafood specialities, and makes a quick choice of crab to start and lobster linguine to follow – “It all looks wonderful!” She takes little persuasion to join me in a glass of wine.“Miss Kerr”, as a waitress calls her, is something of a special guest here. In the adjacent room, a special “Tiger Who Came to Tea” spread is served for children in honour of her bestselling book. She celebrated her 95th birthday here with her publisher. “It was rather wonderful,” she says. “I looked out of the window and there was this beautiful fox walking along Embankment.”If Kerr comes into central London these days, she says, she will mostly use the bus or tube, because she likes to observe passengers, perhaps committing one or two details to memory to be sketched later. “If you can get people’s hands right, all the rest follows.” Since 1962 she has lived in the house in Barnes, west London that she bought with her husband Nigel “Tom” Kneale, the playwright and pioneering TV writer (of Quatermass and many other things) who died in 2006. She tries to be at her desk every morning, drawing or writing. In the evenings, or if she is stuck on an idea, she will walk the half mile to the river. “I can sit on the sofa and have an idea. But mostly I get to it by walking.” She has a book out for Christmas, Mummy Time – a nicely observed parable about a parent distracted by her phone – and another for older children that she is half way through.As she tucks into her crab starter, we talk about her inspiration to write. It came initially from her father. “All his books were burned quite early on by Goebbels. But they have been reprinted.” Alfred Kerr was a theatre critic, who instilled in Judith and her brother – Michael (who became Britain’s first foreign-born senior judge for 800 years) – a spirited independence. “My father grew up in a normal Jewish household and remembered it quite fondly, the candles and so on. But he didn’t believe in God and that was that. We didn’t go to RE at school. The other children would ask why,” she recalls. “Aged five I said what I had been told to say: ‘I am a free thinker!’”She wasn’t a fan of German children’s literature – “books about virtuous girls in the mountains who tended to die”. She loved instead a translation of Tom Sawyer. “I remember that opening: ‘“Tom!” Keine Antwort – “Tom!” No answer’ – I thought it was so wonderful to start a book like that, and put you right in the middle of the action.”Her father, 30 years older than her mother, returned to Germany just once. In 1948 the British government sent him back to Hamburg on a troop plane to attend a performance of Romeo and Juliet. The audience gave him a standing ovation when he walked in. Afterwards he went back to his hotel and collapsed. A friend found him the next morning. “I’ve had a stroke,” Alfred Kerr told him. “But it wasn’t the play. It was bad, but it wasn’t that bad.” There was no prospect of recovery and, secretly, Kerr’s mother helped her husband to end his life by smuggling some pills into the military hospital. The following morning, around his body, his bed was covered in notes. The last read: “I feel that I am dying.” “He wrote until the very last second,” Kerr says. “As any writer wants to.”As she tells this story, Kerr is working her way patiently through her linguine. “This is wonderful but slightly difficult to eat!” she admits, laughing, twirling her fork. “I will make sure I get all the lobster though.” She broke her wrist earlier in the year. “It was rather lucky,” she says, “because I tripped over when I was on my way to a hospital appointment, so I just carried on and they fixed it up. And it was my left hand too, so it hasn’t stopped me working.”I wonder if her experience of war made the childhood innocence she captures in her books all the more precious?“Well,” she says, “stories are a huge comfort when things are bad. Hugh Lofting wrote the first Doctor Dolittle novels in the trenches. There’s a charity I like that allows soldiers to record bedtime stories for their children at home to listen to.”Her first stories, about the tiger who came to tea, and Mog the cat, were told to her two children. It was her husband who encouraged her to write them down. “I learned from Tom that writing is all about shape,” she says. “With drawing I do feel now I know what I am doing. Writing I am less sure about.”Sometimes the creative process is so mysterious that she feels she can’t exactly claim credit for it. “If I think of something outrageous that works, I say to myself, ‘That’s come straight from Tom,’” she says. “We were married 52 years. He encouraged me so much.”As our plates are cleared we talk about how her new book reflects on the way parents in the park often seem more interested in their phones than their toddlers. Does she avoid technology?“When I got a mobile phone I said I want one that does nothing but make calls,” she says. “They told me: ‘This one has a torch too, is that OK?’ I felt I couldn’t go far wrong with a torch.”She has a computer which she uses to scan her drawings and for email. Her son, the novelist Matthew Kneale, lives in Rome with his family. I suggest that she must wish her grandchildren were a bit closer. “Oh no,” she says, “it’s nice to have the excuse to go to Rome. And when they come here, they see London as an exciting foreign city and they have great plans to visit places, which I enjoy.”She smiles. “I like this generation that are teenagers,” she says. “They seem kind. They like to cook. They are quite idealistic …”It’s a shame, I suggest, that they have not also been able to vote. Given her own European heritage I wonder what she makes of the mess we are in?“Oh, I still keep hoping for a second referendum,” she says. “The first was based on so many lies.” She recalls how somebody once asked her father after the war why he didn’t go back to France, where the food was better and he had more fluency in the language.

To quote that astute political observer Mr Zimmerman: “Your old road is Rapidly agin’  Please get out of the new one  If you can’t lend your hand.”It would be a serious exaggeration to say that Westminster has embraced this generational moment – but it is undeniable that the notion of a fresh referendum has moved, in the past 12 months, from the periphery of political discourse to the point where it is being seriously discussed in No 10. In response to a Sunday Times report that he was preparing for such a vote, Gavin Barwell, the prime minister’s chief of staff, tweeted this morning that he did not “want” and was not “planning” a second referendum – not quite an absolute denial, I would suggest.David Lidington, Theresa May’s de facto deputy, is also said to be in talks with Labour MPs on how to break the impasse. He and his fellow cabinet members Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond, David Gauke and Greg Clark, are certainly open to the idea of second referendum. I am cautious when any such groupings are instantly characterised as a disciplined caucus – in this case the “gang of five” – since the alignments in this extraordinary constitutional crisis are constantly changing, not least as inidual cabinet ministers weigh up their leadership prospects: one might call it agenda fluidity.The point, however, is that senior Tories are now discussing the option of a people’s vote. Their change of heart is not driven by principle or enthusiasm – none of them wants to go through the root-canal treatment of 2016 again – but practicality and empiricism.As ignominious for May as Wednesday’s confidence vote undoubtedly was, her treatment in Brussels on Thursday was much worse. Having assured her cabinet colleagues on the phone that she would bring home the legal assurances to make her 585-deal acceptable to the Commons, she came back with nothing to offer except a debate about the correct use of the word “nebulous”.Her agreement with Brussels is fit only for the political mortuary, and everyone knows this. Whether the “meaningful vote” in the Commons is held this week or on January 21 (the deadline), it is not coming back to life. None of the alternatives – “Norway-plus”, “Canada-plus-plus”, or variants thereupon – command a parliamentary majority. So the cabinet and MPs must now consider how they feel about a second referendum and a no-deal exit.I say “and” rather than “or” because the options are by no means mutually exclusive. Those cabinet ministers who have come round to a “managed no deal” – an oxymoron if ever there was one – know perfectly well that they have to do much more than run out the clock and march forth to glory on 29 March.For them, the worst outcome is a binary referendum in which the voters are offered a choice between May’s deal and remain. In such circumstances, remain would win by a mile. The Brexiteers would argue – for once, with some justice – that they had been shoddily treated. Hence, those ministers who believe no deal would be merely bumpy rather than completely catastrophic need urgently to persuade the public that it is eminently deliverable, true to the spirit of the 2016 referendum result, and (crucially) a lot better than the status quo of EU membership.Meanwhile, Liz Truss, the able chief secretary to the Treasury, is busily allocating a £2bn pot to deal with the challenges of a no-deal exit. That strikes me as a conservative figure, given what we already know about the implications of crashing out of the EU for healthcare, trade, haulage and transport.It seems to me that there would be a refreshing honesty in a referendum that offered voters a straightforward choice between remain and a no-deal exit. Nobody, on either side, could subsequently complain that the public had not known what it was choosing between.But I doubt that such a clarity of choice will be easily achieved.There are plenty of senior Tories and Labour figures who would only accept deal v no deal, on the grounds that a second referendum can only clarify rather than reverse the 2016 decision. Others favour a three-option ballot paper (deal, no deal, remain) with an “alternative vote” mechanism to determine the most acceptable option.The official Brexit date is little more than 100 days away. Yet in less than a week we have been whisked from “will May go ahead with the meaningful vote?” to “what should appear on the ballot paper in a second referendum?”So there is a festive whisper of hope that we might yet escape this mess. But only a whisper. It would be highly irresponsible to suggest that anyone is yet safe from – whatever is claimed to the contrary – the appalling risk of a no-deal tumble into the abyss. Because nobody is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc6903ec20826522f7629dd3e89147016e4ef0cb/0_40_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ce7dcfad833f05f706d072989e4b78","title":"the guardian view on cop24 while climate talks continue there is hope","story":"The first thing to say about the compromise struck at climate talks in Poland at the weekend is that it came as a relief. Ever since President Trump’s announcement in 2017 that the US would withdraw from the Paris agreement, the question has been whether the UN process could continue to work. Much like the communique that came out of the recent G20, the agreement on a set of rules to implement promises made in Paris shows that while multilateralism has been damaged, it is not dead. Flawed and inadequate though it is, the process that has developed since the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed in Rio in 1992 is still the best hope we have of staving off the most terrifying impacts of global warming.The sticking point of carbon credits, with new demands from Brazil regarding the treatment of forests, was pushed back to next year. But the agreement on how governments will measure and report on emissions cuts is important. The dynamic that previously pitted developing against developed countries has significantly shifted.Minds will now turn to the next deadline: 2020, when countries must demonstrate that they have met old targets and set new, much tougher ones. This round of talks, which the UK aims to host, is even more crucial following recent warnings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that current goals are nowhere near ambitious enough. While these set the planet on a course towards a 3C rise in temperatures, scientists believe even 1.5C would bring serious consequences. We have around 12 years in which to bring an unstable situation under control.Drastic changes to the global economy are the only option, underpinned by a rapid shift to low and zero-carbon energy, along with adaptation and mitigation measures including new mechanisms to manage migration. The US’s refusal, in Poland, to embrace the IPCC’s findings, along with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, was wrong-headed and a hint of troubles ahead. Next year UN secretary general António Guterres will attempt to break the logjam when he hosts a climate summit with heads of state.Once, the UK claimed a global leadership role on the environment, which was at least partly justified by the 2008 Climate Change Act. Political paralysis connected to Brexit is not the only reason why it now sits on the margins, while increasing cooperation between the EU and China is one of the more hopeful recent signs. The UK’s bid to host the 2020 summit should focus minds, not least on the contradictions of an energy policy that combines phasing out coal with the promotion of fracking. While the UN framework is essential, it cannot do the heavy lifting of cutting emissions, which will be done by nation states or not at all.This month’s pledge by Danish shipping giant Maersk to be carbon neutral by 2050 was important. Businesses too have a responsibility to the societies in which they operate. But governments cannot wait for the private sector, let alone the energy companies on whose riches so much of the global economy rests. They, and the politicians who champion them, are the vested interests against whom the battle for the future must be fought. Some long-term investors are starting to recognise the risks. So are more and more people, as extreme weather linked to warmer temperatures becomes more frequent. Greta Thunberg, the 15-year-old Swedish activist who addressed the UN in Poland, was right to say “the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa829e07afecc3289baa3e5d52e7d40b046c46a/0_0_2928_1757/master/2928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c02cd62ed800127f26c8a8822052fc","title":"observer obituaries 2018 emma chambers remembered by richard curtis","story":"11 March 1964 – 21 February 2018The writer-director on the comic genius of the Vicar of Dibley and Notting Hill star, who was a complex mixture of confident and insecure and who gave joy to millions• Chas Hodges remembered by Dave Peacock• Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2018 in full hereWell, of course, I’d rather I wasn’t writing this at all. It was a terrible shock and sorrow to lose Emma.From where I stood she was a remarkable and passionate woman with an amazing capacity for love and laughter and joy. And she was a truly wonderful actress with a particular genius for comedy. When people watched her in our Dibley show, they not only laughed – they also loved her and what they were loving was something real in Emma the person, an openness, a craziness, a sweetness. My daughter posted a picture of Emma on her Instagram account when she died and 4,000 people instantly reacted with love and comments. I particularly liked this one... “Emma always made the quirky best friend a so much funnier thing to be than the leading lady.” It’s no surprise they changed the BBC One schedules on the day Emma died to show an episode of her getting married in Dibley.She was precociously successful as an actress before I met her – swept up by Alan Ayckbourn right out of drama school – moving on to the National Theatre and starring in a play with the greatest English actor of our generation Ian McKellen. He loved her so much that she ended up living with him and calling him affectionately, cheekily – Hedgy. Because he is surprisingly similar to a hedgehog apparently.Then we were so lucky to get her in Dibley. And she was a gripping person to spend time with. The mixture of coquette and deep seriousness. The insecurity and the confidence. The laughter and the tears. She worked so hard – prepared so carefully – had such an amazing sense of perfect pitch, both in Dibley and in our film Notting Hill. She was one of the very finest comic actresses I’ve ever seen.She had such a range of wonderful ways of being – mock outrage, deep empathy, crazy high spirits. There was never a boring moment with Emma, which makes it all the worse that she’s gone.She was also a complicated, complicated woman – and later there were all sorts of puzzling things about her life. But the older I get, the more I realise that what’s wonderful about someone is probably what’s tricky about them too. You can’t have one without the other. The very passion that made her love and her acting so remarkable sometimes took her off the rails. The insecurity that made her so touching and so demanding of herself also made her genuinely insecure. But that was her package: you just can’t say: “Oh, I wish this hadn’t been the case” because then all the marvellous stuff would have to be taken down a notch too and she’d have been a different and less dazzling person.Emma brought joy and empathy to millions of people and to those of us who loved her. She had unusual beauty and grace and wit and passion. I feel hugely lucky to have known her and miss her so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a622094f87a1ccb0f7b182b8fd63fee4f1d7a9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac29dcd5d94e5e743e1d24875ae40eaf","title":"quick and easy roast chicken with a twist","story":"Cookery writer Eve Marleau adds a French-inspired twist to a traditional roast chicken with Boursin As a kid in the late 80s and early 90s, for me, Boursin had one role – to act as an exotic option on the Christmas cheeseboard. In my prime, I could eat upwards of 10 Carr’s table water biscuits slathered in Boursin after seconds of turkey pie and an inordinate amount of chocolate mould dessert.But as a grownup – and as someone who gets more excited over the possibilities contained within the leftovers than the initial purpose of an ingredient – the garlicky cheese with the chant-inducing advert has come to represent versatility as well as comforting familiarity. I’ve long been stirring Boursin through fettuccine with lemon-roasted broccoli, or dolloping spoonfuls on top of slow-roasted red peppers, tomato and fennel. I’ve whisked it with milk to make the sauce for potato dauphinois, combined with soured cream, red onions and prawns, and even spread it on stale sourdough, scattered with pancetta and baked with whisked eggs to make a savoury bread and butter pudding. As an ingredient, it is undeniably simple yet effective, saving the lives of many a withered fridge companion. However, my favourite use is a relatively recent discovery, from a French friend: a roast chicken recipe – with a twist.Requiring only three ingredients: Boursin, lemon and the chicken itself. One Boursin is stuffed into the bird’s cavity with half a lemon, and a second is smeared underneath and over the top of the skin. And that’s it. The result is a creamy, flavoursome and perfectly textured meat that the carver will undoubtedly be standing over and picking at long before it reaches the table.Since learning of this dish a few years back, I’ve found that it’s the perfect recipe for those mellow days between Christmas and the new year, when families are still gathered, but the enthusiasm for spending hours in the kitchen to create a celebratory spread for those around you has dissipated to eating cold stuffing and cranberry sauce from the fridge on the sofa. This roast chicken requires no more than five minutes of preparation, a chopping board and a roasting tin. But the best thing about this recipe? It perfectly balances familiarity and nostalgia with indulgence – and that’s exactly what the festivities are all about.1 free-range organic chicken2 x 150g Boursin½ lemonSalt and ground black pepper1 bunch purple sprouting broccoli, ends trimmed25g butterZest of 1 lemonRoast or mashed potatoes, to servePreheat your oven to 180Cgas mark 4.Remove the string from the chicken and stuff one of the Boursin into the cavity along with the lemon half. Ease the skin of the chicken loose, then spread half of the other Boursin under the skin, using your fingers. Spread the other half over the skin of the whole bird and season well.Lightly oil a roasting tray and place the chicken inside. Cook for 1-1½ hours, until the juice of the chicken runs clear when a knife is inserted into the thickest part of the leg. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.As the chicken is resting, steam or boil the broccoli, then toss with the butter, lemon zest and some seasoning. Carve the chicken and serve with the broccoli and potatoes.Bring a BoursinCombining a creamy, crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

Like all my movies, we’re trying to recreate history and bring you back in time,” said the producer Donald Rosenfeld, former president of Merchant Ivory Productions, who made period classics such as Howards End, starring .Emma Thompson. He and Andreas Roald at Sovereign Films have just acquired the film rights to Paul Kildea’s book, Chopin’s Piano: A Journey Through Romanticism, which traces the history of Chopin’s masterpiece, the 24 Preludes, through the instruments on which they were played.The film-maker has also secured permission to use two of Chopin’s pianos, part of the collection created by Alec Cobbe over 50 years at Hatchlands Park, a Georgian National Trust property in Surrey. “These instruments evoke a completely different response to the music. They’re magical,” said Cobbe.Rosenfeld said Kildea’s book, originally published by Allen Lane, had inspired a “dream project” about a musical genius, more than 30 years after Miloš Forman’s Amadeus, a film about the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri that won eight Oscars.Exploring the nature of artistic inspiration, the film will tell the story of how, in 1838, a sickly Chopin went to Mallorca with his lover George Sand to escape the Parisian winter. They settled in an abandoned monastery, where Chopin was “close to all that is most beautiful”, but struggled to compose without a decent instrument. He told his publisher: “I dream of music, but I can’t write any because there are no pianos to be had here – in that respect it is a barbarous country.” Using a small piano, a pianino, made by a local craftsman, he composed some of his most sublime music.Rosenfeld said: “The circumstances of the writing of the Preludes, the trip to Mallorca, Chopin’s volatile relationship with Sand, will be brought painstakingly to light. He also wrote some of the greatest work he ever made in that terrible time.”The film, which goes into production next year, will follow Chopin to Paris and on his concert tour of England and Scotland.It will also cross two centuries, extending to Wanda Landowska, the Polish pianist who acquired the pianino – only to have it seized by the Nazis as a symbol of a composer they wanted to claim as their own.Rosenfeld, whose films include Voyage of Time, narrated by Cate Blanchett, says of the Oscar-winning actress: “I think she would be great as Sand,” but he wants to discover a new talent to play Chopin. Of Trifonov, who has won many international competitions and performed with the world’s top orchestras, Rosenfeld said: “He is the greatest modern performer of Chopin. He visited Cobbe’s collection and didn’t want to leave. He loved the instruments.”He also produced Effie Gray, about John Ruskin’s loveless marriage, which recreated exquisite details of Pre-Raphaelite paintings. Now he wants to recreate authentic sounds, performing Chopin’s works in their entirety rather than as “soundbites.” “It’s going to be a beautiful movie driven by its music.”Of Cobbe’s 47 keyboards, 18 are linked to composers. While the pianino is missing, he owns the Pleyel that Chopin brought with him to England, keeping it in his lodgings and playing it at his London debut. He said: “Everything about it, the depth, the touch was tailored to the client – Chopin.”In London, Chopin chose three Broadwood pianos, including one that he played at the Guildhall, among other recitals, which is on permanent loan to the Cobbe Collection Trust from the Royal Academy of Music. It and the Pleyel are likely to feature in the film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203ab960337e5d3a10d3638906220d3386d8287f/0_525_1146_687/master/1146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0059d833063c6139df99ddfecfb2a4b8","title":"best thing i ate in 2018","story":"Tacos in Philadelphia, doughnuts in Cleethorpes, grilled lamb in Istanbul – cooks and writers including Prue Leith, Nathan Outlaw and Clare Smyth pick their culinary highlightsThe Mani is the central peninsula of three that extend southwards in the Peloponnese on mainland Greece. One road basically takes you from Kardamyli near where I have a house to the deepest tip, Cape Tenaro (aka Cape Matapan), where in antiquity it was believed there was a hidden entrance to Hades. En route is the village of Nomitsi known for its cluster of Byzantine churches with their remarkably lucid frescoes but also, I discovered early this summer, the chips at a taverna run by the Xerovassilas family.Greek potatoes are a wonder. In cooking they do everything you want a potato to do, and taste profoundly of a large landmass with a small population who have no need of intensive farming. Kalamata and its surrounds are justly famed for olive oil. When the two meet, as chips fried and stacked up with years of expertise, salted and sprinkled with rigani (Greek oregano) and served alongside simply grilled organic lamb and pork, there is an elemental straightforwardness that perfectly bears out Escoffier’s command: “Faites simple.” And as we worked our way through the golden pile in the evening warmth, on the TV hung in the trees England beat Tunisia in the World Cup.I had this on a beach in the Seychelles. When the mature coconut drops to the ground and sprouts, it gets a shoot that comes out of it. If you crack it open then you get something like coconut milk but it has a meringue texture. It’s a meringuesponge that tastes like coconut water. My wife is from the Seychelles, and everyone on the island knows about it but takes it for granted. They kind of eat it, but more to show foreigners about the different textures of coconut. Every foreigner thinks it’s the best thing since sliced bread. The coconuts you get abroad are so mature – all you get is water and they’re rock hard. Or, you get the young jelly stage. It’s very difficult to get that semi-germinated stage anywhere else. In the Seychelles there are loads of medicinal uses for it as well – they use it to cure migraines, rub it on bites. They call it coco-gem.Tom Kerridge sent me a copy of his book, and it has a recipe which has minced lamb, cauliflower and lentils all in one – like a keema. My wife cooked it, and it was incredible. Because of my heritage, Punjabi, I know keema really well, I know aloo gobi really well, I know dal really well. So it’s a combination of all three. You cook the mince with spices, some stock and cauliflower – and it’s puy lentils he uses, not red or yellow, but they thicken it – and you get this keema with the dal and the cauliflower already in it. It’s fulfilling, it’s spicy, it’s got this beautiful depth, and it’s evocative. I tasted it and I thought, “Oh my God” – I was like the critic in Ratatouille.I’ve tasted keema all my life, and to have an English girl make it from an English chef’s cookbook is quite funny, but that to me is British cooking: it’s a magpie cuisine. The key is contrast you have really cool crunchy strips of chicory, fennel, onion and cucumber – cold out the fridge – and you put it with yogurt and mint and coriander, and this warm spicy mince and you have it in a wrap. I’ve eaten in some of the best places in the world this year – I’ve just come back from New York, so I went to Blue Hill, I went to Per Se, I went to Eleven Madison, and I went to Noma this year as well – but this recipe blew my mind.It was a Berkshire pig and it was aged for 55 days and it was just delicious. We had half an animal and we cooked it over fire. We cooked the bellies and chops over wood for our yearly barbecue with the team, and turned the other cuts into coppa and pancetta, and we made sausages. The quality was amazing – it’s from Robin and Andrew Mackay in the Lake District. They have a smallholding and deal with rare breeds, so they only have a certain amount, but when they’re ready they sell the animal rather than cuts. Then our suppliers age it for 55 days. It really is something special. Obviously, using the whole animal is so important. It’s how we should eat meat, not just for the sake of eating tonnes of it from any source. We just need to think a little bit more about what we’re eating.I went to Xu for lunch with a friend in April and said: “Yeah, we’re not going to pig out, we’ll just have some dumplings.” But we ended up having the chicken. It’s roasted in a charcoal oven and comes in a clay pot. You think, oh chicken, it’s not going to be very interesting, but it was delicious, with ginger and spring onions and a very light sauce with aged white soy.Since I’m just back from three weeks in Japan, you’d think my best mouthful would be one of the freshest sashimi or a bowl of ramen. In fact, it was a doughnut. Deep-fried with those spiky, crisp panko crumbs on the outside, then a layer of doughbread, then semi-liquid spicy veg curry, and in the middle a whole egg with runny yolk. We bought it from a station stall in Fukuoka’s Hakata station before getting on the bullet train. I’d have liked to rave, as everyone does and should, about that whole experience: deep luxury, spotless everything, wonderful service, a great bento box prepped by renowned chefs. I guess the doughnut had spoiled my appetite, but it lingers in my memory in a way the bento box and the Michelin-starred sushi, doesn’t. It was ine on every level: crisp fried outside, soft doughnut-textured bread, mildly spicy but zingy curry, perfect “four-minute” egg. I’m determined to recreate it, maybe even for a Bake Off technical challenge.Prue: My All-Time Favourite Recipes is out now (Bluebird)Nieves Barragán Mohacho, chef-director and co-founder, SaborThere is a restaurant called DiverXO in Madrid, and the chef Dabiz Muñoz also has a restaurant called StreetXO and there is one in London.

Now and then I go there just to eat this, because it is so good.I went to Turkey to research how they cook lamb: shawarma, doner … I wanted to make sure I knew everything about the kebab. They’ve been cooking lamb over open fire there for 1,000 years, so I figured if there’s someone who knows how to cook a lamb perfectly that would be Mehmet Gürs. I was not disappointed.Mehmet is the head chef of Mikla, which is often called the best restaurant in Istanbul. He’s also got a Finnish-Swedish mother, and he’s fluent in Swedish, so he’s the best guy ever in Turkey for me. What I learned was how they use fat: the lamb fat is actually the most important thing in the shish kebab and the doner. Often they use tail fat from the lamb, cut that into pieces, and then add veal and lamb and chilli flakes, and cook that over an open fire. It’s insanely good.Vivek Singh, executive chef and CEO, The Cinnamon ClubClare Smyth does a beautiful dish with potatoes and trout roe. It’s the kind of thing you don’t really expect on a tasting menu, especially a really high-end one, but it was quite stunning. The potatoes must have been confited for hours, then she has this seaweedy, salty beurre blanc that really does taste of the sea, and then the trout roe. She’s playing with the caviar and potato experience but making it personal, paying homage to her Northern Irish roots.For the last year I’ve been working at Dan Barber’s restaurant, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in upstate New York, and I’ve had so many of the best bites of my life. The best stone fruit, the best butter, the best lamb (from milk-fed Katahdin sheep)… But I don’t want to look biased. And the absolute moment this year when I thought, “Holy Cow!” was at B Patisserie. It is a cafe run by Belinda Leong and it’s known for its kouign amann, a layered pastry made with incredible amounts of butter and sugar. I mean, of course it’s going to be delicious, right? But what makes B’s so phenomenal is how light it is. I’ve tried so many that are delicious but very heavy and hers was just mind-boggling: so crisp and so buttery. San Francisco was my last stop travelling before I returned home and sitting there, this amazing Motown music playing, eating that kouign amann was the perfect way to end my adventure.The best tacos I’ve ever eaten. They keep what they do quite secret, but I did a pop-up there in October and I saw a little of what went on in their tiny kitchen. They start cooking the lamb at about 8pm, and the meat cooks all night until they serve their first customer at 5am. There’s a queue even at that time, of construction workers mainly, and it stays open until it sells out of food, usually around 3.30pm. South Philly Barbacoa is run by Cristina Martinez and her husband Ben Miller and – especially since it was on Netflix’s Chef’s Table – people come from all over the world because of her story of how she emigrated to the US years ago, crossing the desert at huge personal risk. When I was there, this is no lie, I met two guys who came from Canada just to eat there and then flew back.Andi Oliver, broadcaster and chef-owner, Andi’sFor an episode of The Food Programme on the autumnal equinox, I went to this incredible restaurant in Somerset. First I went for a walk around their walled gardens, which felt like something out of Narnia or The Secret Garden – it was so beautiful. Then I had a sea bream dish with agretti, or monk’s beard. I love greens and this is a cross between samphire, asparagus, dill fronds and Chinese broccoli – all my favourite things in the world. The bream was beautifully cooked with crisp skin and flaky flesh. Then they made a buttery sauce with mussels and cockles and ran the agretti through that. That piece of fish with that buttery sauce on the autumnal equinox … I was transported. There was basically no point talking to me for about 20 minutes. I loved it so much.I had an unusual and surprising dish at Noma at the beginning of the year. It was shrimp and fermented strawberries in a broth made from green gooseberries, blackcurrant wood oil (from the branches) and mussel stock. It also had a “chicken skin” on top made from reduced chicken stock. I thought it was going to be weird, but it was super tasty. It worked because of the texture of the strawberries: they were extremely soft, and had no sweetness because they had been fermented – they were kind of salty. It was one of the first services at the restaurant featuring that menu, and it was my favourite dish that night – and still is for the year.I cooked at Wheelers in the autumn, for the new food festival. It’s a tiny oyster bar that’s been running for years. I cooked with Stephen Harris from the Sportsman and Dan Smith from the Fordwich Arms. Dan did the main course and I did the pudding. For the starter, Stephen seared the monkfish on the outside, slow-cooked it for half an hour, took it off the bone, and served it with lemon juice, salt, cep powder and a cep and bergamot sauce. After he’d served his course, there were a few bits left over so we all just tucked in. Part of the pleasure was that I wasn’t expecting to try it. Erchen Chang, co-founder, Bao and XuIn May, my husband Shing and I went on holiday to South Korea. Friends recommended a traditional restaurant, which felt very local and no-frills. There were water tanks with crabs sunbathing outside the restaurant. The dish sounded simple, but it takes several rounds of marinating in a soy, sesame oil, ginger, garlic mixture and re-boiling until the crab is ready to be chilled and served. The flesh of the crab is jelly-like – both visually and in texture. I have always been obsessed with jelly and this was the first time that I tried the savoury kind. I loved that it was so sweet and umami at the same time. I put the hot rice into the shell and mixed it with the glistening orange roe, then sucked the legs so the cold crabmeat oozed out and met the marinade. The temperature was hot and cold, the dish sweet and salty. The whole meal was messy, with sauces dripping everywhere.Lee Tiernan’s menu at Black Axe is filled with familiar Turkish comfort dishes, but with a twist. The nutty, buttery nature of the bone marrow with that salty anchovy kick, all topped off with a pickled red onion salad – it really makes for a mouth-wateringly good dish. Kudos to them, I just want to go back for more.My husband Giorgio has been away quite a lot this year doing Italy’s MasterChef, and he came home and said: “I’ve really got to eat Chinese food.” So I had a look online and Yipin in Islington came up Jay Rayner reviewed it years ago and it’s been there forever. It’s a caff really, run by this very sweet family who are always there. They do the most incredible fish soup. It’s so simple: just sea bass, rice noodles, herbs and spices, but it has this extraordinary, complex depth of flavour. We just sat in silence eating it. It comes in this enormous bowl so we shared that with some greens and felt very virtuous. I went to the Cow a couple of months ago and had a whole crab with half a dozen Mersea oysters. As a chef who cooks with seafood all the time, I sometimes don’t appreciate the ceremony of just sitting there and cracking open a whole crab. It was a hen crab and the brown meat was such good quality. I had it with lemon, bread and mayonnaise. I’m quite particular with oysters: I eat the first two with nothing on them, then I’ll have two with shallot vinegar, and the final two with just a bit of lemon. I think I only had two pints of Guinness but it may have been three. It may have been four.I had a funny weekend in Italy in February where I couldn’t find anything to eat. I’d gone to visit a lakeside town famous for growing rare types of citrus fruit, which I like to collect to make into nougat. The place was dead other than for a group of elderly Germans squelching round under umbrellas following an “orange trail” that led to pots of homemade jam and amateur painting and photography exhibitions featuring the colour orange.I spent two days eating crisps and then by the Sunday morning, famished and freezing, decided to drive to Switzerland to look for food. I found a bakery with steamed-up windows. It was called Pasticceria Marnin and when I pushed my way in, smelled warm and of eggs. I bought a slice of rhubarb tart and a cup of very hot black coffee at the bar. The tart was excellent – made with quite green garden rhubarb that was barely cooked through, set in a runny sweet cream base with a crunchy crust. I have never tasted cream like it. I have thought about it a lot since and like to think it might have been made with the fabled mountain cream: crème Gruyère. It saved the weekend.In September, I had the great pleasure of eating at Feitoria, João Rodriguez’s restaurant in Lisbon. What stood out was this dish of carabineros, the large red prawns you find in the Algarve. They’re from 200m below sea level so they’re incredibly sweet, the meat’s very red – it’s a product we’re really proud of in Portugal. João roasts the heads on the grill and puts them through an old-school duck press to extract all the juices, and serves the juices along with the lightly warmed prawns. It’s so simple, but so good, and showcases the whole product.There’s a train route that runs from the Lincolnshire coast, through Sheffield and across the northern edge of the Peak District into Manchester. When I lived in Sheffield, I got this train all the time. If I were to ask you where on that long train line I had the best food I’d eaten all year, you probably wouldn’t guess a quiet stick-of-rock-and-a-couple-of-quid-for-the-arcades seaside town perched on the southern edge of the Humber estuary. Not somewhere swish in Manchester or in Sheffield’s lively street food scene. No, it was Cleethorpes, and it was doughnuts.I’m from Southend-on-Sea, so I already have a soft spot for slightly tatty seaside resorts but these doughnuts were something else. Maybe it was the old-fashioned charm of the shop itself, right on the beach under a little awning. Maybe the magic was in the heat of the doughnuts against the chill of that not-quite-summer-yet sea breeze. Perhaps it was the fact that my fingers were left glistening with sugar and my lips greasy with every mouthful. It definitely helped that they were £1.50 for five. Whatever the secret ingredient was, those sweet, cakey, golden, lopsided little doughnuts left me beaming, and, I’ll admit, bloated, the whole way home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d9922d46eb1adfa7f72ee141ad671c2f76de60/0_233_4402_2642/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fa75669d032b387bee23f1a9a0e43d3","title":"four recipes best food writers 2018","story":"Dishes from OFM’s favourite food books of the year, including roast pork with fennel seed from Gill Meller’s Time and duck legs with clementines from Honey \u0026amp Co At HomeI first tasted makrut lime leaves (also known as kaffir) in Bombay when I went to my friend Praphat’s home for dinner. Praphat’s mother, Sriwan, who is from Thailand, cooked us an elaborate meal made with fresh herbs and spices and the leaves of a makrut lime tree, which grew in her backyard. She would pluck the fresh leaves off her tree and toss them into hot oil, which she used to start a soup. Taking a page out of Sriwan’s book, I add makrut leaves to ghee, after infusing it with turmeric and ginger. Serve with a slice or two of buttered and toasted baguette. You can find makrut lime leaves in most Asian shops and in the international aisles of some supermarkets. This broth also works great with clams.Rinse the mussels under cold running water, scrubbing well to remove any grit. Keep on ice in the refrigerator while building the broth.In a heavy medium stockpot, heat the ghee over medium-high heat. Sauté the shallots until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garam masala and turmeric root and cook for 1 more minute. Add the lime leaves and Kashmiri chilli and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in the tomato paste and ginger and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the salt and the coconut milk, and then gently stir in the mussels. Cover the stockpot and cook until the mussels open, 12 to 15 minutes. Discard any unopened mussels. Stir in the lime juice and taste – add more salt, if necessary. Garnish the broth with the spring onions and serve immediately.NOTE In this broth, the fresh turmeric root adds a beautiful golden colour, while the fresh ginger adds spiciness and texture. Both of them possess starch, which helps thicken the broth as it is heated. To maximise the impact of the aromatic ingredients, I heat them in a flavourful fat, such as ghee or, if you can find it, the Ethiopian spiced butter nit’r qibe. The coconut milk and mussels absorb these flavours as they cook. The addition of lime leaves and juice brightens the broth and counterbalances the heat.Full of bold colours, textures and flavours, this is a super salad to try in the midwinter months when citrus fruits are at their best.You can use dried grapefruit or orange “crisps” (shop-bought or homemade) instead of fresh grapefruit for an extra crunch, but juicy fruits really complete this dish.Serves 1radicchio 1 headpink grapefruit 1gorgonzola cheese a small wedge (I just go by eye)toasted almonds a small handfulthyme leaves from 1 sprigFor the dressingolive oil 2 tbspsherry or wine vinegar of choice 1 tbspwholegrain mustard 1 tspplain or acacia honey 1 tspsea salt and freshly ground black pepperWash the radicchio and either peel the leaves all the way off or give the head a rough chop.Place the leaves in a shallow pasta bowl or on a dinner plate, then peel the grapefruit, slice the flesh (thickly enough that the slices hold their shape) and scatter it on top. Place little bites of gorgonzola around the salad. Scatter over the almonds and thyme leaves.Mix the dressing ingredients together in a jam jar or cup (if using a jam jar, just seal and give it a really good shake to emulsify) and taste. I like a very punchy, vinegar-rich dressing for this salad but if you prefer a more traditional vinaigrette, simply add a spoonful or two more olive oil until you have the consistency and flavour you like.Drizzle the dressing on top of the salad and keep any spare for dunking bread into.From Solo: The Joy Of Cooking for One (Bluebird, £16.99)What are apples without pork? And pork without crackling? Perfect crackling relies on the pork skin to be exceptionally dry. Take the pork out of its packaging as soon as you can, thoroughly dry the skin with kitchen paper or a clean tea towel, then leave it uncovered in the bottom of the fridge for at least 24 hours (48 hours would be better).Make sure the skin is scored properly, down through to the fat (of which there should be some) and salt it only as it goes in the oven, not before.Serves 6pork loin about 2kg, scored and tiedred onion 1, cut into 8-10 wedgesapples 8 small, such as Coxʼslemons 2, sliced into 5mm roundssage 1 small bunch, leaves pickedbay leaves 8thyme 1 small bunchfennel fronds a handful, if availablesalt and freshly ground black pepperfennel seeds 2 tsp, lightly bashedolive oil 2 tbspHeat the oven to 230Cgas mark 8, or as hot as your oven will go. Place the pork (with its very dry skin – this is really important as we want it to crackle) on a suitably sized roasting tin. Season all over with salt, then place in the hot oven for 25-30 minutes. Once the crackling is looking good, remove the pork and turn the oven down to 190Cgas mark 5 .Scatter the red onion wedges over the base of a large, clean ovenproof dish. Carefully lift the pork from the hot roasting tin and set it down on top of the onions.Place the whole apples around the pork, arrange the lemon slices in between them, scatter over the sage leaves, bay, thyme and fennel fronds (if using), and season well with salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the crushed fennel seeds and trickle everything with the olive oil.Place the fragrant pork and apples in the oven and cook for a further 35 minutes, until the pork is cooked through and the apples are soft but not collapsing. (It’s worth noting that if the apples look like they are going to collapse, you can take them out of the oven and allow the pork to finish cooking without them.)Remove the pork dish from the oven and allow the meat to rest in a nice, warm place for 10-15 minutes. Serve everyone a few thick slices of pork, some generous strips of crackling, an apple and some lemony, herby juices.From Time (Quadrille, £25)This should be the centrepiece for your next Christmas meal, it looks so festive and wintery. The apricots will soak up all the lovely duck juices, the skin will crisp and the whole thing will make you want to snuggle by the fire.Don’t be intimidated by duck. This is the simplest thing to cook and really excellent for entertaining as it will not dry out, and can also be made in advance and reheated to serve. The only thing to take into account with this recipe is that the duck legs need to be salted before cooking: a day ahead, if you can, or at least 6 hours as a minimum.Dinner for 6-8duck legs 8For the salt rubtable salt 2 tbspground cinnamon 1 tspground coriander 1 tspfreshly ground black pepper 1 tspground ginger 1 tspFor roastingonions 2, peeled and cut into wedgesclementines 2, quartereddried apricots 150gbay leaves 2star anise 2Mix the salt rub ingredients together and sprinkle over both sides of the duck legs. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge for at least 6 hours, but ideally about 24 hours.Heat your oven to 220Cgas mark 7 and place the duck legs in one layer in a deep roasting tray. Roast in the oven for about 20-25 minutes or until the skin starts to colour. Carefully drain off the fat (you can keep it to roast some potatoes on another day – it lasts for ages in the fridge).Add the onion wedges and clementines to the tray, and return to the oven for another 15 minutes. Remove the tray again, add the apricots, bay leaves and star anise, and then pour over enough water to reach just halfway up the duck legs (you may need a little more or a little less than 600ml, depending on the size of your tray).Reduce the oven temperature to 180Cgas mark 4.Cover the tray, return to the oven and cook for another 40 minutes.Remove the cover and check the liquid level – it should still reach about halfway up the legs. Baste all over, re-cover and return to the oven for another 30 minutes.Remove the cover, baste again and return to the oven for 15 minutes, before basting one last time. Push any apricots into the liquid so that they don’t burn, then cook for a final 15 minutes to finish crisping up the skin.From Honey \u0026amp Co At Home: Middle Eastern Recipes From Our Kitchen (Pavilion Books, £26) This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

As a child, growing up with five siblings, her mother did the same, cramming the glass plate from the bottom of the microwave with rice. For her, it was about efficiency, making sure every child was fed quickly, and with the least washing up for Hussain it’s the opposite, a slowing down. A moment.“I know the idea of using your hands to feed one kid and then the same hand to feed the other, lots of people are almost disgusted by that. But to be able to sit with your children around you, with rice and curry…” She shrugs, smiling. Since winning Bake Off three years ago, making millions cry with her promise “I’m never going to put boundaries on myself ever again”, and embarking on a career that has included but not been limited to: three BBC series, three cookbooks, three children’s books, and one novel, her family’s food traditions have taken on a luminous, almost magical importance. “My kids still cannot eat rice with a spoon, they only use their fingers, and that’s a tradition I’ve kept. Once a month we have ‘dessert for dinner’ night. I’ll make four separate desserts. They’ll come home from school and eat as much cake and custard and ice cream as they can physically get in their guts. Because sometimes I think, let them just be children. And that’s nice, because it allows the child in you to come out as well.”Hussain never planned to become famous. So famous that she must stop for selfies with strangers, so famous that the nurse asked “What’s Paul Hollywood like?” in the middle of a smear test. She never planned to be a cook, or a writer, or to go on telly – her husband Abdal filled out her Bake Off application. “He did it because I have a panic disorder, and I suffer with anxiety, and he knew that I’d given so much of myself to him and the kids that I’d stopped doing anything for me.” She never planned to refocus food TV away from professionals. She never planned to become a national treasure, one that humanised and disproved the tabloid image of a dangerous, repressed hijab-wearing Muslim in part by being, well, lovely, or, as Professor Ted Cantle, who wrote the government report on the 2001 race riots in northern England, put it, “do more for British-Muslim relations than 10 years of government policy”.“Yeah, that feels really … heavy on my shoulders,” she says. “But also, quite a privilege, quite an honour, even just to hear that sentence out loud.”And, of course, she never planned to bake the Queen’s 90th birthday cake. “It’s mad, because I’m just this five-foot-one Muslim brown girl with three kids, who kind of … had a life before all of this. I never dreamed of doing anything other than that. I only ever baked because it helped with my anxiety.” At one point she was spending half the week in bed, something she’s tentatively started using Instagram to document. “I am as average as they get – there is nothing special about me. I’m just getting by. You know, I just want an easy life. I want to,” she is emotional suddenly, her eye contact hypnotic – her proportions are doll-like, her gaze is earnest, “I want to raise children who I can give back to society and say, ‘Here you go. This is the product of me,’ and I want to be proud of that. And that’s all I really want out of life.”Rather than the hijab which, to her parents’ bemusement, she started wearing at 14, or her arranged marriage to Abdal (their love affair happened backwards: “We fell in love after two kids,” she says), it could be argued that the most controversial thing about Hussain, who is noisily blowing her nose, is the way she insists on the importance of the role of a housewife. “When I was a stay-at-home mum, people would ask me, ‘So what do you do?’ and I’d say: ‘I’m a housewife.’ The looks that I used to get! The more I heard, ‘So, when are you going to get an actual job?’ the less I valued the job that I did. I think that’s really sad, because it meant I didn’t value or understand the importance of what I was doing at the time. Now, looking back, had I known I would be doing this,” she gestures around the vast photography studio where we sit, her stylist and makeup artist packing up their bags in the light of a Hollywood vanity mirror, “I think I would have appreciated being at home with my kids a little bit more. Raising a child, surely that in itself is the biggest thing we’re ever going to do?” She doesn’t have a cleaner, or a nanny – she and her husband share the responsibilities of running their home, “because that’s our job”. One benefit of being a stay-at-home mum was that it allowed Abdal to flourish in his career – now they’ve switched. “It’s his turn – he spends more time with the kids, picking them up, dropping them off and, well, he can’t cook so … reheating food I’ve cooked? But my kids see me doing something I enjoy, and I always ask them, ‘Who’s got the better job, Daddy or me?’ and they always say me, because Daddy works in IT, and IT cannot give you cakes.”And yes, she can give her children cakes, but the more unexpected detail of her professional life, is what cakes have given her. “If you’d asked a couple of years ago, I would have said I just wanted to bake. But actually, this is more than a job.” She raises her chin. “I realise the importance of being out there now, because growing up I didn’t see girls like me on television. I didn’t see brown skin. I didn’t see people from ethnic minorities. I didn’t see girls with headscarves. Until Goodness Gracious Me, the TV screen was white.”It strikes me that she is extremely good at talking, this 33-year-old mother with a panic disorder, and it would have been a terrible waste of talent if her husband had not persuaded her to go on TV. Good at talking – it sounds like nothing. But such a skill, ideally (as in Hussain’s case) when accompanied with intelligence and something to say, is a rare thing, and one that will undoubtedly carry her through a number more careers after the cakes have cooled. Whatever she touches is imbued with cosiness. “I’m there to create the space. And what I’m hoping is, by staying in mainstream television and doing what I love, I can create that space for generations to come.”Part of that though, involves fielding abuse, both as a person in the public eye and as a Muslim woman in the world. Last year she told her 198,000 Twitter followers that a man had moved away from her on a train, saying, “I ain’t sitting near a Muslim.”“There was a time when I would just stay very quiet, but now I think it’s really important to speak up. Because if they said it to my kids I’d nudge them and say: ‘Don’t shy away. Don’t cower, don’t take it.’”This inner confidence is inherited. One weekend, as a child in Luton, Hussain went to the market with her father Jamir to buy a chainsaw. “We were like, ‘What does he need a chainsaw for? He works in a restaurant.’ He said, ‘You’ll see.’” He went out, and told his family to clear the dining table before he returned. Through the window they watched him come, stumbling slightly, a dead sheep across his shoulders. “He’s only a little man, about five-foot-six, and kind of plodding up the road, and all you can see is this dead carcass and Dad. And he’s like, ‘Get out the way!’ He slaps this sheep down onto the table and goes, ‘Who wants to see how you chainsaw a sheep?’ And that’s what he did. The freezer was full of meat for at least a month.”Her Bangladeshi family have stomachs of steel, she boasts, partly because of their diet of fermented fish, but also because of her father’s experimental cooking, and his insistence that everybody must clean their plate, regardless of whether or not the “mussels curry” he’d made (having let the mussels sit in the sink for a day or two, and having pried open any that refused to open) was fresh. And his excitement about the possibilities of tinkering with traditional dishes has been passed down – see, for instance, her “chaat in a bag” recipe, using tortilla chips and ketchup, and her samosa pie, and her obsession with the humble tinned peach.After the kids have gone to bed, Hussain will take a breath, and glance at Twitter. Sometimes it’s full of people telling her she’s not a good enough Muslim, sometimes not a good enough Brit, sometimes not a good enough mother. “I’ve had comments saying things like, ‘Get out of our country,’ suggesting that I don’t belong here. I’m not going to take that. I’m just not. This is my country, this is my home. I will not be told to leave. Never. But I pick and choose what to respond to. If I’m feeling really fragile that day I’ll just say to myself, I haven’t got the energy for this fight.”A recent post on Hussain’s Instagram showed her in a towelling robe, recovering from a panic attack – her husband had washed her, and put her to bed. That was not a night for Twitter. “But I’m really aware of the fact that my kids are getting closer to becoming teenagers, so it’s not going to be long before they’re going to be on social media. And it’s going to be really hard for them to watch someone say something to their mum. But I want to balance the scales, so I’ll try and turn my response into a positive, because I don’t want them to look back and think, ‘God, Mum’s not a very nice person.’”Every choice she makes is with her children in mind, and every conversation starts and ends with them, like internal punctuation. About six months after Hussain won Bake Off, with a lemon drizzle cake stuck with jewels and a red, white and blue sari, somebody asked her son what her mum did, that housewife conversation again. He thought about it for a minute, she says, mimicking his head falling to the side. “And then he said: ‘I know. She lives her dreams. That’s what she does.’” Grinning, she clasps her hands together, but rather than holding them over her heart, she puts them to her belly, as if he’s fed her the most beautiful meal.Nadiya Hussain’s homeware range is available at nadiyahussain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5ff0a3cdd10f890e3bb71153f68219b4b2f47a8/0_101_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c1d30d71aeb55ec34c965117ff6e41e","title":"football dire jose mourinho enjoying it","story":"Romelu Lukaku is another clearly struggling under the regime at Manchester United, with no sign of improvement in sightWith 10 minutes left at Anfield Romelu Lukaku set off on a dummy run towards the touchline, then turned to take the ball back from the player he imagined to be standing behind him. Except that player was Virgil van Dijk, who plays for Liverpool.Lukaku stopped, looked baffled, almost seemed ready to scratch his head. They say the best players carry a picture around with them, a flashing radar screen of every other moving part on the pitch. On a cold, wet, merciless day at Anfield Lukaku seemed to be carrying a picture of something else altogether, a game of noughts and crosses perhaps or a hastily sketched pencil drawing of a hamster.In the first half he completed one pass. He made one fine run down the flank to help set up United’s equaliser. Otherwise Lukaku was a No 9-shaped absence. Often the ball just seemed like an irritation, a side issue as he got on with the wider task of repeatedly bouncing off Van Dijk like a fly banging its head against a window pane.And yet, while he was bad here, and has been bad for weeks, Lukaku is not the problem with this team. Like so many elements associated with Manchester United he has simply been deflated, all sense of joy and zest sucked from his game by the anti-chemistry of this grey regime, a player who has gained nothing, learned nothing, gone nowhere.“Don’t sack Mourinho, don’t sack Mourinho” – by the end this was almost too much for the Anfield crowd, left drowning in honey by a late-breaking 3-1 win that returned Liverpool to the top of the table, left United’s season looking beached and provided another near death-blow for a manager who had haunted this stadium ever since the last time Liverpool fancied themselves title contenders four years go, Demba Ba and all that.They will not sack Mourinho, not yet. That new contract will need paying up. Plus there is nowhere to go at this stage of the season, no obvious remedy, not least when the entire club seems shot through with a sickness of the spirit that goes well beyond the head coach.Liverpool are of course the main story here. Jürgen Klopp’s team were overwhelmingly superior. They had 36 shots at goal. They might have won by five goals. Klopp made a perfectly judged substitution, bringing on Xherdan Shaqiri to take the game away. But still, somehow, Liverpool’s excellence was overshadowed by the sheer barren awfulness of their opponents.This was beyond dire – dire squared, dire football played in dire fashion by a dire selection. Imagine a bad plan, enacted badly, by someone not very good at enacting bad plans. Imagine a negative approach, applied with extreme negativity by a group of players feeling negative about the actual merits of all this negativity. Why would anyone want to keep doing this? Is Mourinho enjoying it? Even United’s starting XI was a deathly thing with seven of the 10 starting outfield players either defenders or defensive midfieldersAnd from the start Liverpool tore into those deep blue-grey shirts. Eric Bailly’s first significant act was to come charging forward out of defence and perform a kind of rugby spear-tackle on Firmino. For a while United looked like a massively hung-over pub team startled to find itself facing a group of peak-condition professionals. What’s the point of picking a tough, battling, muscular team if they get out-battled, out-muscled and out-toughed?The goal was coming. You could hear it approaching, bells jingling, footsteps crunching across the corrugated roof. It arrived after Bailly had done something extraordinary, barrelling out of defence again like lane three at the world 60 metres championships. This time he reached the Liverpool half before hurling himself on to his back. Liverpool foraged down the left and moments later Fabinho played a dreamy pass over the top for Sadio Mané to finish neatly. A José Mourinho team that can’t defend: what, exactly, is the point of this?Meanwhile Lukaku continued to fret. Each time the ball approached he looked startled, waving a leg, running the other way, like a cat startled by a remote controlled toy on Christmas Day. But he was there to spin and sprint down the left flank and set up a close-range finish for Jesse Lingard on 33 minutes.For long periods the second half was a neck-cricking affair, all 20 outfield players dragged towards the United goal like snooker balls on a wonky table. United’s best attacking player, Anthony Martial, came on with 12 minutes to go. It seemed fitting the goal that re-established Liverpool’s lead should come with the help of four deflections and Shaqiri’s decisive third via another.Liverpool march on and will now face a vital couple of weeks in their pursuit of the league title.

Fill in your own jokes here. Or consider, perhaps, the gloating cries of “Don’t sack Mourinho”, heavy on irony, from Liverpool’s supporters on the day Jürgen Klopp’s team seized back control of a title race where their arch-rivals are barely even an afterthought.For all the historic rivalry of this fixture it is the other team from along the East Lancs Road that should be uppermost in Liverpool’s thoughts now. Liverpool versus Manchester City is what matters. And United? They are just a memory. Mourinho’s team have conceded more goals in mid-December than they did throughout the whole of last season. They are 19 points off the top and one statistic in particular stood out: 36 shots for Liverpool, their most in any league fixture for two years. It could be years before United are title challengers again and, for a club with their ambitions, who could be surprised if the manager pays the price with his job? At any of his previous clubs it would probably have happened already.One certainty: Liverpool will enjoy rubbernecking in United’s direction. The league leaders were fortunate in one respect, that Xherdan Shaqiri’s second-half goals both took deflections before beating David de Gea in United’s goal.Overall, however, who could say they were lucky given the balance of play, the long spells when they pinned their opponents back and the clear suspicion that, but for a dreadful mistake from Alisson, Liverpool’s goalkeeper, it would have been an even more straightforward victory?Liverpool were winning 1-0, courtesy of Sadio Mané, before Alisson’s faux pas allowed Jesse Lingard to steal in for an equaliser that changed the complexion of the game. At 1-1 there was a considerable period when Liverpool looked unusually short of ideas. But it was an adventurous move from Klopp to replace Naby Keïta with Shaqiri in the 70th minute. The substitute scored twice within 10 minutes and Mourinho had to spend the remainder of the game listening to the crowd’s schadenfreude, with Ed Woodward, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Alex Ferguson watching on from the stands. It is the worst points total for United at this stage of a season for 26 years – worse than anything that happened under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.If one is going to be generous, the issue was not whether Mourinho’s players were trying their hardest. The problem boiled down to something else: an imbalance of talent. Pep Guardiola made this point when City visited Anfield earlier in the season: Liverpool can swamp opponents when the game is this frenetic. And, for United, it was a dizzying blur at times, particularly in those frantic early exchanges when there was barely time to analyse some of the incidents. The saves from De Gea, the penalty-box pinball, the goal-line clearance from Ashley Young, the shots that flew left, right and high of the United goal.After 19 minutes there had been 10 scoring attempts, nine for Liverpool. De Gea could be seen pleading with his team-mates to calm down. But the visiting players were rushing their passes, falling into the trap, making it the game Liverpool wanted it to be and, five minutes later, the pass Fabinho clipped into the penalty area was weighted beautifully to find Mané. Young had let him go and Mané took his goal with such expertise, controlling the ball on his chest and volleying a left-foot shot past De Gea, it felt barely conceivable to remember all those chances he passed up in Liverpool’s previous game against Napoli.If Liverpool had kept a clean sheet, they would have established a record for the 17-game mark of the Premier League era. Instead Alisson contrived to present Lingard with an equaliser wrapped in red ribbon. The goalkeeper had both hands on the ball when he went down to collect Romelu Lukaku’s waist-high cross. What he could not do was get a firm grip of it and suddenly the ball had squirted free. Lingard was sliding in. The ball was scuffed into the net and the nearest defender, Virgil van Dijk, was doubled over in shock, both hands covering his face.It took a while for Liverpool to shake their heads clear and for 20 minutes in the second half there was a hint of desperation to their play, with Nathaniel Clyne, then Dejan Lovren and Van Dijk all taking aim from long distance. Again Klopp’s team were pushing their opponents back but their decision-making was erratic and it was difficult to get through all the congestion in United’s penalty area. At one point Mohamed Salah even miscued a corner and a huge sigh reverberated off the Kop.Shaqiri’s arrival added another penetrative player to Liverpool’s attack and that was decisive. His first goal skimmed in off Young, via the underside of the crossbar, after Mané had beaten Ander Herrera to create the danger. Shaqiri’s next one flicked off Eric Bailly to fly past De Gea from just outside the penalty area and, amid all the drama, a penny for Paul Pogba’s thoughts? Once again there was no place for Pogba in Mourinho’s line-up and, when United needed some inspiration, their World Cup winner remained on the bench.It finished with Klopp pumping his fists on the pitch, United 11 points off the top four and Mourinho sounding increasingly desperate. Liverpool, holding off the champions at the top of the table, can forget United now and that, more than anything, shows the different directions in which these clubs are travelling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce683a71e61a418f22209b230aedd0c336735a9/427_0_7829_4697/master/7829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22fc080abbd975386ce388a81179a4a5","title":"head in the clouds climate change nalini nadkarni costa rica monteverde","story":"For four decades, Nalini Nadkarni has studied cloud forest in the Costa Rican town of Monteverde. In that time, global warming has wrought big changes – and now threatens to dry out the area’s lush hanging gardens for goodby  Peter Beaumont images by  Christian SinibaldiNalini Nadkarni is sitting with her notebook and tape measure near the top of a strangler fig in Costa Rica’s Monteverde forest, on a branch 35 metres above the ground that is almost broad enough to walk along.Attached to the rope she has climbed to reach her perch, she squats among mosses, orchids and other plants that grow thickly on the bark, giving the canopy the impression of a hanging garden.Known as epiphytes – plants that grow on other plants – they are Nadkarni’s special field of scientific research, omnipresent in the unique ecosystem of Costa Rica’s montane cloud forest. They thrive between 1,500 and 1,800 metres and depend on their ability to take water and nutrients directly from the swirling mists that should cloak these slopes.But the continued existence of the cloud forest in Monteverde, familiar to the millions of tourists who have visited it, is under threat from global warming.Only occurring in a narrow altitude band whose upper limit is defined by where the mountain tops run out and by the altitude at which the trees can grow, it is being squeezed in a vice from below by warmer and drier weather patterns eradicating the enfolding cloud.Amphibians that once lived here have died back, to the point of species extinction in some cases.The breeding patterns of the area’s emblematic resplendent quetzals – the colourful birds that have long drawn tourists to the area – are being disrupted. Lowland species of bats and birds, including toucans, have begun moving into the cloud forest.One of the Costa Rica cloud forest’s most persistent and high-profile champions, Nadkarni has become increasingly concerned about the forest’s future.A 64-year-old American scientist who has spent almost 40 years climbing ropes to study the forest canopy, she has seen profound changes in the decades she has spent studying the Monteverde forest.“Its most important aspect is the fact that it gets a lot of mist and cloud during most of the year. What’s fabulous about it is that it really nurtures this incredibly erse and abundant group of plants that live in the canopy, which obtain their water and their nutrients from this mist and cloud.“When I climb into the forest, when I get away from the dark, damp, windless forest floor – well, you really enter kind of a different world.”Nadkarni identifies the montane cloud forest as one of the world’s three most sensitive along with the threatened coral reefs and ice caps.“It is one of the canaries in the coal mine, more sensitive to climate change than others. All are indicative of a world that is experiencing climate change and that’s happening now.”Nadkarni is not wrong. Once inside, the forest is a dark and dripping place at ground level, its perspectives shifting spookily with the passage of the mists across the rise of the continental ide.Punctuating the green curtain are flashes of colour.Subtle mauve bells of drymonia compete with the spiky balls of yellow justicia and the blades of vibrant red that attract butterflies and other insects.There are sloths and monkeys in the branches, while coatis and agoutis scamper in the undergrowth.But it is the trees that are most striking, not least the towering strangler figs with trunks like church buttresses.The sheer scale of the ersity is explained by another facet of this ecosystem: the compression of multiple “life zones” into the narrow band of the cloud forest supports huge numbers of species, many still to be identified.Following Nadkarni and her colleague Cameron Williams 30m up a free hanging rope into the branches, it is hard to credit that her passion for the forest tops almost killed her three years ago. Then, climbing in a forest in the American Pacific north-west, a rope severed, precipitating a 15-metre ground fall.“You know I’ve climbed for 39 years and never had a problem. I always felt that if we take care with our equipment – with our process or protocols – that trees actually are one of the safest places to be.“But three years ago, in the temperate rainforest of the Olympic Peninsula, my rope failed. My graduate students said that I didn’t utter a scream. I just fell like a silent sack of sand. I was knocked out for 10 minutes and I was on the forest floor for about six hours before the helicopter came.”The injuries would have stopped most people of 61.Five thoracic vertebrae were “exploded”. She lost her spleen as well, and her pelvis was broken in three places she suffered nine broken ribs, lacerated lungs and a broken fibula. “I was in bad shape.”And Nadkarni sees her accident as a metaphor for the threat to the cloud forest.“I think that fall from a tree made me realise how fragile the human body is. By extension it relates to what I’m trying to do in understanding and communicating the importance of forests.“You can walk into a forest that seems so robust and so healthy and so erse and so connected and so strong and so useful and so beautiful. Just like I was – I was robust, I was vibrant, I could climb to the top of any tree.”Because one of the paradoxes of the cloud forest, even under threat, is that it still looks vibrant even as new species move in, undermining its uniqueness.In the research centre at the Monteverde cloud forest reserve, Nadkarni’s fellow scientist Alan Pounds, one of the first people to warn of the threat to the cloud forest from the lifting cloud base in the 1990s, explains that it is not simply a question of the cloud rising.Instead the weather appears to be in the midst of a complex, wholesale change that has seen dry days in the forest quadruple in the last four decades. That has also been accompanied by more extreme rainfall, including flash-flooding.“What we’re teasing out in our analysis is the fact that it’s getting wetter and drier at the same time,” he says, explaining how the persistent mist has given way to drier periods, punctuated by heavy episodes of rain.“Actually it’s becoming more like a rainforest. We just have more contrast between wet and dry periods.”Among species challenged by these changes, Pounds – like many the  talks to – mentions the resplendent quetzal which comes to breed in the cloud forest, feeding on a kind of small avocado.“It’s a good example of what we are talking about when we say it is getting squeezed because there’s no place for it to go upslope.Pounds mentions a nearby area of woods. “I used to hear them singing every day during breeding season and now they’ve moved out of that area and they’ve become more restricted, moving higher up the mountain here.”What is doubly ironic, given the threat, is that the community in Monteverde has long been ahead of the curve in terms of conservation efforts, in part the result of a historical coincidence.One key element was the arrival in the 1950s of US Quakers – pacifists – who emigrated to the area fleeing the draft for the Korean war.While these new residents cleared forest for pastures for dairy farming, they protected parts of the forest to conserve the watershed. In the 1970s, as recognition of the uniqueness of the infrastructure grew, Quakers, incoming scientists and local Costa Ricans formed an informal coalition that has continued to this day as ecotourism emerged as an economic mainstay.But if there is a catch, it is that on an isthmus bounded by warming oceans on two sides – the Atlantic on the Caribbean side and the Pacific on the other – it has been impossible to insulate the cloud forest from what is a worldwide phenomenon.And the impact of global warming has been noticed not only in the forest but in the coffee plantations at its edges.On his plantation, Guillermo Vargas, who doubles as the head of the local tourism council, has seen the mountains transform in his 58 years.“It’s been over the last 30 that we have noticed the change in the precipitation,” he says.“Now it is raining differently. It rains very hard so it impacts the soil, causing more erosion.“Also, the fact that the wet and dry seasons are now not very well defined means that the coffee blooms in January through June. In the past the bloom was concentrated in a period of maybe four or five weeks in the beginning of May, June.”That, says Vargas, has caused economic issues both for farmers and the pickers, including those who come from Nicaragua, who need to come for longer but with fewer coffee beans per day to pick, as the period of the harvest has become much more spread out.Another issue, he adds, is that pests once just seen in Costa Rica’s lowlands have begun appearing at ever higher elevations.It is not only the impact on coffee he is worried about but ultimately on the ecotourism that sustains many of the jobs in the local community.“I know that for more than 40 years we have said we are the most famous cloud forest in the world. That this is unique in Costa Rica.All of which means, says Vargas, that the ecotourism industry – which the community has built from a base of 15,000 visitors a year to almost 200,000 – will also have to adapt to climate change.“The fact that the cloud forest is changing means we have to adapt in terms of the story we tell, to be able to understand the process, and then explain to visitors about the process and still be able to demonstrate that Monteverde is a unique destination not just because of the cloud forest but because of our capacity to teach about climate change.Down from the tops of the swaying strangler figs and on solid ground again, Nalini Nadkarni reflects on how the threat of climate change to the place where she has worked for four decades has transformed her in recent years from a scientific researcher into something more activist.“You know when I first came here in 1979 as a graduate student and I looked up into the canopy of this Monteverde cloud forest and I saw these plants and animals high above the forest floor, I was just curious about what is going on. I wanted to find out about what’s going on with these canopy plants.“But just 15 years ago I was up in a tree and I heard the sound of a chainsaw just outside the boundary of the Monteverde cloud forest, and I realised in an almost metaphorical way that in fact deforestation, human activities and their negative effects were literally right outside the border of this beautiful little reserve.”It is an issue, she concedes, that has become even more pressing in the Trump era, where climate change denial has been embraced by the White House.“As an American and as a scientist I am horrified. I am ashamed. I actually feel like going into denial about my own country in terms of its response to global climate change.“All of us scientists, not just in America but around the world, know that climate change is being exacerbated. Being caused by human activities, by overconsumption, by use of fossil fuels. And for our leadership to take exactly the wrong turn, to remove ourselves from the Paris treaty, to encourage coal mining …“What I feel I need to do is to bring my science, bring my understanding of what’s going on in the tropical cloud forest and other ecosystems to the people, to policymakers.“I think that scientists are becoming more political. We have become less afraid to speak out against the political regimes that are making these wrong decisions. In the past, even ten years ago, my fellow scientists would not be making these statements.”Nadkarni reflects on the change. “You know each species that moves or disappears has repercussions in terms of the ecosystem as a whole. Now the plants are a little bit harder to see. But I know when I climb in the forest, that compared with when I started here 39 years ago, the canopy dwelling plants – the mosses, the filmy ferns – they were much more abundant, much more plush, much more … just wet, than they are now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57c25bb419f90ff6f23e07c380204577984d0ce2/2_0_8723_5236/master/8723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d9bf7db63ab782f125d4f4377f6ffe","title":"bolognese and bonding why i love cooking with my children","story":"With smart appliances like the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, getting your kids to help out in the kitchen is easier than ever. Mum-of-three Antonia Windsor explains why cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity for bonding, belly laughs and some stealth mathsBy the time my middle child Ziggy, now five, was just nine months old he had already joined me in the kitchen. He would sit on the floor with pans while I threw down the potato peelings for him to stir and spoon. I loved this bonding time with him, and proudly posted pictures of him on social media: my chef in the making. My two-year-old Zenya is following in his footsteps, often by my side while I’m chopping, offering up plates of pretend pizza for me to mime eating or cups of imaginary hot chocolate to sip.My eldest, Zayla, who is now six, had less interest in pretend cooking, but as soon as she could mix real flour in a bowl with real milk and crack an egg into it she was desperate for us to make pancakes on a weekly basis.I began to love and dread with equal measure the unfolding of the aprons, knowing that my kitchen would be chaos in just a few short minutes, but knowing, too, that there would be belly laughs and bonding that no other activity quite reproduces.Not only is cooking a fun, sensory activity for children it is also a great way for children to develop pride and confidence in their abilities. To create something from raw ingredients and actually get to eat the end product gives children a great sense of satisfaction.It is also a great way for small children to develop fine motor skills. Chopping, mixing, spreading and spooning are all actions that help develop hand-eye coordination and build strength in little fingers. As children get older they can start to read recipes for themselves and learn about weights and measures, turning family cooking into an easy educational activity that the children don’t need a spoonful of sugar to swallow. If I want to make our cooking a little more challenging mathematically, I double the quantities in a recipe and ask the children to help with the calculations. I also find it’s an easy way to help them understand concepts such as fractions - particularly when cutting a homemade cake into slices.If you are looking for inspiration on what to cook with the family, smart kitchen technology can really help you out the Samsung Family Hub™ fridge, for instance, can suggest child-friendly recipes based on the ingredients you already have in stock. We’re all big fans of the CBeebies programme I Can Cook, which has a fabulous range of multicultural recipes that are simple for children to make, and the Samsung Family Hub™ can help out here too – you can stream TV* to the built-in screen from your smartphone**.I find that when we make things ourselves from scratch it is easier to slip in healthy ingredients. Now, when we make pancakes, I slip in chia seeds and linseed, almond flour and coconut sugar. The children are happy because there are more ingredients to mix in the bowl, and they eat their creations hungrily, having hovered at the pan as I fry each one, desperate for their first taste.Now my children are old enough, we have progressed from pancakes and biscuits to them helping with dinner preparation. The children use butter knives to chop mushrooms for bolognese sauce, or help with the mashing of potato for shepherd’s pie.I talk to them as we cook. I tell them about ingredients, about where they come from and when they are in season, and I share family history, describing the food my husband’s mother prepares in Zimbabwe and the French-influenced dishes that my mum and gran cooked for me during my childhood in Jersey. In this way, I hope that our cooking together is a way that I can pass on traditions and family recipes, and help my children to grow into confident cooks who can pass these traditions down to their own children.* Service available on the Samsung Smart TV 6400 series and above, released in 2015** Requires Samsung Galaxy S6 and above or Samsung Galaxy Note 5, 7, 8 and 9 seriesDiscover how the Samsung Family Hub™ can help make your kitchen a more enjoyable place for all your family at samsungukfamilyhub"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93604f10c4d9f0a2009c4a7c265eb0da85331df2/0_146_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14ce655377b2673052039cc7196c6272","title":"workers get new rights in overhaul but zero hours contracts remain","story":"Measures include protections for agency workers and heavier fines for malicious employees The government has introduced what it claims to be the biggest package of workplace reforms for 20 years after concerns that ministers have failed to appeal to voters who are “just about managing”.Legislation that comes into effect on Monday will increase fines for employers who have deliberately victimised their staff, and give workers details of their rights from the first day in their job.The reforms, outlined by the business secretary Greg Clark, plan to stop the “unfair” use of pay-between-assignment contracts which allow businesses to opt out of equal pay arrangements for agency employees. Measures will also be taken to ensure that seasonal workers get the paid time off they are entitled to.The reforms will be seen as a direct appeal to Labour voters and an attempt to get back to the values expressed by Theresa May in July 2016. In her first speech as prime minister, May said: “If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security.” She pledged to protect those who were “just about managing”.Labour has questioned whether the plans will do anything for people on zero-hours contracts. Unions said the reforms were a missed opportunity to rebalance power in the gig economy.The reforms, covered in a report called the Good Work Plan, are based on the recommendations made by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor in his review into employment, especially in the so-called gig economy. The government has pledged to implement 51 of Taylor’s suggested 53 reforms.Legislation will be introduced to give workers details of their rights from the first day in a job, such as eligibility for sick leave, pay levels, maternity and paternity leave.The maximum employment tribunal fines for employers demonstrated to have shown malice, spite or gross oversight will increase from £5,000 to £20,000.Ministers are also committing to legislate to improve employment status tests to “reflect the reality of the modern working relationships”. Despite calls from unions, the government said the reforms would not ban zero-hours contracts, in keeping with Taylor’s recommendations, because that would “negatively impact” more people than it helped.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed some reforms such as the decision to scrap the so-called “agency worker loophole”.However, Grady said the government had missed an opportunity to bolster the rights of zero-hours workers. “These reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy. Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.“The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist,” she said.Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary, said the reforms will do little to combat the government’s attacks on workers’ rights such as an increase in employment tribunal fees, the Trade Union Act and low wage growth.“These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers,” she said.The government claims the reforms will make the UK the first country in the world to address the opportunities and challenges of the gig economy and its impact on a modern economy.They form a key part of the government’s modern industrial strategy, a long-term plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.Clark said: “The world of work is changing, bringing new opportunities for innovative businesses and new business models to flourish, creating jobs across the country and boosting our economy.“Today’s largest upgrade in workers’ rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.”Taylor told the : “I think this is a welcome and substantive response from the government and will make a real difference to the working lives of millions of workers, particularly those in the most vulnerable positions.”One business representative broadly welcomed the suggested reforms. Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “Businesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and it’s right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society.“They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.“However, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

Here’s how to squeeze it in, whatever your schedule“Some people think if they can’t fit in a 60-minute gym routine, there’s no point,” says Steve Kamb, a fitness instructor and the founder of the training website NerdFitness. But, for many people, it takes a lot of courage just to get through the door to go for that first run. Giving yourself 20 seconds to be brave is a great stepping stone. Use it to Google a workout plan, or even just to walk into the gym and straight back out again, suggests Kamb. “It doesn’t matter if you finish the task just yet. Sometimes getting into the gym in the first place is the victory.”Planking engages a number of muscles in the shoulders, back and stomach. Achieving a non-stop 30-second plank is harder than it looks, but planking helps to build a stronger core and improve posture and even flexibility. Muscle burns more calories than fat, so planking can help you to burn more calories even when you are not working out.A couple of BuzzFeed writers who resolved to plank every day for 30 days, building up to a plank of two minutes, saw improvements in muscle definition by the end of their trial.Sprinting for as little as a minute each day can reduce body fat, build muscle and increase the rate at which your body burns calories while resting. Marathon runners regularly incorporate short bursts of sprinting into training, as in the Swedish technique fartlek, because it drastically improves speed and cardiovascular fitness so that people can exercise longer. Sprints should be broken into 20-second bursts, so that you are working flat out. One study of obese men showed that they improved leg power and oxygen uptake in only two weeks.Another found that one minute of sprint interval training, three times a week, had the same health benefits as 50 minutes of continuous moderate exercise, despite a five-fold lower time commitment (when taking into account the warm-up and cool-down). It is also one of the best abdominal workouts you can do – raising your leg at the 45-degree angle required for a proper sprint is equivalent to doing a crunch, and sprinters repeat this movement about 60 times in a 100-metre sprint.If your goal is to one day do a pull up, starting with your grip strength could be an idea, because it is what determines whether you fall off the bar. “There’s nothing to stop you from picking up dumbells and going for a walk,” says Kamb. He suggests carrying them like suitcases at your side, an exercise known as “the farmer carry”. Each week your grip strength will get a little better.A four-minute workout could help you to silence the voice in your head that says: “I don’t want to work out.” Tabata workouts are made up of 20-second intervals of intense exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated eight times, totalling four minutes. “Often when people miss one workout, they feel they’ve lost all their gains. Tabata keeps up momentum and will sustain your muscle growth even when you can’t make it to the gym,” says Kamb.Get ready for tomorrow’s workout tonight. “Put your alarm clock against the other side of the room, a glass of water by your bed, sleep in your gym kit and put your shoes by your bed,” says Kamb. His reasoning? Everyone wants to be as lazy as possible when it comes to exercising – if you are already in your workout clothes when you wake up, you have eliminated a major hurdle.But make sure you walk up – not down, he says: “We did a study where we put signs up saying ‘Take the stairs’ – but people just walked down. That defeats the point – climbing stairs is two to three times more strenuous.” Research has shown the health benefits for sedentary people of climbing 13 floors a day. Eves suggests spreading them throughout the day, at home or in coffee breaks at work.Get off the bus or train a stop early and walk home. Researchers from Sheffield Hallam university looked into the benefits of walking for 30 minutes a day in three 10-minute bursts, compared with people fitting in the often recommended 10,000 steps a day. The 3,000-step walkers fared better. The researchers put this down to the intensity of the walks – so make sure your walk home is a brisk one.“Low-intensity steady state” cardio exercise (Liss) is essentially the opposite of high-intensity interval training (Hiit). It has cardiovascular benefits, as well as increasing and strengthening the legs. The advantange over Hiit is that you can do it for longer.Health is as much about what you put in your mouth as it is how you move. Batch-cook your lunches for the coming week if you want to get ahead – when you are not hungry or rushed you will make healthier choices.This is enough time to complete the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme for absolute beginner runners. The programme builds up from walking to running 3.1 miles through three structured commitments a week and comes with a great podcast to keep you going.It is often said it takes 21 days to form a habit. In fact, researchers at University College London who studied habit formation found that the average time for behaviour to become automatic was 66 days. If you want to improve your health, whether by drinking more water or eating a piece of fruit at lunch, try to stick with it for more than two months.If applicable, quit smoking. Your lung capacity is a key part of exercising, as is your heart function and the transportation of oxygen through your blood – all of which are affected by smoking. It may take time – some research says quitters try an average of 30 times before stopping successfully – but it will be worth it. The risk of heart disease halves after a year without smoking and your lung function will improve, too.

My Brexit deal is falling apart, I almost got voted out and no one in the world likes me at all. But it’s still Christmas, so let’s try to have some cheer tonight, shall we?” she says.She introduces a high-foreheaded and relaxed-looking David Cameron, played by Matt Damon, as “the man who called for the Brexit vote – then, when it passed, he bounced and left me to clean up his mess.”“You look well rested,” says May, and Cameron tells her he has just returned from a relaxing holiday in the Males.“You know what’s funny?” he says. “People hate me, but they really hate you. Even though I did Brexit. I mean, you’ve got to laugh.”The pair are then joined by Elton John, played by Aidy Bryant, who delivers a hamper of presents that all turn out to be faeces, and by Voldemort, “the one person in Britain more reviled than me”.McKinnon, who has impersonated Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber and Angela Merkel on the show, spoke to the  last year about her uncanny impression of May.“There’s a lot of things about her I found … endearing,” she said. “I found her cheerful, from afar. I don’t live there, so I’m not completely immersed in the nuances of the politics of the UK.

Nevertheless, it soon became evident that my relationship with him would not be the usual type of supervisor-student relationship. In those days, before he had his entourage of nurses and assistants, students would necessarily have to help him in various ways on account of his disability. This was not an arduous task, but it did mean that my relationship with him became quite intimate. Indeed, I shared an office with him, lived with his family for a while and accompanied him as he travelled around the world, giving talks and collecting medals.I soon discovered some of Stephen’s singular characteristics. The first, of course, was that he was very smart. Students are probably always in awe of their supervisors and with Stephen the awe was even greater. Indeed, on matters of physics, I always regarded him as an oracle, just a few words from him yielding insights that would have taken weeks to work out on my own. However, Stephen was only human and not all encounters led to illumination. Once I asked a question about something that was puzzling me. He thought about it silently for several minutes and I was quite impressed with myself for asking something that Stephen couldn’t answer immediately. His eyes then closed and I was even more impressed with myself because he was clearly having to think about it very deeply. Only after some time did it become clear that he had fallen asleep. Nowadays, I also sometimes fall asleep while talking to students, so I recall this incident with amusement.The other human side of Stephen is that he didn’t suffer fools gladly and sometimes got annoyed. One of the stories put around is that he would vent his frustration by running over students’ toes. I’m not sure about that – he once ran over the toes of the Prince of Wales, and I’m sure that was just an accident. On the other hand, I well recall one occasion when I made a remark in the departmental common room at tea time that showed I had misunderstood what he’d been saying. Stephen screamed “No!” so loudly that his wheelchair shot back halfway across the room under the recoil. I was most impressed that a single word from him could have such dramatic consequences.I also learned about Stephen’s stubbornness and determination to continue doing things for himself as long as possible, despite the relentless progress of his illness. For example, because he had an office in both the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics and the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge, I also had offices in both places. I recall that he sometimes gave me a lift (probably illegally!) between the two places in his three-wheeled invalid car. I found this rather scary because I thought he drove faster than was safe. Later, he had to discontinue the use of the car but he never lost his drive and the desire to travel as far and wide as possible. One regret is he didn’t live long enough to achieve his dream of going into space.I’m often asked where Stephen stands in the pantheon of great physicists. There are many ways of being a great physicist and they cannot be ranked like runners in an Olympic race. Stephen himself never claimed to have the status of Newton or Einstein, but I strongly disagree with people who suggest that his scientific contributions have been exaggerated because of his iconic status. His disability was clearly a factor in his becoming so famous, but I doubt any other contemporary physicist will achieve the accolade of being interred next to Isaac Newton in Westminster Abbey.Stephen died on Einstein’s birthday and was born on the date of Galileo’s death, so it’s odd that he should be connected to his two greatest heroes in this way. I doubt Stephen would have attributed much significance to this, but he would certainly acknowledge that we don’t understand the mystery of time. In any case, the synchronicity is fitting because his first major discovery was that spacetime trajectories can have singular endpoints where strange things may happen. Stephen was the most singular person I have ever known and I feel truly privileged that he was my friend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a80c952590967246aff9c29542272d22dcd24579/94_216_4391_2635/master/4391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=664747f4efb958d7f6c97e37ae2954cf","title":"faith lost if adopt technology amish resist modern world","story":"Theirs is a traditional life of faith, family and work, without cars or smartphones – and their community is growingDaniel Weaver does not vote, drive a car, read a paper, listen to music, watch sport of any kind, own a mobile phone or use a computer. But as we eat the food grown in his garden outside the window, he confesses that he did once see a film. He refuses to disclose what, brushing aside my questions as we sit talking around the dining table with his wife, five of his eight children and one grandson. “I am not proud of that,” he says. “I went against my parents’ wishes.”But this one-off incident, many years ago, speaks to the reasons why this 52-year-old sold his thriving Ohio clothing business, one that supplied hundreds of stores across North America, and moved his family to this idyllic farm in upstate New York three years ago. Daniel is Amish – a member of a community famed worldwide for their plain clothes and use of horse-drawn buggies – and he fears the impact of modernity and the temptations of technology on his children, his church and his traditional Christian world. “Our values are different and we chose to safeguard them,” he says. “But if our people get lax and rub elbows too much with the world, then the world may not look too different – we become like the people outside.”Instead, he has returned to the Amish tradition of farming, enjoying a homespun lifestyle that eschews things the rest of us take for granted – from televisions to trouser belts, in case they distract from a devotion to God. This German-speaking sect, which demands simple lives of self-reliance based on the Bible, may be at odds with the rest of today’s society – yet surprisingly, it is booming, rather than being swamped by a fast-evolving world of smartphones and social media.In 1989, there were some 100,000 Amish scattered in 179 settlements across North America. Recent analysis by academics at Elizabethtown College, Pennsylvania found numbers have surged to 330,265 Amish in 546 settlements. It is the fastest-growing faith group on the continent, with predictions that there might be more than 1 million adherents by 2050. This marks an extraordinary turnaround: there were only 5,000 Amish in America a century ago.Perhaps most remarkably, the reason for this population explosion is not just the traditional big Amish families. Children are actively choosing to stay in communities, resisting the lure of clubs, sport, music and technology. “I’ve heard a lot about Facebook, but it seems a waste of time,” says Michael, 15, one of Daniel’s four sons, over fresh tomato soup. “I can be doing things a lot more beneficial than going to bars or spending time looking at a phone.” Children can choose to be baptised into the church in their late teens – and researchers say retention rates appear to have risen in recent decades.It is not just computers and cars that families turn their backs on. Many Amish reject mains electricity and some refuse indoor plumbing, while wives must follow the decisions of their husbands orce is an impermissible sin. Children carry out chores from infancy. Yet behind those distinctive long beards for men and white bonnets for women, there are some smart business brains, with soaring numbers of multimillionaires. I speak to one man running a firm with 500 employees that he started aged 50 in his barn, while others have become wealthy from land ownership as their population expands, driving up land values.Most Amish people live in small communities of about 20 households, clustered around churches that set their own rules they can now be found in 30 states, as well as Canada, Argentina and Bolivia. “When you have families of 13 people and most stay with the faith, then you end up with lots of people,” says Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor and author of books on the Amish (though she is not Amish herself). “For the most part, I have seen shared labour and a sense of working together that we do not have any more. What I have always most admired is the strength of their families.”A range of factors, from ending the draft in 1973, which forced young Amish men (as conscientious objectors) to carry out community work, through to a more recent trend towards educating Amish children in their own schools, has meant less interaction with the outside world. This has reinforced a sense of separatism and fuelled higher retention rates than in the years before the second world war, when differences with wider society were less stark.New York’s Amish community is among the fastest-growing, with 58 settlements, mainly in the north of the state. Settlers are lured by land cheaper than in the Amish heartlands of Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania – the photogenic backdrop for the film Witness, starring Harrison Ford as a police officer hiding in the community. In the small market town of Morris, where the Weavers now live, there are seven Amish households in an area that has seen scores of small farms go out of business.But their neighbours seem to welcome them, not least because they have revived derelict farms. “They are well liked here,” says Leslie Stroh, a publisher who worked on Daniel’s fields as a boy. “They don’t integrate, and why should they? But they are still very open to us.” There have been tensions in other places, however, over issues such as horse droppings on roads, and refusing to install hazard lights on buggies.Stopping in the centre of this quiet town, I meet an elderly Amish man visiting the post office on his bicycle, who turns out to be Daniel’s father, Roy. A widower who moved here a year ago, following his son, he politely answers my questions and talks me through some of the Amish community’s basic beliefs – about following “the old ways” as set out in the Bible. Later I learn the family was driven to move by cheaper land, tensions over technology in their previous church, and Daniel’s desire to spend more time with his family. He is building a store to sell local produce, while Sam, his eldest son, runs a dairy farm.That evening, Daniel asks me to join his household for dinner, an unusual invitation. But the meal is punctuated by laughter, as the Weavers describe a way of life that revolves around faith, family and work. “I feel you can be trusted, so you are sitting at my table,” Daniel says. “But on a friendship level, our values are very different. We would not want to mix with you, because if our children came to your home, they might sit and watch television.”We discuss their attitudes to issues such as girls’ and women’s rights, the conversation carrying on into the following day. “The Bible says a husband must love his wife and if a wife follows his lead then you will have a happy family,” says Sam, 28, a father of four. “If God’s ways are followed, then a contented family will result under our culture.” When I press him on the fairness of this, he argues they are all – men and women alike – following ine command. While the family insist all key decisions are shared, it is noticeable that the women are reticent in these male-dominated discussions. They are also more likely to carry out the traditional tasks of cleaning and cooking. Ira, Daniel’s wife, describes her day to me: “quiet time praying”, then “the girls help with breakfast and we are done by seven so the men can go out.” Her husband tells me Ira is not a “women’s libber”.The couple’s lively one-year-old grandson, Nathan, joins us at the table, along with his father, Josh. His wife – Daniel and Ira’s oldest daughter – died of Hodgkin lymphoma when she was just 23, soon after the boy’s birth. They tell me this was deeply painful and that they miss her profoundly, but believe there is a higher purpose to such loss. “To us, death is not God’s punishment. God is in control of life and death,” Daniel says.The Amish are followers of Jacob Amman, a hardline Swiss bishop who broke with the Mennonite faith in 1693. The Amish began emigrating to America in the 18th century, mostly settling in Pennsylvania. In the 1930s, they came to wider attention and were romanticised for resisting moves to shut down the small schools their children attended. Later generations have found other aspects of their lifestyle to admire: in the 60s, counterculture rebels looked to them as off-grid pioneers in the 80s, they were celebrated for their traditional craft skills more recently, it’s been their long tradition of organic farming, with branded grocers opening in New York City.Outsiders are allowed to join the community – though only an estimated one in three stick with the creed they are encouraged to spend time living the Amish lifestyle for several months before baptism into the church.Converts include Marlene Miller, a former high school majorette who joined half a century ago, after marrying an Amish man. In a memoir, she wrote that the hardest things were learning to speak German and to sew just three of her 10 children are still in the faith.Although clearly devout, with hymn sheets stuck to his own kitchen table for the family to sing together, Sam admits to me the day after our dinner that, as a teenager, he questioned his belief – if it “was a learned thing rather than the truth”. He has friends who have left to join “the English” – the Amish term for outsiders. He also confesses that, as a bird-watcher, he would love to have a camera. “But our values are down to our connection to a faith that will be discarded if we adopt technology.”Sam, who has travelled abroad, says he is old enough to remember a pre-digital era, before computers and smartphones. “I can see the big changes they have brought to society, which my children will never see. There is more independence on the inidual level, but people have become more selfish – everything is for themselves. We value the idea of working for the betterment of everyone. Christ said we are to be a light to the world. We are not saying we want everyone to be Amish, or that we are better, but our goal in a selfish society is to show people that it works if we are honest in our dealings, respect people and go the extra mile.”Watching him lead one of his young sons around the lush fields and milking his cows, assisted by a younger brother and automated machinery, it’s clear this thoughtful man loves the rural way of life, with his 800 cows and renovated old buildings. He is scathing, however, about industrialised farming, with tens of thousands of cattle in one place. “In America, we are so driven by capitalism that everything has to get bigger and bigger all the time,” he says.They may use a horse and buggy for trips into town, clip-clopping along the roads alongside thundering trucks, but the Amish will take taxis and trains when needed. I am surprised to learn that both Sam and Daniel have flown abroad, to places such as Guatemala and Haiti for charity work. Daniel explains that the Amish reject many modern items for fear of assimilation. So they do not own cars, for instance, because the machines detach people from their extended families too easily and can create envy, not because they are deemed “sinful” in themselves.Daniel does not buy a newspaper, because he does not want his children becoming interested in sport – “sport seems to be the God of America, so competitive and with so much money” – yet they play volleyball and he will happily read a paper if he finds one on a train. So they know about their disruptive president, despite opting out of the electoral process. Yet when I mention Donald Trump’s bellicose language on North Korea, one young adult asks me if his country has gone to war.Given the world’s political turbulence, such ignorance might sound almost blissful. But some who leave the Amish community have spoken about a dark side to the peaceable Amish facade people who leave the church can be shunned by their families for the rest of their lives. I am told of one person, for instance, who was recently barred from attending her own mother’s funeral, having walked out of the sect.Former church member Ira Wagler wrote a bestseller called Growing Up Amish, the story of how he stole away in the middle of the night, aged 17 – finally quitting the church nine years later, on his fifth attempt. “People put the Amish on a pedestal but they are just people,” he tells me. “There are some very good things about their culture that I respect, now I have joined the real world. I was taken to the top of our house, given a goose wing and made to sweep steps as my job when I was only three. The message is you do not deserve anything unless it’s earned. But if someone’s barn burns down, you help rebuild it.”Wagler tells me that Amish children have little sense of the outside world. “My childhood had great security, with black-and-white boundaries in a very warm community. It was on a farm, so we worked and played – out in the fields or fishing in the creeks. I have very warm memories.” But he points out the flipside of such isolation, and the intense pressure to stay loyal to the church. “It is mind control. You knew that if you stepped outside the culture you’d go to hell. It was only in my mid-20s that I realised: you don’t have to be Amish.”Like others, he talks about the impact of technology, which many Amish recognise has confronted them with existential dilemmas. Some already use mobile phones children are secretly using social media and those with businesses often need email and a website. Meanwhile, firms and retailers are using notes and coins less a cashless society could ultimately force even the most conservative groups to adopt technology.“The smartphone is a threat to the Amish not only for the darker aspects of the internet, such as access to pornography, but also for the way it can change the way we behave,” says Erik Wesner, founder of the authoritative Amish America website. “We have all got quickly used to finding instant solutions online. These can erode traditional values that the Amish revere, such as patience and dependence upon their community. And unlike a car or pickup truck, a smartphone is easily hidden.”Yet Wesner believes the Amish will adapt, with more conservative groups resisting the digital age for as long as possible, just as some still resist electricity and modern plumbing while the majority retain defining markers such as austere clothing and a ban on car ownership. “They do gradually change, although at slower pace.”One comparatively recent adaptation has been the shift from farming to business. One study found more than 10,000 Amish-owned firms across the US – with lower failure rates than average, despite the fact that most Amish leave school at 14, making them unlikely entrepreneurs.One of the biggest is a kitchen cabinet business started by Ola Yoder in his barn two decades ago. It now churns out 6,000 units a day from an industrial park in Indiana, employing 500 staff. Unusually, Yoder, now 72, spent seven years outside the Amish in his early 20s. “I saw how other people lived and decided it was not for me or my kids,” he says, although he still has many “English” friends. He also spent time working for a major company. “They had rules about drugs and swearing, but no one enforced them,” he says. “In corporate America, it is all about climbing up the ladder.”Yoder bans mobile phones at work, asking why you would want to employ someone who is always texting, and says he sticks to Amish values in business. “Success is about finding peace within yourself and your family. For the Amish, money is just a tool to enable you to live your faith. What good would it do, to have smart cars and fly all over the world?”Before I leave Morris, with its rolling farmland and warning signs urging drivers to beware of horse-drawn buggies, Daniel tells me he knows outsiders think their approach to life looks outdated and tough. “But all those seeking freedom seem to have more traps than ever – all their cars, computers and televisions seem to make their lives more morose,” he says. “I think our lifestyle is actually easier.”That may be true. But only time will tell, as their numbers continue to rise, whether they can hold out against what Sam Weaver calls “the glitz and glamour” of the modern world.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51b1732f000ff1b6b7863eaa744d417151b6ae4/0_375_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1995158d903fc1cffb2eeff53c198b44","title":"guardian and observer telethon raises 40k in a single saturday","story":"Appeal for Windrush migrant charities reaches nearly £300k in just over a week and Observer 2018 appeal telethon in support of Windrush migrant charities took £40,000 in a day on Saturday, pushing the overall total raised to nearly £300,000 in just over a week.Throughout the day a team of journalists including Owen Jones, Katharine Viner, Gary Younge, John Crace and Marina Hyde turned the  newsroom into a pop-up call centre to take phone donations from readers.The appeal, which runs over the festive period, is raising money for five charities which helped expose the Windrush scandal and continue to provide ongoing support to people wrongly left homeless and destitute, or facing deportation as a result of the hostile environment immigration system.The charities are Praxis Community Projects, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, the Refugee and Migrant Centre Black Country and Birmingham, the Runnymede Trust, and the Law Centres Network.They provide legal assistance and advice, advocacy and in some cases welfare support including food and shelter. In most cases they cannot access legal aid to carry out immigration work and rely heavily on charitable and philanthropic donations.“We thank all the  and Observer readers who have donated to the telethon yesterday and to the appeal so far,” said Nimrod Ben-Cnaan, director of policy at the Law Centres Network. “We are heartened by your support. It will allow Law Centres to help more people, whose lives are devastated by the hostile environment.“It also shows the scale of ongoing public outrage at this inhumane policy, and our shared determination to bring it to an end.”This year’s appeal was inspired by the ’s revelation that thousands of British citizens of Caribbean background, many of whom had been living in the UK for decades, were denied rights and basic services such as NHS treatment because they were unable to provide documentation to show they were legally resident. Some were wrongly deported, others were placed in detention centres. writer Amelia Gentleman worked closely with the charities to reveal the scandal, publishing a series of articles that culminated in the resignation last year of the then home secretary Amber Rudd. The government subsequently apologised and promised to reform the process but little has changed in practice and the charities are warning that many thousands more people, including EU and Commonwealth migrants, will face similar injustices.The 2018 appeal runs until 7 January 2019.

In a separate project, MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis donated £325,000 to pay for a financial education textbook for teenagers to be sent to every secondary school in England.The Money House project aims to build financial literacy among 16-to-25-year-olds, teaching them the financial basics of budgeting, finance, debt and avoiding scams to prepare them for life as tenants, both in social housing and the private rented sector. It is hoped this will give them the knowledge to live independently and has been used in Greenwich, Newham, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets.The five-day course is now mandatory for young people applying for social housing in the four London boroughs, as well as for sheltered housing providers such as Centrepoint, the YMCA and Depaul.Chantel Bishop, 19, says the project helped her take control of her finances. During the course, she learned to read a payslip and understand her consumer rights. Games and role-play situations that teenagers in her position are used to bring what can be difficult concepts to life.“I have learned so much, I kid you not,” said Bishop. “They’re not like teachers just telling you what’s going on – they share stories to help you understand. If someone presents you with something, don’t just sign the paper, click OK or say yes – read the terms and conditions otherwise it comes and bites you on the back.” Two of her friends are pregnant and she is encouraging them to attend. “I’m telling you, if this was in school I would be there all day.”Peterson said that previously she would become stressed when confronted with everyday payments that were due. “I’ve learned about all the different types of credit, so if I get bills I can understand what they mean without panicking,” she said.It has shown tangible results with a two-thirds drop in eviction rates among those who took the course.Hawa Tifou, 20, from Newham, went to the course before leaving the care system and moving into a council flat. She says it helped her understand her tenancy and the importance of reading small print. “I would have walked in and just signed off everything thinking ‘whatever’ and probably get kicked out in a couple of months down the line,” she said. “I don’t really stress, because I know what to do and what not to do now.”Sometimes, parents passing on their limited financial information can lead to more harm than good. “A parent may have told them that credit cards are bad, because they had a bad experience, so they assume payday loans must be better,” said Smith-Patel.Teaching at-risk teenagers about money is itself a cost-saving exercise, according to The Money House. It costs on average £7,056 to evict a tenant from social housing, so it is far more cost-effective to keep them there. Independent valuators ERS estimate some £300,000 in direct savings from the project so far. Given that 10,000 young people leave care annually, MyBnk believes this could save cash-strapped councils millions of pounds. As well as the sharp drop in evictions, ERS found participants were much less likely to owe substantial amounts of money.Guy Rigden, chief executive of MyBnk, said working with vulnerable young people at these transitional periods was crucial, especially with their social and key workers under immense pressure. “That’s when they are at the highest risk of making the poor financial decisions that can have lifelong consequences.”Jade Barnett, 18, from Lewisham, had been living in a foster placement and joining The Money House was a condition of moving out of her semi-independent flat into a council flat under her own tenancy.The digital media and communications student has a radio show at North Kent College and works four shifts a week at Tesco.“I do struggle to pay the bills as I am living on my own and only have a single income,” she says.“I never have spare money to do things for myself, which is hard for me as I’m only 18.” She was looking for practical advice on the best way to borrow money, how to handle credit safely and what to look for on utility or mobile phone bills.“After the course, I felt as if I was ready to fully live on my own and do everything myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1362d345cab52e3ebb789878055307f69f862b31/0_369_4698_2818/master/4698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d99f8ed70aa0fa35a188c84b4423b09e","title":"canelo alvarez rocky fielding world title","story":"The all-conquering Mexican’s latest win felt more like a promotional parade than a genuine world title showdownFor years Canelo Álvarez was hailed as the biggest star of boxing’s post-Floyd Mayweather age. After managing to fill Madison Square Garden to capacity on Saturday night for a wildly violent sparring session with the sacrificial lamb Rocky Fielding, that premise appears beyond dispute.Álvarez, the youngest of seven brothers who each boxed (once all together on the same card), turned professional at 16. He was still a teenager when he signed a contract with Televisa, the TV network known for telenovelas that is among the most watched in all of Latin America. Televisa built him into a household name with his red hair and matinee-idol good looks if not his still-young body of work. That led many sceptical Mexicans to denigrate him as a media creation or, worse, a fraud.To Álvarez’s detractors he will always be the exposed 23-year-old made by Mayweather to appear as if he was stumbling around in the dark trying to find the light switch in their 2013 meeting. Even as he rebuilt admirably from the psychological wreckage of his lone professional setback, there was little about Álvarez that fitted the mould of the archetypal Mexican fistic warrior: from his fair skin and cinnamon-coloured hair to a counter-punching style at odds with the devil-may-care aggression, reckless pressure and machismo embodied by predecessors like Julio César Chávez, Rubén Olivares, Carlos Zárate and Juan Manuel Márquez.There was also the perception that he was avoiding a match with his longtime middleweight bogeyman Gennady Golovkin, which became the most attractive fight that could be made in boxing after Álvarez won the ision’s lineal title from Miguel Cotto in his biggest win to that point.But Álvarez has continued to develop into one of the finest all-around fighters in the sport, breaking his opponents down with an uncommon blend of power, patience, poise and exquisite technique. When he finally took on Golovkin last year and was fortunate to come away with a split draw, Álvarez changed tactics dramatically in the rematch and went toe to toe in the centre of the ring with one of the sport’s most feared punchers, relying on adaptability and resolve to earn a signature win in a classic encounter.Now squarely in the prime of a Hall of Fame career that has included world titles in three weight classes, the 28-year-old Álvarez is threatening to disrupt the financial model that has governed the sport for nearly five decades.There was nothing about Saturday’s three-round destruction of the overmatched Fielding to dispel Álvarez’s reputation as a child of privilege. In the end, the gratuitous display was little more than an eight-minute infomercial for DAZN, the upstart subscription streaming service that signed Álvarez to a five-year, 11-fight deal worth a minimum of $365m, a pact that’s been touted breathlessly as the richest athlete contract in sports history.DAZN is gambling that Álvarez is big enough a draw to convince everyone who signed up for a free, one-month subscription for Saturday’s fight to stay on for US$9.99 a month. But whether it will exist as a streaming service for boxing nerds or blossom into the Netflix of sports will depend almost entirely on whether DAZN can reach beyond the sport’s core audience into the broader realm of casual fans.Which explains how Álvarez found himself making his New York debut on Saturday in a showcase fight against a hand-picked opponent that often felt more like a promotional appearance and brand-building exercise than a legitimate world-title contest. Fighting eastwards of Texas for only the second time ever – the first was a 2008 scrap at the Miccosukee Indian Gaming Resort on the western outskirts of Miami – Álvarez’s objective was less Fielding’s second-tier WBA title, which allowed promoters to dress up the affair as a meaningful bid for history, and more the expansion of his commercial footprint.Which is all fine if it means good fights are ahead. Until then, let’s wait and see."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/593eb59388d872ae040d0779ca2f42cbec19fc6d/0_184_3404_2042/master/3404.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7670a7dbbabe43059808c1d039052f4d","title":"newcastle edinburgh european champions cup match report","story":"Much has rightly been made of Newcastle’s rise under Dean Richards but this match underlined the excellent work being done by another former Leicester legend as Richard Cockerill’s Edinburgh claimed a famous and deserved victory.Both men enjoyed glittering careers during their spells at Welford Road and both ended up being sacked. While Richards went on to Harlequins and pitched up at Newcastle in 2012 after a three-year ban from rugby for his part in the Bloodgate scandal, Cockerill has similarly been forced to reinvent himself elsewhere.Ditched by Leicester almost two years ago, the man who guided the Tigers to three Premiership titles is performing a sterling job in the Scottish capital and this was some way to mark his 48th birthday. More significantly it maintained Edinburgh’s position at the Pool Five summit and hoisted them seven points above Newcastle, who slipped to third after Montpellier’s thumping home win over Toulon.“This puts us in a great position to qualify now,” Cockerill, the head coach, said after his men beat Newcastle for the second time in 10 days. “We put pressure on ourselves to come here and win and to do that in Europe is new territory for us. We’ve got a good forward pack and in the second half we took the game by the scruff of the neck. I thought we deserved to win and then it was about making sure Newcastle got nothing out of the game as well.”Few can forget Cockerill’s talismanic influence as a player, intimidating and inspiring in equal measure. He has transmitted that same desire to his Edinburgh side. This performance, Edinburgh’s first away win in eight months, was characterised by the kind of belligerence that typified Cockerill’s career as 15 unanswered second-half points carried the visitors home.Newcastle recalled a number of key men who missed last weekend’s defeat at Murrayfield and claimed an exhilarating opening try through their hard-hitting wing, Sinoti Sinoti, in the 19th minute.After a high bomb was expertly fielded by Simon Hammersley, Sinoti’s pass sent Niki Goneva on a searing break down the left flank. Goneva’s neat inside pass found Sinoti, who had enough pace to score the only try of a first half which ended 8-6 in Newcastle’s favour but the lead could have been greater after two further line breaks came to nothing.After the interval Edinburgh took control – not suddenly but systematically as three minutes into the second half the scrum-half, Henry Pyrgos, chipped the ball behind the Newcastle defence. The ball bounced wickedly on Kingston Park’s artificial playing surface, falling kindly for James Johnstone, the onrushing centre, to touch down under the posts.Suddenly Edinburgh overflowed with self-belief and began to dominate field position, forcing the Falcons back towards their own line. Chances began to proliferate for the visitors as Newcastle struggled for any kind of attacking rhythm until lock Tevita Cavubatiwas denied in the left corner in the 69th minute.Play was switched to the right flank to Sinoti, who was similarly kept at bay by more obstinate Edinburgh defending.In the 74th minute the game was finally up for the Falcons as the wing Duhan van der Merwe backed himself to beat the Newcastle defence in the left corner for a fine inidual score.“It’s good for Scottish rugby that Edinburgh will go to Toulon on top of the group, Cockerill added. “We’ll try and win there but, if we don’t, then we will host Montpellier at Murrayfield still with a chance of finishing first or second. We’ve earned the right to be here and we’re giving it a bash. We don’t want to be the plucky losers and sometimes we’ve had that tag.“I’m enjoying the challenge and Scotland are playing exceptionally well as a national team, so why shouldn’t we perform on the club stage? That’s my job.”For Newcastle, qualification appears an uphill task and Richards knows where his priorities lie with the Falcons currently bottom of the Premiership. Newcastle’s director of rugby lost Johnny Williams, Nemani Nagusa and Glen Young to first-half injuries.

A couple of false shots from Paine, one of which earns him four runs as the edge bounces through the cordon gap.AP emails in: “Video evidence suggests if the on-field decision had been not out, the 3rd umpire couldn’t have found conclusive evidence to overturn that either, Yes? Did the onfield umpires unwittingly influence this Test at a crucial point, by not giving the batsman benefit of the doubt?”Well, no. Because the umpire thought it was out. Unless you want umpires to give every decision not out and let the third umpire decide all of them. This decision was like any decision for caught behind or lbw. The standing umpire saw it live, made a call, and then the video review looked for evidence to overturn it. There was nothing conclusive.50th over: Australia 134-4 (Khawaja 42, Paine 9) Shami from the other end, his first ball keeps low but is wide of Usman’s off stump. So is most of the over, which is duly left alone.49th over: Australia 134-4 (Khawaja 42, Paine 9) Bumrah to start the day, which is a good move. He was so good yesterday, and a bit unlucky – caused a lot of false shots and appeals. Each batsman squeezes out a single at one stage in the over. Right then. Australia 175 in front. Four wickets down. Khawaja on 41 and Paine on 8. India need wickets. Sun is shining. Let’s go.The news just in is that Aaron Finch has been cleared to bat today. Presumably he’ll come out at the fall of the next wicket. And may just try to clear the pickets and swell the lead fast. That could be fun.Alright, let’s do this. Might as well put my cards on the table. First, these kind of catches will never meet agreement. I’ve already had people emailing saying that you can clearly see that it bounced, and clearly see that it didn’t. There are still images on Twitter that make it look dodgy, because literally every close low catch has a couple of frames that can make it look dodgy. If they didn’t, then the batsmen would walk and the umpires wouldn’t check it. All low catches look a bit dubious, at best, on television screens, and even worse in still images.I think it was out. And I wrote an article last night (scroll down for the link) rhapsodising over Kohli’s innnings. I would have loved to see him go on. So there’s no bias one way or the other, which is the absurd thing that a lot of fans will say. Check out Harsha Bhogle’s Twitter, for instance – he’s being attacked by self-appointed ‘patriots’ because he had the temerity to explain how the decision-making process currently works in international cricket. Now he’s apparently a fifth columnist. (Most newspapers these days can’t afford one columnist.)The reason I think it’s out is because it was a hard edge, and the ball flew very flat and direct. It wasn’t looping down to the ground like a lot of low catches are. Watching it live I thought it was clean, and live-action replays looks clean. Handscomb es across with his hand on the ground by the time the ball arrives. There is a bounce, because it bounces off his fingers. The still images online are all of a moment when he has fingers underneath the ball.Now, can you categorically say that there’s no turf between the fingers that touches the ball at the same time? You can’t, because there’s no way to track that sort of detail. All we do know is that a good bit of his hand was around the ball, and the catch would likely have been taken even if the turf wasn’t there. It looked clean enough, so the umpires were happy to give a soft signal that it was out. And the replay didn’t show anything conclusive to overturn that.For those saying the soft signal shouldn’t exist, the alternative is to go back to what we once had, where every single low catch was given not out, and players effectively have immunity if the ball is taken near the ground. The reason we brought in things like the DRS was to overturn decisions that were clearly wrong. Ones that are line-ball, there’s injustice to be corrected.One other thing I can tell you – the overnight intrigue has not translated into interest at the ground. Perth Stadium is deserted. I walked in only a few minutes ago and the footpaths and ticket gates had the merest handful of people using them. Inside the ground, it’s nt quite the MCG during a Shield game, but it’s not much better. A smattering of people at the members’ end across a few tiers, but the population on the arena – camera crews and players warming up and groundsmen and hangers-on – are in danger of outnumbering them. There are massed empty banks of seating through the other three quarters of the giant continguous grandstand. I know it’s a Monday morning, but it’s also a week shy of Christmas at the debut of a top-class venue, and the fourth day of a gripping contest. I’d like it formally entered on the record that I was a Lemon for decades before Liz was even invented. Other than that, thanks JP. Big day yesterday alright for the news faff that surrounds the cricket. I thought that Tim Paine was shrewd enough to use the less brusque appellation ‘big head’, knowing that he was close enough to the stump mic to risk being picked up. But Howcroft hears ‘dickhead’. I suppose it’s the insult version of the Handscomb catch. All that faff aside, we had a brilliant day’s Test cricket yesteday. India’s pace bowlers were outstanding. Finch looked in great touch, suddenly, until his injury. Khawaja battled hard. Kohli was supreme. R. Pant was exciting. For a day, we actually did have it all.Right, that’s enough from me for the time being, over to the maestro Geoff Lemon, my second favourite of all the Lemons (sorry mate, Liz Lemon 4 eva). Reporting from the Perth press box I’m sure there will be some juicy updates on all the overnight drama.One story you might have missed during yesterday’s action was the reopening of the Monkeygate controversy. In an interview with Adam Gilchrist for Fox Sports, to be aired tonight, Andrew Symonds indicates Harbhajan Singh later apologised to him for the diplomatic crisis, apparently going so far as to break down in tears. “He actually broke down crying, and I could just see that was a huge weight off his shoulders,” Symonds says. “He had to get rid of it. We shook hands and I gave him a hug and said: ‘Mate, it’s all good. It’s dealt with’.”Shortly after Cricinfo’s Dan Brettig published the transcript of Symonds’ comments, Harbhajan responded, pointedly questioning their accuracy.More to come on this one, for sure.Waiting for Godot it is not, but the stump mic picked up an entertaining exchange between competing skippers yesterday evening. Kohli: “If you mess up it’s two-nil.”Paine: “You’ve got to bat first, dickhead.”As a reasonably recent migrant to Australian shores I love the local application of “dickhead”. Delivered with quickness - the “ck” almost morphing into a “g” - and the disdainful downward inflection make it so satisfying both playful and cutting. In the heat of battle I thought it was a choice riposte from a captain facing the impossible job of being both a sporting alpha and conciliatory prince charming. However, this analysis from @CricProf suggests Harris’ leave, while obviously a bad one, perhaps wasn’t that gross a miscalculation.An excellent point has been raised by email from David Marshall. “Any discussion on Harris’ disastrous leave yesterday, and whether there was any concussion from the earlier knock on the helmet? I didn’t hear much discussion on 7 about it when the wicket fell.”I think this is definitely an issue that requires following up. Are cricket’s concussion protocols adequate? We know it’s a major issue in contact sports around the world - is cricket doing enough? It doesn’t seem too wild a theory to suggest Harris’ judgement could have been impaired by the fierce blow he received earlier in his knock. Finch’s injury has erted attention from what promises to be a thrilling couple of days of Test cricket. All results remain possible with the prospect of a nail-biting fifth day conclusion.That Australia hold the upper hand owes a lot to the contentious dismissal of Virat Kohli, caught by Peter Handscomb off the bowling of Pat Cummins. There is far from unanimous agreement about the cleanliness of the catch but once the soft signal indicated it was out, replays failed to prove conclusively that the decision should be overturned. My two cents: out. I look forward to the deluge of correspondence informing me I’m wrong. Finch’s retirement yesterday curtailed a promising opening partnership with Marcus Harris and opened the door for India to regain a foothold in a match that was sliding out of their control.Here’s Geoff Lemon’s report from Perth on yesterday’s action, putting Finch’s misfortune in context.Here’s the second of those two net session scares. It would seem more work is required on that swivel-pull against some friendlier bowlers before it’s next unfurled against Test-calibre opponents. An aspect of the concern for Finch is due to this not being the first time this summer the ODI skipper has been struck on that part of his body. Mitchell Starc has injured him twice before in net practice, almost preventing Finch from appearing in the pre-Test ODI series.Here’s vision of one of those incidents and Finch discussing his recovery and injury management. So, to the first order of business, how is Aaron Finch’s right index finger? Not as bad as first feared.Following the conclusion of play yesterday Australia’s coach, Justin Langer, explained that x-rays revealed there is no fracture and Finch could bat today if required. “It’s not fractured, which is really positive for us,” Langer told SEN Radio. “He was playing so well. It’s nice to have Finchy being able to bat, hopefully, in the second dig. Every run here is very important.”Good morning everyone and welcome to live coverage of day four of the second Test from Perth. We’re firing up slightly earlier than usual to allow plenty of time to get through all the talking points from yesterday’s action. What talking points, you might be asking? Well, there’s Aaron Finch’s dodgy digit and Virat Kohli’s dubious dismissal for a start, and we could venture into the reopening of old wounds once thought securely locked away in a safe marked Monkeygate: do not touch.I’ll be with you for about an hour or so, after which Geoff Lemon will perform this task with much greater wit. Until the handover, you can join in via Twitter (@JPHowcroft) or email (jonathan.howcroft.freelance@the).

If in doubt, I now reach for Home Alone – guaranteed laughs for all ages – or White Christmas, which has that reassuring retro glow.”Smith has hosted private film events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club2. Tim Halilaj, award-winning mixologist“People always run out of ice at Christmas parties, so the night before just fill your freezer with plastic containers of water and then hack these bergs into rugged lumps – they’re more on-trend than cubes. For totally clear ice, boil tap water, let it cool and then freeze it.”3. Shona Vertue, personal trainer (and David Beckham’s yoga teacher)“The gym seems like a distant memory over Christmas, but it doesn’t have to be that way.

If nothing else, it gives you a break from the family for half an hour!”4. Garrett Moore, party planner and co-founder of Immersive Cult“Go for candlelight, scattered lamps and dim light. Some people feel self-conscious at parties and they don’t want to feel like they’re being watched, so low lighting is very conducive to good times. And create welcoming spaces where people can sit somewhere quiet and have a nice conversation if they want to. Maybe have a mistletoe area or create a little grotto-type nook. It’s nice for guests to feel like they have options and places to explore.”“I also have a bottle of Rémy Martin.

Polly Hadden-Paton, professional organiser to Suki Waterhouse and Lily Allen“I like to keep a few nice bottles, scented candles or tins of biscuits wrapped up in a drawer as fallback presents in case someone unexpectedly buys you something. And if they’re not claimed, that’s even better, as you can just enjoy them yourself.”7. Wrapologist Kirsten Westlake, from gift-wrapping service Wrapsody“Double-sided Sellotape is my secret weapon. It’s invisible and makes the finished product appear super slick. Most people come unstuck by using too much paper, which causes bulky, messy folds. The secret is to measure before you cut and use just enough paper to meet by about a centimetre.”8. Candice Brathwaite, parenting blogger“One tried-and-tested Christmas save if you’ve got a house full of children is advent stockings. I put them up on 1 December – containing 24 tiny, totally inexpensive gifts. The most important thing is that they aren’t allowed to open their advent presents until the end of the day, so it’s the perfect bribe to try and keep them in order until the evening.”9. Patrick Grant, fashion designer“If you’re having a suit tailored, have them cut you an evening suit with both a dress vest and a cummerbund. By this simple expedient, you can wear the same suit throughout the Christmas party season. Just switch between the two, change up your pocket hanky and, hey presto, with one suit you will look subtly different but always impeccable.”Grant has hosted private fashion events as part of the La Maison Rémy Martin members’ club10. Florist Anna Potter, from Swallows and Damsons“Bowls of one kind of fruit such as apples, figs, pomegranates or pears on a table make great centrepieces. Any fruit or vegetable that has an interesting shape, colour or texture looks amazing and harks back to Christmas being about feasting. And a sprig of rosemary looks beautiful on a place setting and also smells great. Or sneak some foliage from the garden and wrap it into a leafy circle to make a mini wreath for each guest.”11. Jackson Boxer, chef and restaurateur, St Leonards and Brunswick House“I make up a large ballotine of cured foie gras loaded with black truffles and brandy. It’s good to have on hand to quell appetites if anything goes wrong and causes any delays, or anyone shows up unexpectedly. And it’s outrageously delicious smeared on top of butter-fried cold Christmas pudding – a sentiment heartily endorsed by both chefs Fergus Henderson and Jeremy Lee, who know about such things.”12. Sam Lyle, co-founder of Pines and Needles“So many people order trees that are way too big for their room and have to hack bits off. The width of the tree is typically a third of the height, so be realistic about how much space you want it to take up. Trees are like flowers, they need water to stay fresh, so give your tree up to a litre of water every couple of days for the first few days, and then a litre once a week after that.”Whether you need to impress last-minute guests with some fun, festive cocktails or take Hadden-Paton’s advice and stock up on a few bottles of something smart to keep as emergency gifts, Rémy Martin could just be your ultimate seasonal save – the key ingredient to Bosi’s cocktail menu, the perfect accompaniment to pickled cockle popcorn (of course) and a rather elegant gift"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals.

Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2023de63811aee4a9d67e5f9b10f3e4797ff3b14/0_54_1445_867/master/1445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d8faa07753c074dcaf2e59778857ab","title":"send us a tip on a uk winter walk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"A good walk and fresh air are perfect for blowing away the Christmas cobwebs.

The channel has since aired investigations by Dooley into everything from Mexico’s drug war to the sexualisation of Japanese girls. Cohen, who went on to be the BBC’s director of television, had advised her to eschew a conventional journalistic persona in favour of her own natural empathy.Fast forward 10 years to exposure of a very different kind in the form of her victory in this year’s Strictly Come Dancing on BBC One and it’s clear Dooley’s ability to connect with as big an audience as it gets on terrestrial television makes her a force to be reckoned with. At a time when young, female faces from working-class backgrounds are at a premium in television, not least at the BBC, the broadcasting world is her oyster after years of building up a dedicated fanbase among younger viewers.“She is just very warm and creates a very human connection with interviewees,” said David Fuller, a journalist and film-maker who has worked with Dooley on productions including 2016’s investigation into the Russian sex trade. “She was already a kind of celebrity at that point. I haven’t watched Strictly so I don’t know if she has shown this, but she is also very self-aware and very amusing. She would joke from time to time and point at herself, saying: ‘Face of a generation, Dave, face of a generation’.”Dooley’s own wry self-deprecation about her marketability aside, casting this year’s winner of the BBC’s flagship entertainment show as a breakout star is somewhat off the mark. But while some ask: “Where has she come from?” the BBC Three controller, Damian Kavanagh, speaks glowingly of a talent that he says has been “developing and growing for some time”.Strictly Come Dancing attracted a peak of 12.7 million viewers for Saturday night’s final as Dooley and her professional partner, Kevin Clifton, emerged as the people’s champions in a vote following three months of competition. Despite scoring lower among the judges than fellow finalists Ashley Roberts and Faye Tozer – both of whom have music backgrounds – Dooley had been widely tipped as favourite alongside the fourth finalist, YouTube star Joe Sugg.Her reply to to the question of how she planned to celebrate was classic Dooley: “Go to McDonald’s. I’m starving,” as was a subsequent tweet that made light of a so-called “wardrobe malfunction”.“I’ve won Strictly and flashed my knickers. A perfect Sat night,” she told her more than 234,000 followers.To fans, it’s the type of language that reflects her down to earth Luton roots, a town to which she returned in 2013 to make a documentary about extremism, at one point interviewing the far right figure Stephen Yaxley-Lennon – who calls himself Tommy Robinson – whom she spoke of knowing when growing up.Dooley, who left school at 16, is spoken of by broadcasting colleagues as being instinctively “streetwise”, an asset also seemingly married with steely determination.“She is tenacious and she is charming,” said one, who spoke of Dooley catching malaria while shooting in the early days of her career in the Ivory Coast, returning again after recovering in the UK.“She can charm her way out of trouble or into wherever she needs to be, whether it’s with the driver of the jeep, a shy 12-year-old interviewee or a menacing government official.”Dooley spoke of her own candid style during an interview with the Observer: “You have to be brave and ask the questions on the tip of your tongue. Sometimes, you’re cringeing inside. But you can’t have people screaming at the screen the question you didn’t have the balls to ask.”A more cynical reading among some industry watchers has, meanwhile, viewed this year’s Strictly, and previous episodes of ITV’s I’m a Celebrity… as a classic tactic to introduce potential future stars into the mainstream.It’s a view at odds with the reality of Dooley’s appeal as told by Kavanagh, who said she has “a whole tranche of fans who are literally waiting for a new documentary by her to drop on iPlayer”.“I went to one in London a few months ago and it was basically packed to the rafters with young men and women who were in thrall to her as she spoke, and when there were questions afterwards, every one of them started off by telling her how much she had changed their lives.”While Dooley’s next steps will be closely watched, Kavanagh pointed out that she has already worked on a number of films for BBC One and has further titles on the way with BBC Three. Her appeal has been clear for some time. Last year’s documentary on young DUP members – suddenly relevant again to UK politics – was one of the most-watched programmes for a period last year on iPlayer, as visible a gauge of popularity as one might find.Will success change her? The bets are very much against that happening. “She is basically extremely down to earth and decent,” added Fuller.“In fact, the only difficulty we had in Russia with her was that she didn’t like using the lift. You could read into that what you will, but the truth is that she is claustrophobic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0064293ab03ef5146fc471ab8f1971a9c904ffb/240_0_2320_1392/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25ae5949b4e011d03c72e356b4edd564","title":"swimwear designer sian gabbidon is this years apprentice","story":"The 26-year-old will get a £250,000 investment from Lord Sugar after winning BBC seriesSwimwear fashion brand owner Sian Gabbidon has won this year’s series of The Apprentice.The 26-year-old said she was left speechless after being named by Lord Sugar as the winner, receiving a £250,000 investment from the tycoon.The Leeds-based entrepreneur defeated nut milk drink brand owner Camilla Ainsworth in the boardroom in the final after presenting their business plans to more than 200 experts at London’s City Hall.Gabbidon said: “I can’t believe it’s happened. Not that I didn’t think I could win it but it’s just real. It’s crazy. I’m absolutely over the moon.”She added: “We went in guns blazing, both of us, we both said things about each other’s businesses, but at the end of the day I did come in this to win. I’m sure Camilla will be massively successful in whatever she does.“For me, I wouldn’t have entered the show if I didn’t think I had it in me to win. I would say that it is very easy to underestimate how hard the tasks are. I’ll never, ever judge any of the other candidates. It’s so hard to put yourself through the tasks.Runner-up Ainsworth, 22, said: “Although I would have loved to win, I’m just really proud of myself as the youngest ever finalist of The Apprentice. It takes a while to sink in but immediately I was kind of in fight mode. As a person I am very positive and optimistic. I gave myself a good few seconds to be quite gutted then I thought, ‘Right, reset and go again’.”In the final episode, the pair welcomed back the contestants Sugar had previously fired to help them create a video advert and billboard for their companies. They then had to give a pitch to a group of industry experts, who shared their thoughts on the business plans with Lord Sugar.Ainsworth said appearing in front of the panel, which included leading business people from the fashion and health drink worlds, had been a frightening experience.After a final impassioned pitch from both candidates, Sugar made his decision. He told them: “Camilla, I’ve said to you earlier on, I find you a big risk, a very, very big risk. Having said that, there is a growing market here.“Sian, it’s a crowded market – that’s a big, big concern for me, but you are an expert in your field, and you are a good designer, there’s no question of that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8225491e036e21a51706d6e09dd2ce24b80ac6d5/0_990_3804_2283/master/3804.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa177e907c37c6466a4e9b1c2da63767","title":"the apprentice finale review surely time to dismantle this panto","story":"Sian and Camilla served up two poor TV adverts, a questionable logo and a product called ‘nut milk’ as they competed for investment from Lord SugarSometimes when I drive to B\u0026ampQ, I pass that little cafe where the losing Apprentice teams go to lick their wounds before the next firing. It is real enough, unlike Lord Sugar’s boardroom, which was purpose-built in a nearby studio a cross between a Bond villain’s lair and the Starship Enterprise, it is like a stage perfect for a late-capitalist panto.The Apprentice has now completed its 14th season. It is still trading on the cliches it created, still playing the bumbling venality of the contestants for laughs while trying to convince the viewer that something significant is at stake.Last week was the one where the five finalists are grilled about their business proposals and exposed as incompetent, deluded and untrustworthy – one more chance to call someone a “prize imbecile” to their face. This episode was the final, the one where they bring back all the old numpties to cock up the presentations of the two hopefuls – in this case, Sian and Camilla – competing for Lord Sugar’s investment.Camilla’s big idea was a range of dairy-free drinks made from nuts. Marketing-wise, her sensibility lies at the not-safe-for-work end of things, veering toward the sensual and non-consensual. She had been repeatedly advised to suppress this tendency, but when your product is called nut milk, the pitfalls are everywhere. Camilla impressed upon her branding team – Kayode, Tom and Jackie – the importance of staying just the right side of cheeky. In response, they came up with the slogan “Wipe your nuts”.Sian’s range of upmarket swimwear has one USP: it is reversible. Sadly, her branding brain trust put together a digital billboard that not only failed to mention this, but didn’t even make it clear that the product in question was a swimming costume. Sian also wanted to keep it classy and they let her down badly. “That looked absolutely shite,” she said. “Let’s be real.”That, along with two not-very-good 30-second adverts, a questionable logo and a nut milk packaging design that put vegans in mind of cows, comprised the weapons that Sian and Camilla brought to their final presentations in front of a bunch of industry experts at City Hall. “Let’s get on with it,” said Lord Sugar, perhaps echoing the sentiments of viewers who have stuck this series out.Unlike the episodes leading up to it, the final always allows a few glimpses of actual expertise: Sian was quite good at making swimwear and Camilla certainly knew a lot about nuts. But these moments were fleeting – the camera was too busy lingering on faces in search of hurt, discomfort and resentment, or a disdainful look from one of Lord Sugar’s two lieutenants, Claude and Karren. It is never clear whether their eyerolls apply to the stupid thing just said, or whether they just save them up and sprinkle them about. By the end, Karren and Claude were singing the praises of the two finalists, an outbreak of regard that, in the context of all that has gone before, seemed to come from nowhere.There was one final trip to the boardroom, including a last chance for the two contenders to slag each other off – a reminder that, in business, the high road is never an option. And then somebody won. I can’t tell you who, because they cut off the end bit of the preview version I watched. You will have heard by now it was Sian or Camilla, if you were minded to care. Or maybe they both won, like last year. Remember that? Me neither.The Apprentice franchise has a lot to answer for, not least for creating a false aura of acumen around a New York real-estate hustler sufficient to get him elected president of the US. The UK version managed to furnish us with Katie Hopkins. Once upon a time, the charmlessness of its contestants was its main asset – the viewer was made to feel they deserved what they got – but I have begun to feel sorryfor them all, for being made to look foolish, for the slimness of their chances and the paltriness of the ultimate prize.The ratings for the show remain buoyant, so the BBC won’t be dismantling that boardroom set any time soon. But, for me, at least – it feels like time to turn off the lights. And wipe your nuts on the way out.

The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of the state they hope to found in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.The US president, Donald Trump, outraged Palestinians last year by recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, a designation that did not acknowledge their claim on the east of the city though it left open the question of its final borders.The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Saturday that Canberra formally recognised West Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, but also reaffirmed his country’s support for a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem under a two-state peace deal.Israel’s foreign ministry responded with a tepid statement that called the Australian move “a step in the right direction”. Netanyahu said on Sunday said he had nothing to add to the statement. Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s minister for regional cooperation and a Netanyahu confidant in the rightwing Likud party, was more openly critical. “To our regret, within this positive news they made a mistake,” he told reporters outside the cabinet room. He referred to Canberra as a “deep and intimate friend of many years’ standing”, but added: “There is no ision between the east of the city and west of the city. Jerusalem is one whole, united. Israel’s control over it is eternal. Our sovereignty will not be partitioned nor undermined. And we hope Australia will soon find the way to fix the mistake it made.”Morrison’s move first surfaced in October, when it was viewed cynically in Australia because it came days before a crucial byelection in an electorate with a strong Jewish representation. His party lost the poll.The Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Saturday’s move was born of “petty domestic politics” in Australia. “All of Jerusalem remains a final-status issue for negotiations, while East Jerusalem, under international law, is an integral part of the occupied Palestinian territory,” he said.

There is no more facade of negotiation, or of a democratic regime … The policy being imposed … is zero tolerance to criticism.” Shutting down such groups was “something we haven’t even seen in Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro”.Nicaraguan human rights defender Bianca Jagger rejected claims the targeted groups were part of a rightwing US-backed conspiracy to topple Ortega as “a complete and total fallacy”.“He wants to eliminate any voice of dissent,” Jagger said of Nicaragua’s president, who became a flag-bearer for the global left thanks to his role in toppling the Somoza dictatorship in 1979.“As someone who supported the revolution in the beginning I feel betrayed.”There was censure too from prominent Latin American leftists including Colombia’s Gustavo Petro. “Daniel Ortega is not leading a democratic revolution,” tweeted the former guerrilla and mayor of Bogotá. “On the contrary, by imposing neoliberal and conservative measures on his people, he is building a tyranny.”The political turbulence rocking what had been considered one of Central America’s most stable countries erupted in April with the outbreak of student-led protests in Managua.Those demonstrations swelled into a nationwide revolt after attempts to put them down with deadly force. Protesters seized control of key highways and towns including the longtime Sandinista stronghold of Masaya.For a while the uprising looked set to dethrone Ortega, 73, whose cold war tussle with Washington made him a revolutionary icon but who is now increasingly seen as an autocrat. But a counter-attack by security forces and armed paramilitary gangs in July helped Ortega reclaim control of the streets and force thousands of dissidents into exile.Since then, he has continued to turn up the heat on opponents, banning street protests and, most recently, targeting NGOs and media outlets who were documenting the turmoil. Journalists have been subjected to a campaign of intimidation and violence intended to snuff out coverage of the crisis, which activists blame for upwards of 325 deaths.As this week’s crackdown unfolded, Ortega made what was reportedly his first overseas trip since the crisis began, traveling to a “Bolivarian” summit in Cuba where he met Maduro and Bolivia’s president, Evo Morales, and railed against “the tyranny of global capitalism”.In an editorial, the opposition newspaper La Prensa slammed Ortega’s “massacre” of civil society. “Deep down what this is all about is that the dictatorship does not tolerate the existence of civil groups who nourish and strengthen democracy and denounce the abuse of power. That is why it is trying to liquidate them.”The ratcheting up of repression has been accompanied by growing pushback from the US.In November the US national security adviser, John Bolton, branded Nicaragua part of a Latin American “troika of terror” alongside Venezuela and Cuba. The Trump administration would “no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores”, Bolton vowed.Jagger, the president of an eponymous human rights foundation, said she was encouraged by US efforts to hasten Ortega’s exit but said other countries needed to step up.“This cannot be only the sanctions from the US. It needs to be sanctions for the European Union, from Canada, from Latin American countries, in order for this to work. The people of Nicaragua are totally vulnerable and at the mercy of a brutal and murderous dictator,” she said.Some on the left also needed to abandon their illusions about Ortega, Jagger added. “This should not be an issue of left or right. This should be an issue of human rights. This should be an issue of morality.”Carlos Fernando Chamorro, the editor of Confidencial, said his journalists would continue to cover the upheaval despite Ortega’s bid to silence them.“We feel persecuted and threatened but our morale is intact,” said Chamorro, whose father’s 1978 assassination helped set in motion the downfall of the Somoza dictatorship.“The people of Nicaragua have been massacred and incarcerated. The very least we can do is stay true to the principles of working for truth, justice and democracy in this country.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733421.1545000710!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert pressure causing stress and burnout among pupils","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOn the question of how the system could be changed, many students said they should have fewer subjects and greater subject choice that suited their abilities. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe pressure of the Leaving Cert is causing stress, burnout and mental health problems among students, according to an official review of senior cycle education in secondary schools.The findings are contained in an Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) report based on consultations by the State’s advisory body on the school curriculum with students, teachers and parents across more than 40 post-primary schools.Students interviewed expressed frustration and concern about the squeeze on their time during the senior cycle when they were trying to complete homework, study, take part in sport and do part-time work.Others said it had “crushed their creativity” because the exams rewarded rote learning and suited those who could “ learn and regurgitate things on a page”.Many said they were forced to give up sport, while some complained of sleep disruption and not having time to meet friends.The report’s findings will inform the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment’s (NCCA) review of senior cycle education.The first cycle of process has looked at teacher, parent and student perspectives on the purpose of senior cycle.Among teachers, the main themes to emerge were how time pressure was leading to rote learning, “teaching to the test” and a negative impact on student motivation and stress levels.This time pressure, coupled with the high stakes nature of the exams, was seen as fuelling “teaching to the test” as teachers aimed to ensure that students were prepared for the exam.Staff in girls’ schools were more likely to emphasise the effects of the current system on rote learning, most likely reflecting the greater prevalence of exam-related stress found among girls.“The large number of students who undertake grinds in multiple subjects is giving rise to ‘burnout’ and mental health problems,” one teacher said.“The need for such grinds stems from fear of underachieving on the day and a pressure from friends to do more and more. What a student does in school is never seen as enough.”On the question of how the system could be changed, many students said they should have fewer subjects and greater subject choice that suited their abilities.Irish was the subject most often mentioned during the discussion of whether any subjects should be compulsory. They also supported a change from the high-stakes model of exams to broader forms of assessment, in line with junior cycle reforms.Career guidance was viewed both as a positive and as a challenge in the system. Many suggested more support may be needed and routes other than higher education should be given greater emphasis.Despite the challenges of the current system, students and teachers found there were also positives.The objective, fair and highly regarded nature of the exam system was mentioned, as was the high quality of teaching staff, mature relationships with teachers and motivational teachers.Transition year, in particular, was a source of positive comment such as work experience opportunities and links with the local community and businesses.The review of the senior cycle is due to continue in the coming year when schools reflect on the extent to which the system provides pathways for further learning such as higher education, further education and apprenticeships.There will be further national seminars and an overview report making suggestions drawn from findings to date will be made.Students, teachers and parents are being invited to join the conversation on the future of the Leaving Cert by visiting the NCCA’s website or by emailing (seniorcycle@ncca.ie)."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733412.1544998616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limited progress after two weeks of katowice climate talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff workers take  stands apart before the end of the final session of the COP24 summit on climate change in Katowice, Poland, on December 15th.

As politicians and diplomats met in Katowice, Poland, seeking to sign off on a guidebook to bring the deal into effect from 2020, the days of commitments under the agreement being only as good as the willingness of national leaders to keep their word were due to come to an end. If that is delivered on in the next two short years based on what was agreed, COP24 can then be considered a success.The end of the first week was a low point marked by a political stalemate when big oil and gas producer countries led by the US and Saudi Arabia refused to “welcome” the latest findings of the UN’s climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change. IPCC chair Hoesung Lee was to later to underline its significance that the temperature goal (containing global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees) is achievable “but that this can only happen if governments take urgent and far-reaching action in all aspects of society, with many implications for policymaking”.UN general-secretary António Guterres attempted to reset the agenda going into the final days: “To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.”Coming into the final stretch, Xie Zhenhua, China’s senior climate official, warned negotiations were “deadlocked” in critical areas, and urged the US to return to the process and “use its leadership”. By the last official day of negotiations, there was still no resolution in sight for critical issues such as financing for developing countries’ climate efforts – though some progress on this was achieved by close of business. But an obvious alliance between the EU and China (especially on having a common rulebook) was coming good in getting a deal of significance over the line. While an earlier side meeting with US officials delivering the usual pro-coal line from Trump-generated headlines, concerns that the US would be hostile in the negotiation rooms proved mostly unfounded – the state department was a constructive force. Beside China, the US oversaw the drafting of the rules governing transparency, a central aspect of the rulebook. An absence of the heavyweight political presence of France, Germany and the UK due to domestic factors was evident throughout the two weeks. It was a row over carbon credits awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as carbon-absorbing forests, that was the big stumbling block, forcing talks into the weekend. Credits count towards countries’ emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, hoping to benefit from its large rainforest cover, repeatedly sought a new wording, which environmental NGOs insisted would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. A package of rules on trading carbon credits across borders was deferred to 2019, after a standoff between Brazil and a coalition of European and climate-vulnerable countries. Ireland consistently supported EU moves to ensure greater transparency and better reporting mechanisms for accounting of national greenhouse gas commitments. It helped strengthen “capacity building”, an essential climate action in developing countries. The Republic did not join the 27 countries who have formed the Coalition for Higher Ambition, who committed to scaling up commitments in line to Paris targets during the COP. Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton flagged to NGOs he met in Katowice that Irish climate commitments would be made when he was sure they could be delivered on.Ireland did, however, join an initiative with eight other EU countries to work together on establishing a carbon floor price. The signatories believe carbon pricing, with supporting policies and measures to send a clear long-term signal to markets by incentivising cost-effect reductions in carbon emissions – and in turn disincentivising new investments in carbon-intensive technologies. They have endorsed the need for a just transition and the creation of high-value jobs in low-carbon sectors.Lead negotiator Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, believes the rulebook is the basis for a transformative process which will require strengthened ambition from the international community. “Science has clearly shown that we need enhanced ambition to defeat climate change.”Whether the response matches what the science says the world needs to do over the next decade is already being widely challenged by climatologists, environmental economists and NGOS.There is clearly insufficient progress on persuading countries to make firm commitments to cut their emissions further than they have already promised. COP24, none the less, has produced a common rulebook with most elements underpinned by clarity after achieving consensus among 195 states. The greater ambition and urgency desperately sought by so many outside the talks remains elusive.

Photograph: EPAShahzaib AkberThe Katowice summit has yielded a common rulebook that will apply across the world on implementing the historic Paris Agreement on climate change, including greater transparency on efforts to reduce carbon emissions contributing to global warming.Parties agreed to revise and enhance their commitments in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) before 2020, according to the 156-page rulebook. They must outline mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries. Parties agree how to undertake a “global stocktake” of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to assess progress. Discussions on robust measures to ensure that countries are held to proper standards and find it harder to wriggle out of commitments dominated the final stages.As current pledges are not enough to limit warming to a 1.5 degrees and to achieve the pact’s goals, countries must commit to greater levels of climate action and support and follow through on those commitments.The main issues to be resolved concern the use of cooperative approaches contained in the agreement’s Article 6. In short, it hinges around carbon trading. Countries were expected to agree rules to ensure they do not double count emissions reductions when one country is allowed to pay another to lower emissions but count those lower emissions towards their own emissions. Resistance, by Brazil in particular, meant sign-off proved impossible. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “1.5 degree” report was the scientific backdrop to much of the negotiations but its stark findings led to a political standoff. Alarmed by efforts to include it in the final text, some oil-exporting countries blocked an endorsement. That prompted uproar from vulnerable countries and environmental groups.The final text omits a previous reference to specific reductions in emissions by 2030, and merely welcomes the “timely completion” of the IPCC report not its conclusions. A delicate balance was struck between concerns of the smallest, poorest and most vulnerable countries the developed nations most responsible for global warming and the emerging economies wary of being saddled with a bigger burden to act. A process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilising $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries was agreed. The text urges developed country parties to channel more grant-based resources for adaptation to climate change as against loans.There is some acknowledgment of the long-standing “loss and damage” issue notably how to provide financial support to countries whose economies are too vulnerable to cope with the impact of climate change. Critical to this is how to finance and compensate losses and damages that have already occurred and are irreversible."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal\u0026rsquos fixed budget has led to large build-up of casesTraining for GPs and gynaecologists ahead of introduction of services in JanuaryNew study suggests younger buyers are more likely to demand higher ethical standardsCremore\u0026rsquos Pat Byrne believes baking has psychological benefits and instils securitySouth African national Mark Morris is the father and primary carer of their five childrenOptions for more accurate data on voters include use of PPS numberPlot of 1.6 acres bought by Dublin Docklands Development Authority in 2006UN summit in Poland signs off on implementation plan for Paris AgreementStaff at Derry City and Strabane to be asked for their views on wearing emblemsContingency plans to be released on Thursday will focus on scenario of \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo BrexitHPRA waives relabelling requirements as industry steps up no-deal preparationsDrew Harris\u0026rsquos launch of review to initiate large-scale Garda reform laid out by commissionSt James\u0026rsquos Wood, in Kilmainham, not built to fire-safety certificate requirementsSt James\u0026rsquos Wood complex built by respected Cosgrave Property Group in 2000\u0026lsquoConvoluted\u0026rsquo delays in transferring calls could leave patients waiting up to eight minutes moreNumber of women in senior board positions still \u0026lsquolagging significantly behind\u0026rsquo, says departmentIndustry to have central role in oversight of how \u0026euro300m education fund is spentStudents tell official review that senior cycle is crushing their creativityBrian Wallace had been last seen at 8.30am on Sunday on the North Circular Road"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Philip ToscanoAFPGetty The Government will spell out for the first time this week some of the “uncomfortable” realities the State will have to address in the event of a no-deal Brexit in March. The latest Government contingency plan, to be released on Thursday, will focus for the first time on the possibility of a “no deal” Brexit instead of the UK having a managed EU departure, which had previously been expected. The document will be published as part of a sequence co-ordinated with the European Commission, which will issue an updated Brexit contingency bulletin on Wednesday. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste Simon Coveney and general secretary to the Government Martin Fraser were finalising the document over the weekend and it will come before the Cabinet for approval on Tuesday. While neither the Government nor the commission document will outline in any huge detail the nature of the “fixes” to be put in place in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Government sources said there would be “new information and it’s going to be uncomfortable”. The Government document is expected to focus on expanded checks in Irish ports, as well as an increase in veterinary checks. The rationale underlying this approach, sources said, is that despite the continuing impasse over the Northern Ireland backstop, a deal is still possible. Setting out “fixes” for a no-deal scenario would not be considered helpful to the discussions, as it would create “hostages to fortunes” to be seized upon by those unhappy with the withdrawal agreement, one source said. The commission has been holding seminars on key sectors for all 27 member states since the middle of November on issues such as financial services, intellectual property, company law and consumer protection, transportation and customs. Once the round of briefings has concluded in mid-January, the commission is expected to publish a large tranche of papers outlining the full scope of its response to the post-Brexit situation. At its Cabinet meeting last Tuesday, the Government moved its default planning mode from a “central case” scenario – where the UK left with a deal – to a no-deal case. Departments will have to move more quickly to put their contingencies in place because in that scenario there will be no transition or buffer period after March 29th. Fianna Fáil Brexit spokeswoman Lisa Chambers criticised the lack of information disclosed by the Government on a no-deal situation and suggested its planning could be lagging behind. “We need to fast-track our responses. I have been asking the Tánaiste for weeks to come before the possibilities but he has not done so,” she said. “What is ‘Plan B’? What are we going to do if there’s a hard Brexit?”A Government spokesman said most focus would be on Brussels over the coming week, revolving on talks about clarification on the “backstop” between EU and UK officials. “Irish officials will of course be consulted but the discussions are between the EU and London,” said the spokesman. A General Affairs Council meeting of foreign ministers has been scheduled for Wednesday with a view to discussing article 50, which provides the mechanism to give legal effect to the Brexit decision. However, the meeting looked less likely to happen as of Sunday night because of the political impasse. Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It is to his credit that he managed to put a brave face on things when he addressed the Dáil on Wednesday afternoon and then somehow found the strength to follow this up with a media briefing on the plinth.One can only image the maelstrom of emotions swirling around Micheál’s head as he contemplated the devastating letter he received the night before from Marc MacSharry, Fianna Fáil’s bumptious baritone of the backbenches.Having launched his missive, MacSharry circulated it to a number of colleagues.We cannot reproduce all of it, because it’s Christmas and the newspaper can’t bear another supplement.Micheál blood will have run cold when he read the ominous opening paragraph of the 780-word communication.Marc goes on to say that continuing with the confidence-and-supply arrangement will make the party irrelevant. “An extension of even a day is an endorsement of the last 3 years with all its flaws and scandals. We cannot propose any real policy different to FG for fear of precipitating a crisis and or election, we shuffle between 4 and 8 behind them in opinion polls depending exclusively on the sum of the efforts in ground hurling by our TDs candidates, senators and Cllr’s to stay in the game but the common perception now is there is no tangible difference between us. We have morphed into FG in the public conscience.”Had the party gone for “national government rather than coalition” in 2016, he believed Micheál would be Taoiseach now.“Granted my Effrontery in going solo at the time is one of the probable many reasons for my exclusion since but look that ship has sailed. I was right though. The Brexit cover story is a red herring.”The Sligo TD points out that elections have continued throughout Europe despite Brexit and he feels an extension of article 50 beyond March “is certainly likely”. Meanwhile, the country is close to full employment and the housing and health crises need to be addressed.“The point here is we risk more permanent damage to the party by staying in,” he tells Micheál. “Staying in buys time but for what ?? More time to become even less relevant?? How and when do we get our policy out there. How do beat them up on policy ??”And when will the leadership seek more input and share information with the rest of the party?“We need unity of course but as I said before Unity flows from shared ownership. You have worked harder than any leader ever and you deserve to be Taoiseach more than any of them. Please do not renew this .Thanks for reading. Marc.”He’ll not last the year, at this rate. And he’s not the only one.Can a heave, or a split, be far off?A sweet little story this week from Leinster House as the Dáil prepares to rise for the Christmas break.It concerns American student Maeve Price, one of a group of overseas interns who have just completed a semester working with Irish parliamentarians. The programme is organised by the Institute of Public Administration.Maeve, who is studying education and communication at Denison University in Ohio, was assigned to the office of the Fianna Fáil TD for Meath East, Thomas Byrne.She told him about her parents, John and Patricia, who eloped to Sligo in 1993 and were married in Rosses Point. It wasn’t a total surprise to their folks in New Jersey, because the young couple became engaged in August of that year before they decided to make a break for Ireland and tie the knot in Yeats country.They had ties to the west of Ireland – their great-grandparents came from Galway and Mayo – and John was a great admirer of WB’s poetry.And so, with help from a priest back home, who contacted Msgr Jennings and Sr Joseph in Rosses Point, a wedding was organised. Locals pitched in with help when they heard the story and two teenagers, brother and sister Frank and Carina Mitchell, were drafted in as best man and maid of honour.Fast forward a quarter of a century, and Maeve is on a call to her mom back home in Jersey. She mentions that Thomas Byrne is a solicitor who also qualified for the New York bar. This was a co-incidence as her brother Jack is currently studying for the New York bar.“Then mom remembered that Frank told her he was going to study law. She said to me: “Just ask Thomas if he knows Frank,” Maeve recalls, adding that Ireland may be a small place, but not that small.“It was so random that my mom thought to even ask Thomas. So I brought up the name and then I showed him the picture.”Thomas Byrne says he looked at the photograph and thought: “My God, I know him.” They had studied law together in Trinity College. “I called him up in the Law Library and he remembered straight away.”Maeve completed her stint in Leinster House this week and on Thursday night she and her brother Jack had dinner in Dublin with barrister (and best man) Frank Mitchell BL.Veteran Fianna Fáil senator, Terry Leyden, caused consternation among female senators on Thursday evening during the final hours of debate before the abortion Bill was passed into law.Leyden, in a confusing contribution which had senators – along with the Minister for Health – exhorting him to actually read the section of the legislation he was pronouncing upon, said he was proud to have supported the Eighth Amendment 35 years ago. “And people seem to forget this point: this was voted by 140 Members of Dáil Éireann and it was put into the Constitution”.He then began reading the amendment. “The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and with due regard...”As a chorus of female voices told him his point wasn’t relevant and he was loudly reminded that 1.4 million people voted in May to remove the same amendment, Lynn Ruane shouted at Leyden: “Gone! Repealed! It doesn’t exist.”He turned, looked in her direction and countered “Don’t get so emotional.”Then Terry took grave umbrage at charges that his comment was misogynistic. “I’m not referring to any sex . . . I see more emotion here with David Norris than I do for any of you,” he told the women, withdrawing his remark if it had offended anyone.There then followed a most curious exchange of words.Senator Leyden appeals to the chair, claiming he is being shouted down. “In fairness now, you have to admit that they’re really coming on top of me here at the moment now, big time. In fairness now.”“We’ll get the violins out,” shrugs Lynn Ruane.“Don’t get emotional, Terry,” smiles Ivana Bacik.“There is nobody coming on top of you, I can guarantee you that,” declares Marie-Louise O’Donnell, with an even bigger smile.David Norris isn’t going to be left out. “I’d need to be more emotional than I am to get on top of you.”Brian O’Domhnaill, sitting behind Terry, is grinning away as the sound of chortling senators fills the chamber.Terry looks to the chair again. “Sorry, cathaorleach, you’ll have to, kind of, delete some of these comments which I think are very unsuitable, actually.”We are making no comment on the above. Just leaving it out there.And to think, we almost abolished the Upper House.It was a female first for Irish politics in the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin on Wednesday evening when four distinguished politicians spoke from the same platform for the first time in their long careers. They also recorded another first when they sat together for a photograph.Frances Fitzgerald, Joan Burton, Mary Harney and Mary Coughlan joined historian and broadcaster David McCullagh to talk politics and their careers at an event to mark the centenary of womens’ suffrage.“The Four Tánaistí” went down a storm with the audience.Perhaps they should consider going on tour.So here we are, sitting comfortably at home in Ireland and watching the carry-on in Paris with the gilets jaunes and the anti-Macron protests.Members of the Kildare Street and University Club on St Stephen’s Green – quite a few senior civil servants among them – were aghast at a certain piece of news emailed to them during the week.Under an atmospheric blue-skies photo of a field in France, near a distant chateau, with two bottles of wine and a large glass of claret resting on the fertile soil beside a bunch of grapes, was this alarming “Club Notice”: “Members please note that due to the riots currently in France, the Club is finding it difficult to maintain levels of our French wines at present.”They must be bathing in the stuff.Another notice also caught our eye this week. Or, more precisely, the eye of our man in Brussels, Paddy Smyth.At lunchtime on Wednesday, as Downing Street’s damage limitation machine went into overdrive and Westminster went into meltdown over that evening’s vote of confidence in Theresa May, an email landed.Subject? “Merry Christmas from No 10”.And inside, a nicely lit night-time photograph of that famous front door, with the Christmas tree twinkling and a festive wreath handing from the letterbox with the message: “Best wishes for Christmas and New Year.”Life goes on, no matter who is PM or who resides in number 10."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3733389.1544996539!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit second referendum would further divide uk may to tell commons","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May is to say on Monday: ‘Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.’ Photographer: Jasper JuinenBloombergA second referendum on Brexit would ide Britain further and damage beyond repair the integrity of its politics, Theresa May will tell the House of Commons on Tuesday. But with no majority for the prime minister’s Brexit deal, a number of cabinet ministers have suggested that MPs should have an “indicative vote” on alternative options.Downing Street on Sunday dismissed reports that some of Mrs May’s most senior aides were consulting with opposition MPs on the prospect of a second referendum. And in a statement on Monday about last week’s EU summit, the prime minister will argue that a second vote would betray the 2016 referendum.“Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum. Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it,” she will say.EU leaders last week rejected Mrs May’s request for a legally binding assurance about the temporary nature of the Northern Ireland backstop. They said the legally binding withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop, cannot be renegotiated but left open the option of a further clarification of its meaning.The prime minister last week postponed a vote on the Brexit deal because it faced certain defeat as Conservative Brexiteers and the DUP have said they will join opposition MPs to vote against it. International trade secretary Liam Fox on Sunday became the first Brexiteer in Mrs May’s cabinet to endorse an indicative vote by MPs on a range of Brexit options.“Personally I wouldn’t have a huge problem with parliament as a whole having a say on what the options were. When you look at the options that we have, we have got to recognise that there are a limited number of real world options here,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.Education secretary Damian Hinds said he was open to “flushing out” different options in Parliament, a proposal that has the support of a number of Remainer cabinet ministers. The alternatives to Mrs May’s deal most discussed at Westminster are “Norway-plus”, which would keep Britain in the single market and the customs union a second referendum or leaving the EU without a deal.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who campaigned against Brexit in the 2016 referendum, said on Sunday that Britain would flourish even if it left with no deal. In an interview with the Sunday , he said he would like to succeed Mrs May as prime minister after she has navigated Brexit through the next few months.“I think every MP has a corner of their heart that says they would like to have a crack at the top job. I’m no different. But I think the first thing is to get us through this challenging next few months and I passionately believe Theresa May is the right person to do that,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website.

The bin is lifted onto the vehicle and given a thorough shake in order to get all of the rubbish out.If the resident has compacted their rubbish to such an extent that some has become wedged in, or put something in that has prevented other rubbish from coming out, it is their responsibility to resolve this so that the collection can take place on the next occasion.The bin crews have rounds to complete and it is not practical for them to take a stick and prod away at someone\u0027s rubbish to try and loosen it up each time it has been compacted in so tightly at the bottom of the bin.Please review our commenting policyGolf club faces investigation after cutting down protected trees to improve the views of a lakeHS2 bosses misled Parliament over the estimated cost of the project, whistle-blower revealsCold calls crackdown will mean fewer unsolicited telephone calls for households, government pledges Teachers being driven out of profession by disruptive pupils, major report saysTribunal fines to be quadrupled under Government overhaul of workers\u0026#39 rights announced by Greg ClarkThe Apprentice final, review: Sian Gabbidon won but will anyone remember her name past the closing credits?Alexander Armstrong’s Best Christmas Ever, review: a guilty pleasure that charmed no endComment: This babble about a \u0026#39People\u0026#39s Vote\u0026#39 undermines our credibility and treats people with contempt Theresa May faces Cabinet split over no-deal Brexit as ministers warn that they are prepared to quitBoris Johnson warns public would feel betrayed by second Brexit referendumFood safety experts warn  fruit and vegetables sold in British shops could contain potentially deadly norovirusBoy, 5, is third to die following house fire that killed his mother and sisterNHS to offer mature students £5k to become mental health nurses Brazilian faith healer accused of sexually assaulting 300 women turns himself inFifth Strasbourg terror victim dies as city holds emotional memorialComment: Sometimes, the best Christmas food is what comes out of the leftovers NHS guidance is airbrushing \u0026#39fathers\u0026#39 out of parenting, claims think tankJoe Biden tops key 2020 poll as he mulls whether he is too old to run for presidentColin Kroll, HQ Trivia creator, found dead at his New York apartmentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nations overcome last minute divisions forge climate deal","story":"Nearly 200 countries overcame political isions late on Saturday to agree rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, but critics say it is not ambitious enough to prevent the dangerous effects of global warming.Eleventh hour disagreements over carbon markets almost derailed negotiations and delayed a final agreement by a day.In the end it took two weeks of talks in the Polish city of Katowice to turn the aim of the Paris accord - limiting global temperature rises to well below 2C - into a more detailed framework.It is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. Through this package you have made a thousand little steps forward together. You can feel proud, Michal Kurtyka, the Polish president of the talks told delegates.After he struck the gavel to signal agreement, ministers joined him on the stage, hugging and laughing in signs of relief after the marathon talks.Michal Kurtyka, who led climate talks in Katowice, Poland, shows his relief as an agreement is reached after marathon negotiationsEven before negotiators convened, many expected the deal would not be as robust as needed. President Donald Trump has already announced his intention to pull his country - one of the world\u0027s biggest emitters - out of the pact.At the 11th hour, ministers managed to break a deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the accounting rules for the monitoring of carbon credits, deferring the bulk of that discussion to next year, but missing an opportunity to send a signal to businesses to speed up their actions.Still, exhausted ministers managed to bridge a series of ides to produce a 156-page rulebook - which is broken down into themes such as how countries will report and monitor their national pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions and update their emissions plans.It allows flexibility for poorer nations, which claim they suffer greater impacts of rising temperatures triggered by more developed countries.But richer nations have long rejected the idea of being legally liable for climate change.As a result, several ministers conceded there was more work to be done but held out the framework as important progress.sites under threat from climate changeWhile some rulebook elements still need to be fleshed out, it is a foundation for strengthening the Paris Agreement and could help facilitate US re-entry into the Paris Agreement by a future presidential administration, said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.Some countries and green groups criticised the outcome for failing to urge increased ambitions on emissions cuts sufficiently to curb rising temperatures. Poorer nations vulnerable to climate change also wanted more clarity on how an already agreed $100 billion a year of climate finance by 2020 will be provided and on efforts to build on that amount further from the end of the decade.A statement by António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, who left the talks on Thursday, stressed the need for more work.From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition, it said.And ambition must guide all member states as they prepare their (emissions cut plans) for 2020 to reverse the present trend in which climate change is still running faster than us.A UN-commissioned report by the IPCC in October warned that keeping the Earth\u0027s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C would need unprecedented changes in every aspect of society.Last week, Saudi Arabia, the Unites States, Russia and Kuwait refused to use the word welcome in association with the findings of the report.The decision text now merely expresses gratitude for the work on the report, welcomes its timely completion and invites parties to use the information in it.Please review our commenting policyGolf club faces investigation after cutting down protected trees to improve the views of a lakeHS2 bosses misled Parliament over the estimated cost of the project, whistle-blower revealsCold calls crackdown will mean fewer unsolicited telephone calls for households, government pledges Teachers being driven out of profession by disruptive pupils, major report saysTribunal fines to be quadrupled under Government overhaul of workers\u0026#39 rights announced by Greg ClarkThe Apprentice final, review: Sian Gabbidon won but will anyone remember her name past the closing credits?Alexander Armstrong’s Best Christmas Ever, review: a guilty pleasure that charmed no endComment: This babble about a \u0026#39People\u0026#39s Vote\u0026#39 undermines our credibility and treats people with contempt Theresa May faces Cabinet split over no-deal Brexit as ministers warn that they are prepared to quitBoris Johnson warns public would feel betrayed by second Brexit referendumFood safety experts warn  fruit and vegetables sold in British shops could contain potentially deadly norovirusBoy, 5, is third to die following house fire that killed his mother and sisterNHS to offer mature students £5k to become mental health nurses Brazilian faith healer accused of sexually assaulting 300 women turns himself inFifth Strasbourg terror victim dies as city holds emotional memorialComment: Sometimes, the best Christmas food is what comes out of the leftovers NHS guidance is airbrushing \u0026#39fathers\u0026#39 out of parenting, claims think tankJoe Biden tops key 2020 poll as he mulls whether he is too old to run for presidentColin Kroll, HQ Trivia creator, found dead at his New York apartmentWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/15/TELEMMGLPICT000183444061_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwQ40NZzMzMoMNeFa8NnNtcQ.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"old going join yoloaps","story":"Roger and Susan Clarke were arrested in Lisbon for attempting to smuggle cocaine aboard a cruise-liner. When I heard that two British pensioners had been arrested in Lisbon for attempting to smuggle £2 million worth of cocaine on a Caribbean cruise ship last week, it was a reminder that the Hoary Hooligan has been with us for a while now those incorrigible codgers determined not to go gently into that good night but preferring to have a good night out instead – the YOLOAPs.They can be headstrong but harmless, like the heroine of Jenny Joseph’s Warning (“When I am an old woman I shall wear purpleWith a red hat which doesn’t go, and doesn’t suit meAnd I shall spend my pension on brandy and summer gloves…”) or the notorious Skis (Spending Kids’ Inheritance), the over-60s with collective assets...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

That Mike Ashley. Has the FT taken leave of its senses? The same title that exposed the scandal of the macho bad behaviour surrounding the Presidents Club dinner now praising the business boss who vomited into a fireplace after consuming 12 pints in a pub during a management meeting?Actually, the FT is right. The source of the applause was the memo Ashley sent to the Debenhams board, expressing anger at their refusal of a £40m interest-free loan and equity injection from his Sports Direct chain, the department store group’s biggest shareholder. In no uncertain terms, Ashley maps out the lie of the land for the Debenhams directors. It’s not pretty: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory the market is saying Debenhams has no credit insurance advisers and banks are telling suppliers they should not trade with the firm at a level above which they can afford to lose suppliers are managing themselves out of stores product is being discounted to try and realise some cash.” And, says Ashley, with a final flourish: “Additionally, it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Sports Direct boss issues warning to Debenhams in leaked letterCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisPhew. That’s telling them. And that’s the point. Because too few senior business people tell it how it is, for fear of provoking upset and spoiling relationships. Too many of their advisers seek to please, not help. The result is that they carry on existing in a bubble. Decisions that should be taken aren’t, boards do not confront reality, and instead, carry on their sweet way. Opportunities to act, to do something, are lost, with the result that when the C-suite does decide to move it’s often too late. For injecting a dose of reality into proceedings, and, hopefully, making the Debenhams top brass sit up and see sense, Ashley deserves much credit. At the very least, they cannot maintain they were not made aware. His straight-talking is commendable and authoritative – Ashley, don’t forget, is immersed in retail, and is grappling on a daily basis with the same landscape that is confronting Debenhams.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursuedIt’s Ashley as well, as the head of an empire that along with Sports Direct includes lingerie firm Agent Provocateur, Evans Cycles, luxury fashion chain Flannels, the House of Fraser department stores, and major holdings in Debenhams and French Connection, who is warning loudly about the dire future facing the high street. Rising rents and growing popularity of online shopping paint a bleak prospect, one that he says could be improved by a tax on firms who generate 20 per cent of their revenues from the internet.As with Debenhams, Ashley does not pull his punches, telling MPs, the high street is heading for extinction\u0026nbspunless radical action was taken and warning them: “I’m not Father Christmas.”I never imagined I’d write this: we need more Mike Ashleys. Not the bad boy Ashley, but the one who is prepared to speak out, to stand up and to be counted.What’s striking is just how few major retailers are prepared to voice their fears and frustrations. We’re entering a season of renewed woe in the industry, of yet more dismal sets of results and closures – but the silence, the sense of inertia, will be resounding.In private, they’re all complaining and moaning like mad. But, hidebound by conservatism, afraid of rocking the boat, of drawing attention to themselves and somehow being seen as in trouble, they’re saying very little in public.The result is that it’s not just the directors of Debenhams who are able to kid themselves, but trade associations, industry organisations, MPs, media, councils, landlords, trade unions. They, along with the retailers, should all be campaigning to save our high streets, highlighting the imbalance between digital and bricks and mortar, pointing up the ridiculous nature of the business rates system, stating categorically that thousands of jobs are going to perish – not to mention the knock-on effects to communities.There’s a bit of noise, but it’s scattergun, and nowhere near concerted or loud enough. The fact it’s fallen to Ashley to say something, speaks volumes.All credit to him, though. Of course he’s got a vested interest, as he has in Debenhams. But if he does not protest, who will? Hopefully, the directors of Debenhams will wake up, along with the MPs he was addressing.It would be disastrous if the time-honoured establishment reaction to the likes of Ashley, of labelling him as an upstart, as someone not to be taken seriously, was pursued. The time for retreating into the bunker, and hoping the danger will pass, has gone. The Debenhams board must act, and act now. Likewise, where the broader state of the high street is concerned, we need action and we need it now. Mike Ashley, a saviour. Who would have thought it?

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

Newtownabbey, Co Antrim“Some argue it is actually increasing in intensity,” astronomy blogger Dave\u0026nbspSamuhel\u0026nbsptold the website.The key to the\u0026nbspGeminids’ consistency is the celestial object that has triggered the meteor shower each year since the\u0026nbsp1800s, which orbits the Sun every 550 days or so.3. It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

None other than Gee Roberson, who counted West among his clients at the time.This appears to be the moment West and Drake\u0027s paths started to cross – the inciting incident, perhaps, of the soap opera of their lives.It might be hard to believe today, but there was once a time when Drake and West heaped praise on each other publicly.That was the year West said Drake had one of the best lines of the year on his song\u0026nbspEvery Girl.Drake, meanwhile, called West the most influential musician in his life in an interview with\u0026nbspMTV.2009 was also the year West and Drake met in Hawaii, and the year they were both featured on a remix of Jamie Foxx\u0027s\u0026nbspDigital Girl.2010: Trouble in paradiseFind Your Love,\u0026nbspa Drake song co-written and co-produced by West, was released in May 2010. A good sign, surely?Well, not exactly – West said in 2013 that he was fine working on the track until Drake got too big.In September of that year, Drake was spotted with Amber Rose – then West\u0027s recent ex, which many believe contributed to their discord.2011 will go down in beef history as the year Drake told\u0026nbspThe Source\u0026nbspabout West:\u0026nbsp“My goal is to surpass everything he’s accomplished. I don’t want to be as good as Kanye, I want to be better.”In December of that year, Drizzy appeared to confirm he was coming for West\u0027s crown\u0026nbspby rapping on DJ Khaled\u0027s\u0026nbspI\u0027m On One: I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking  Watch me take it.2013: Drake acknowledges the elephant in the roomMe and Ye just fell into this thing where we hadn’t actually talked to each other in so long that all this stuff got built up, Drake told\u0026nbspBillboard\u0026nbspthat year.Sometimes you just have to find the opportunity to tell someone that you really like and respect them. After that, everything can move forward.Rolling Stone\u0026nbspreaders gasped when Drake was quoted as dissing\u0026nbspWest\u0027s album\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin these terms: There were some real questionable bars on thereLike that ‘Swaghili’ line? Come on, man. Even Fabolous wouldn’t say some s*** like that.Drake promptly said on Twitter he never commented on\u0026nbspYeezus\u0026nbspin the interview.West was later quoted as supporting Drake during his tours, saying magazines were trying to pit n***** against each other.\u0026nbspBig Sean\u0027s\u0026nbspBlessings, on which West and Drake both feature, came out in January 2015, inaugurating what is remembered as one of the more positive years of the West  Drake timeline.In February 2015, West teased the possibility of doing an album with Drake in the future.That same month, Drake brought West onstage during one of his shows.Created with Sketch.Albums of the year 2018 Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

In it, he responds to Pusha T, with whom Drake is involved in a separate feud.\u0026nbspPusha T had accused Drake of resorting to ghostwriters. In turn, Drake implied in the lyrics of\u0026nbspDuppy Freestyle\u0026nbsphe had ghostwritten for West, the founder of Pusha\u0026nbspT\u0027s label GOOD Music.Things escalated until September, when Drake appeared to diss\u0026nbspWest\u0027s Yeezy 350 sneakers in a collaboration with French Montana, writing: Keeping it G, I told her don’t wear no 350s around me.Instead of fighting back, West addressed Drake in a series of tweets apologising for various things, writing at one point: There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you.All of this brings us to December 2018 and West\u0027s most recent tweetstorm, which appeared to have been triggered by a clearance request from Drake regarding his own song\u0026nbspSay What\u0027s Real, which features a sample by West.West tweeted a screenshot of a request before firing off many tweets about Drake, at one point claiming Drake had threatened him during a phone call.His wife Kim Kardashian chimed in, writing:\u0026nbsp@drake Never threaten my husband or our family. He paved the way for their to be a Drake.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.The UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chester Zoo after a fire broke out in the Monsoon Forest habitat area.Fracking has been halted at the Preston Road site in Lancashire after a series of tremors peaking at 0.9 magnitudeIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today told Theresa May that he expects assurances that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandTheresa May announces that she is to face a vote of no confidence todayArmed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a new book points out, it’s an essentially selfish state of being, and society should stop chasing this illusion because it’ll only make us miserable. Even if you do own an orgasmatron...Click to followThe IndependentSurfing is similar to happiness: it’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means it is devoid of any moralityThomas Jefferson made it a constitutional right in the US. “The pursuit of happiness.”\u0026nbspYou have the right to pursue wellbeing. No one is stopping you. Go ahead and pursue it. But when did a right morph into an obligation, a duty?The founding fathers were influenced by the great voyages of discovery. Thanks to Captain Cook and his French counterpart Bougainville, the idea got about that everyone in the southern hemisphere was happier than in the cold and dismal north. We had the technology, we had the “civilisation”, but why didn’t we feel good about it? They had something we were lacking. Surfing was a case in point. According to European observers, the men and women riding waves had found a way to “allay all perturbation of mind”. The American constitution was, in effect, suggesting we ought to try living our lives on the crest of a wave.I personally put the utopian theory to the test by following in Cook’s footsteps and going to the Sandwich Islands, aka Hawaii, aka “the Happy Isles of Oceania” (according to Paul Theroux). By a strange quirk of fate one of the first people I met there was a clinical psychologist. “Where are you from?”, she said. “England,” I replied. “You’re so lucky!” she said. I had just travelled several thousand miles to get away from England and here was someone telling me I was better off saving my money and staying put. “How do you work that out?” I asked. “The great thing about England,” she replied, “is that you can be miserable and nobody minds. In fact you’re expected to be miserable.”It turned out that she was a specialist in treating people with depression. “In Hawaii?” I said with genuine scepticism. They have palm trees, sultry breezes, and big waves, what was the problem? “People get depressed in Hawaii the same as anywhere else,” she said. “The problem is that here you’re expected to be happy. So you feel guilty about it on top. And then considering Hawaii is also technically the 50th state of America, if you’re broke too, when you’re supposed to be prosperous, then you’re really screwed.”You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for youDr Depression surely had a point. But she represents the opposition to what has become increasingly a vast and powerful and highly profitable industry, as Carl Cederström sets out in his wise and witty new book, The Happiness Fantasy. He might equally well have called it the “happiness conspiracy”, because we are being ganged up on, bullied and battered and bruised by the imperative of happiness. Can’t we just be unhappy if we feel like it? What’s so bad about that?I know I’m going to come over as the biggest party pooper, grouch or grinch in the history of the world here, but I can never really sing “Happy Birthday” to anyone with any degree of conviction or enthusiasm. I do still occasionally send birthday cards, but I’m not going to write the words “happy birthday” in black and white. It always seems too coercive to me. My attitude is OK, be happy if you like, but if you want to be unhappy that’s good too, you shouldn’t have to feel like you have to be happy. Happiness ought to be voluntary and accidental and spontaneous and strictly optional. (So what do I write? “Be awesome”? It’s tricky. Suggestions on a postcard, please.)TherouxCederström comes from Stockholm. He is more of an exponent of Nordic noir. No palm trees in Scandi-land, so far as I know. Only bracing, even lacerating minimalism. Don’t get me wrong. Cederström is not advocating despair. Maybe he is even trying to save you from Hawaiian-style depression. You don’t have to be miserable, but it’s your constitutional right to be downhearted if you want to be. What he demonstrates so convincingly is how feeling good can really be bad for you.According to Philip Larkin, sex was invented – or at least re-invented – sometime between the publication of Lady Chatterley’s Lover and the Beatles’ first LP, around 1963. “Happiness,” as Freud said, “comes from the satisfaction of needs that have been dammed up to a high degree.” But what if they are not dammed up? Then we are looking at futile or self-destructive overexertion. Instead of being an episodic phenomenon, sex turned into our lodestar, our archetype of mood-management. Thanks in part to Wilhelm Reich, the orgasm was no longer an exceptional high, it became the model of how we were ought to be feeling generally. Way up there on Cloud 9. Average was no longer good enough. But the idea that everyone should really be feeling well beyond average all the time – having constant “peak experiences” (in Abraham Maslow’s phrase) meant that there was always going to be lot of disappointed customers.Reich was an Austrian, originally a disciple of Freud’s, who broke with him over Freud’s notion of sublimation. Civilisation, said Freud, depends on you bottling up all that libinidal energy of yours, and channelling it into doing something creative, like writing novels, composing symphonies or building bridges and tall buildings. Rubbish, said Reich. The orgasm (no ordinary orgasm moreover, it has to be “full”) – that rapturous release of endorphins and assorted chemicals – is good for you. What we need is more actual orgasms. Thus was the Age of Aquarius born, ie the Sixties, marking an end to the long, grim era of repression. Reich invented the “orgone accumulator”, which became the “orgasmatron” in Woody Allen’s Sleeper. He was eventually arrested for fraud, locked up, and died in prison in the US, aged 60, a martyr to sexual liberationBut this was only the beginning of the happiness industry, branching out into “human potential”, “self-help”, “positive thinking”, and New Age gurus, even Scientology, all of them packaged and purveyed and pharmaceutically-inflected. If you’re feeling blue, why not pop a pill? It’s your constitutional right. Especially if it might make you more productive or more “authentic”. We have ended up in a situation where no one feels they are really getting enough, of just about anything. And we are “depraved on account of being deprived” as they say in West Side Story.Cederström is the co-author, with André Spicer, of The Wellness Syndrome, and together they wrote Desperately Seeking Self-Improvement. He puts me in mind of that bloke in Boswell’s Life of Johnson who says, “I tried to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness kept breaking through.” I couldn’t resist asking Cederström if he considered himself a happy sort of guy. He said that he thought the word itself was now effectively meaningless, as per the passage from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot:Godot, Alfred Lynch plays\u0026nbspEstragon (left) and Nicol Williamson is Vladimir (Rex)Vladimir: Say you are, even if it’s not true.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​What am I to say?Vladimir: Say, I am happy.\u0026nbspEstragon: ​We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?\u0026nbspCederström reckons that “the whole self-actualisation craze had a purpose when it kicked off, in the Sixties, as a reaction against the hyper-patriarchal image of the happy family life with the ‘happy’ housewife and all the rest”. But he clearly thinks that the concept has long outlived its usefulness and is now being sold as a contemporary form of snake oil.The thing about happiness is that it should happen to you accidentally. You can only be happy until the moment where you start asking yourself the killer question, “Am I really happy?” And then it all falls apart. Hence all the hype and hysteria and desperation around happiness is entirely self-defeating. Happiness underwent a period of massive inflation in the 20th century. Maybe we have reached the point where the bottom has fallen out of the market finally and we need to rethink happiness from the ground up.I think the Greeks had a good idea in “ataraxia”. They didn’t think of the orgasm as the be-all and end-all. The point about ataraxia is that you are neither feeling particularly good nor particularly bad, but have attained a neutral state – a kind of degree zero – in which your desires give you a break for a time. Rather than maximum gratification we are looking at the minimisation of regret.As someone suggested to me the other day, happiness equals reality minus expectations. I think stoicism is superior to mere happiness because it allows that there is and there will be suffering in the world and the best you can hope for is to be able to adjust your attitude towards it. As Epicurus says, when you drop your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces no one expects you be jumping for joy. But you might be able (with a truly heroic effort) be able to say to yourself, “The vase has been restored.”The other problem with happiness is, oddly enough, the same problem that affects surfing. It’s an essentially selfish state of being. It’s all about feeling good within yourself. It’s an internal, physiological and emotional state. Which means, in effect, that it is devoid of any morality. Harvey Weinstein was just trying to be happy too. Pursuing his democratic rights.We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they\u0026nbsparen’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone elseCarl Cederström sees Donald Trump as the ultimate flowering of the human potential movement. Even the president speaks of “tapping human potential”. Just as, at the same time, he speaks of “grabbing pussy” or celebrating the NRA. Happiness, as John Lennon said, “is a warm gun”. That’s my constitutional right too. Which has become practically synonymous with a lack of impulse control. I enjoy having a drink, don’t I? Or a big fat cheeseburger. So isn’t it my right to go on eating and drinking myself to death? I want to feel good, even if that way perdition lies (not to mention diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver). As the actor Philip Seymour Hoffman once said (before OD’ing on heroin), “There is no pleasure I haven’t actually made myself sick on.” Cederström himself recalls anything but fondly a week of limitless hedonistic excess in the Canary Islands, leading to an all-time hangover.Happiness, in any case, is largely an illusion. We tend to think of other people as being or at least looking happy. And definitely happier than ourselves. The fact is they aren’t, we just think they are. All those blissfully smiling beautiful people – they’re just as screwed up as everyone else. Social media only serves to spread the delusion. I once asked my son, who was supposed to be studying at university at the time, if his life was constant partying. “Why would you think that?” He asked. “Because all I see of you on Facebook is pictures of you dancing or getting drunk at parties.” He scoffed at my naivety. “That’s only because no one ever posts pictures of themselves sitting at the library and reading a book or writing an essay.”Happiness is a myth that only serves the interests of the happiness-conjurors and the manufacturers of birthday cards. I think happiness has now entered its twilight zone. I can’t see feeling good being of any intrinsic value unless it is also coupled to doing good. Aristotle had something like this in mind when he defined happiness (or eudaimonia) as leading a virtuous life. I think this is what Cederström is hoping for in the future when he speaks of “collective happiness”.But there is another issue here: just as happiness can dissolve into a kind of self-satisfaction, having one’s fellow humans in mind is only another kind of narcissism at the level of the species. One of the most ecstatic non-anthropocentric moments I can recall is when I was cycling through a park and a small bird – a sparrow, I think – came flying out of a bush straight out at me, but seeing me in the way, turned at right angles so that – for the space of a second or two – the bird was flying at exactly the height of my head and at the same speed I was cycling. With the effect that we (if I can speak of “we”, the bird and me) briefly flew along together. That was years ago and I can still feel something of what it must feel like to be a bird. It was exceptional and aleatory and probably unrepeatable. But perhaps the oceanic feeling that Freud was so sceptical of – the sense of there being “an indissoluble bond” with the universe – needs to make a comeback.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’Carl Cederström’s book, ‘The Happiness Fantasy’, is published by PolityShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

As much as 95 per cent of marine species, and 70 per cent of life on the land, perished as a result.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn an interview with The Independent in their offices at the University of Washington, associate professor Curtis Deutsch and co-author Justin Penn, said the reaction to their paper in Science had been a mixture of excitement and fear - excitement at the discovery and fear of the prescient dangers if people did not act.“I think this work has identified the leading factor in what led to the largest crisis in the history of life on earth,” said Mr Penn, a doctoral student, asked how he hoped policy makers would respond to the discovery.“The hopeful message is that despite doing do, it also identifies the solution to that problem - which is the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. So my hope is we decide to do something about it.”The scientists based their discovery about the Permian period on computer modelling and calculations that took months. They also made use of information provided by chemical changes in the fossils of eel-like creatures more than 250m years old to show the extent of temperature change.It had previously been known the mass extinction was triggered after a succession of huge volcanic eruptions in what is now Siberia. While loss of life was linked to a surge in the release of greenhouse gases, it was not previously understood what made the oceans so inimical to life.“This is the first time that we have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused the extinction that can be directly tested with the fossil record, which then allows us to make predictions about the causes of extinction in the future,” Mr Penn wrote of their discovery, pointing out that the situation they examined 250m years ago, with the presence of increased levels of greenhouse gases and warming oceans, was similar to today.“Under a business-as-usual emissions scenarios, by 2100 warming in the upper ocean will have approached 20 percent of warming in the late Permian, and by the year 2300 it will reach between 35 and 50 per cent. This study highlights the potential for a mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism under anthropogenic climate change.”Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Firefighters work on site where a large explosion occurred at a restaurant in Sapporo.

Those in the North East were by far the most likely to feel this way, with 24 per cent expecting to get into debt.Young mothers were more likely to be in a difficult financial situation than young fathers, at 40 per cent compared to 29 per cent. The Trust said this could be\u0026nbspbecause women are more likely than young men to be jobless or trapped in low-paid or insecure work.The two sets of research come\u0026nbspafter the\u0026nbspUnited Nations condemned\u0026nbspthe government’s “punitive, mean-spirited and often callous” treatment of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable.The UN poverty rapporteur Philip\u0026nbspAlston\u0026nbspsaid he had been concerned to see families dependent on food banks, and children who were “growing up in poverty unsure of their future”.UN condemns ‘callous’ UK government in damning poverty reportResponding to the new findings, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner\u0026nbspsaid: “These figures paint a shocking picture of the impact of the Tories’ austerity programme on a generation of children, who are impoverished through no fault of their own.“Growing up in such hardship has a major influence on education, health and welfare, and quite simply it is harder to learn if you are hungry or homeless.”Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said the figures painted a “Dickensian picture of the poverty that far too many children and their families are having to endure”.\u0026nbspShe added: “The government is out of touch with the distressing new reality of children’s daily lives: with what it means to live without enough money for basics, such as food, shoes and adequate clothing.\u0026nbsp“The government has failed to recognise the human cost of its cuts to schools and other children’s services and to the social security system, and its failure to address the in-work poverty faced by one in five workers.“The government must stop hiding from the facts. Children can’t escape the poverty trap without an urgent change to national policies.”Young Women’s Trust chief executive Dr Carole Easton said: “Christmas is a particularly hard time for those on low pay who want to provide for their families.“Young women are more likely to be stuck on low pay and on zero hours contracts. Often they don’t know how many hours they will work each month and whether they will earn enough to pay their bills.\u0026nbsp“Much more needs to be done to improve young people’s prospects. This means giving them the right skills and support to find jobs, ensuring decent and flexible jobs are available and paying a proper living wage that doesn’t discriminate against age. This would benefit businesses and the economy too.”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May has hit out at Mr Blair, accusing him of insultingthe British people and the office of prime minister by undermining Brexit talks with calls in Brussels for a second referendum.Chester Zoo after a fire broke out in the Monsoon Forest habitat area.Fracking has been halted at the Preston Road site in Lancashire after a series of tremors peaking at 0.9 magnitudeIrish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar today told Theresa May that he expects assurances that there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of IrelandTheresa May announces that she is to face a vote of no confidence todayArmed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Today, only 24 per cent of Leave voters say it would make Britain economically stronger, while 26 per cent say it would make the nation weaker.Amanda Chetwynd-Cowieson, co-founder of campaign group For our Future’s Sake, said young people had helped create a significant shift\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspmomentum grows\u0026nbspfor a Final Say vote.

If they back Brexit, this polls shows that young people may no longer back Labour.”On Sunday bookmaker William Hill said a second referendum is now the most likely Brexit scenario.The company said a new vote before the end of 2020 is a “probability rather a possibility”, becoming the first bookie to give it a greater than 50 per cent chance of happening.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Parliament has taken it. We know the options for Brexit. Parliament will have to decide on one of them. If parliament can’t then it should decide to go back to the people.“Now should be the time of preparation – parliament to make sure it can canvas the options in sensible manner, one by one, to reach agreement on an option or a referendum Europe to ensure that if Britain is ready to think again, Europe is ready also to think again.“All that is necessary is for leadership: in parliament if not in government, and in Europe where despite all the myriad of challenges European leaders have, they should understand that changing Brexit would be the greatest boost to Europe’s economy and politics and that therefore, they need to focus on the part they can play and play it.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.”Her words will likely be seen as an attempt to end growing speculation about the prospect of another referendum.With Labour still mulling whether to table a motion of no confidence in the prime minister this week, she will be desperate to avoid further alienating her\u0026nbspEurosceptic backbenchers.Former Labour foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett, a supporter of the campaign for a People\u0027s Vote, said of Ms May\u0027s remarks:\u0026nbspIt is highly significant that Downing Street felt it had to issue these advance extracts of her statement to the House of Commons on Sunday night, because officials know the prospect of a People\u0027s Vote is being discussed not just in Westminster but in the corridors of Whitehall too.Today\u0026nbspLiam Fox, the international trade secretary, appeared to back calls for MPs to vote on whether to hold a fresh referendum as he suggested parliament could be given a say on a range of Brexit outcomes.The leading Brexiteer\u0026nbspsaid he was not opposed to the idea of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspbeing given a free vote on “what the options were” if, as expected, Ms May’s deal is rejected by MPs.With the proposed withdrawal agreement “unlikely” to be approved by parliament, ministers needed to accept that there are only a\u0026nbsp“limited number of real-world options” available to them, he added.Five Remain-supporting cabinet ministers are reported to be urging Ms May\u0026nbspto hold a series of “indicative votes” in the Commons\u0026nbspon what the government’s next step should be,\u0026nbspbut Mr\u0026nbspFox is the first Leave-backing minister\u0026nbspto endorse the calls.\u0026nbspHis intervention came as Ms May’s deputy and her chief of staff were forced to deny reports that they are secretly preparing for a Final Say referendum.And as\u0026nbsptensions spilled over and No 10 tried to distract attention from deepening Tory isions, Ms May become embroiled in a bitter public spat with Tony Blair on the issue of\u0026nbspanother public vote.The cabinet will meet on Tuesday with ministers expected to clash over how they should respond to widespread Commons opposition to the proposed withdrawal agreement.Mr\u0026nbspFox said he would did not want a second referendum, which he claimed would “perpetuate the isions in the country”.“It wasn’t the government that was given an instruction by the referendum, it was parliament.”“Parliament said in that referendum, ‘We can’t make a decision – in this particular area we are going to subcontract our sovereignty to the people.’\u0026nbspAnd they gave us an instruction.\u0026nbspIt’s time parliament carried it out.”And in a\u0026nbspsign of growing support for\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspbeing given more say over Brexit, he suggested it would be parliament, not ministers, that “will have to decide on the alternatives” if Ms May is unable to secure the changes needed to get her deal through the Commons.Damian\u0026nbspHinds, the education secretary, also said on Sunday that he was open to the idea of flushing out the different options, while Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has for weeks been calling\u0026nbspfor Tory MPs to be given a free vote on the proposed Brexit deal.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It comes amid\u0026nbspreports that David\u0026nbspLidington, Ms May’s deputy,\u0026nbspmet with Labour\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsplast week to discuss a cross-party consensus\u0026nbspfor another referendum, while Gavin\u0026nbspBarwell, her chief of staff, reportedly told ministers that a public vote is “the only way out of this”.The pair took to Twitter to pour cold water on the claims.Mr\u0026nbspBarwell\u0026nbspwrote: “Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a 2nd\u0026nbspreferendum with political opponents (or anyone else to anticipate the next question).”Mr\u0026nbspLidington\u0026nbspposted a link to a statement he made in the Commons last week in which he said another public vote “would certainly be isive but could not guarantee to be decisive in ending this debate” and said its proponents “should not underestimate the damage that would be done to what is already fragile public confidence in our democratic\u0026nbspinstitutions.”He added: “As throughout my time in government I listen to views of\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon all sides of the EU debate.”Dividing lines were drawn\u0026nbspand potential candidates to succeed Ms May jostled for position ahead of Tuesday’s key cabinet meeting. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who admitted he fancied “a crack” at being prime minister, said\u0026nbspthe UK could “flourish and prosper” if it leaves the EU without an agreement, while Ms Mordaunt put forward a plan for using technology to\u0026nbspkeep\u0026nbspthe Northern Ireland border open if there is\u0026nbspa no-deal Brexit,Sajid\u0026nbspJavid, the home secretary, and Andrea\u0026nbspLeadsom, the leader of the Commons, are also likely to push for a managed no-deal exit if Ms May’s deal is rejected.But Remain-supporting ministers\u0026nbspincluding Mr\u0026nbspLidington, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and Amber Rudd, the work and pensions\u0026nbspsecretary, are understood to be pushing Ms May to hold a series of “indicative votes”, including the option of a second referendum. It is\u0026nbspbelieved they are\u0026nbspbacked by David Gauke, the justice secretary, and Greg Clark, the business secretary.On Saturday, Ms Rudd called on Ms May to “try something different” and attempt\u0026nbspto build cross-party support\u0026nbspfor an alternative Brexit plan.As the campaign for a Final Say vote gathered pace, Tony Blair hit back at Ms May after she launched a blistering attack on him.The war of words escalated when\u0026nbspthe former prime minister called Ms May “irresponsible” and claimed she was trying to “steamroller” her deal through parliament.Hours earlier, she had accused the former Labour leader of “undermining” her during negotiations with the EU, and she said his lobbying for another referendum was “an insult to the office he once held and the people he once served”.In response, Mr\u0026nbspBlair said it was clear that “neither the British people nor their parliament will unite behind the prime minister’s deal”.He said: “In these circumstances it is not irresponsible or insulting to put forward an alternative way to achieve resolution. The sensible thing is now to allow parliament to vote on each of the forms of Brexit canvassed including the prime minister’s deal.“If they can’t reach agreement then the logical thing is to go back to the people. To describe such a course as an insult is a strange description of what would be the opportunity for them to instruct parliament as to how to proceed. Far from being anti-democratic it would be the opposite, as indeed many senior figures in her party from past and present have been saying.”Criticising Ms May’s approach, he added: “What is irresponsible however is to try to steamroller MPs into accepting a deal they genuinely think is a bad one with the threat that if they do not fall into line, the government will have the country crash out without a deal.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It was an ‘undercutters’ charter’.“But these reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy.“Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.queuing up for free food because they can’t afford to eatAnd Labour said the reforms would “do nothing” to help people on zero hours contracts.The party’s shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: “This Conservative government has failed to support workers. Instead it has increased tribunal fees, attacked the health and safety of workers, introduced the draconian Trade Union Act and presided over the lowest wage growth in a decade.“These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So while you do see a few more people speaking out, there is a lot of logic in the minds of people who are concerned about speaking out, because they’re concerned about their family members inside China.”She said there was also the issue that it was harder for those who had been detained to leave China, adding: “When you see a government denying people the right to leave, it generally means they’ve got something to hide.”\u0026nbspUighur\u0026nbspminority abroad to spy on compatriotsWhile Chinese officials initially issued blanket denials the country ran mass internment camps, they later defended them by saying they were used for citizens who were guilty of minor offences as vocational centres to provide employment opportunities.Dabancheng in Xinjiang (ReutersThomas Peter)The international reaction has also been somewhat muted, though criticism of Beijing’s treatment of its Muslim minority is\u0026nbspincreasing.“If any other government in the world was locking up a million Muslims I think we can reasonably expect to have seen demands for a debate at the UN Security Council or an international investigation,” Ms Richardson said. “That’s generally unlikely to happen with China.”Last week, the United Nations’ most senior human rights official recently requested direct access to the Xinjiang region to verify the “worrying reports” of re-education camps.“We have been asking for direct access to the region to be able to check and verify the worrying reports we are receiving,” Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights, told a news conference in Geneva.Her request came a day after Germany’s human rights commissioner, Barbel Kofler, said China had blocked her from travelling to the region.“I am shocked by reports of the treatment of the Turkic Uighur minority,” Ms Kofler said in a statement last Tuesday. “I would have liked to have gained a first-hand impression of the situation there and will continue to push for permission to visit Xinjiang soon.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspXinjiang, where up to one million Uighur Muslims are held for ‘re-education’ (Reuters)But Ms Richardson said it was encouraging that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, which states it is\u0026nbsp“the collective voice of the Muslim world”, has issued increasingly strong statements about China and the arbitrary detention of Uighur and Muslim minorities.“One of the threads of those debates all along has been ‘why isn’t the Muslim community of the world speaking up for Muslims in China?’ Well, it looks like they are now,” Ms Richardson said.\u0026nbspUighur man looks on as a truck carrying paramilitary policemen travels along a street during an anti-terrorism oath-taking rally in Urumqi, Xinjiang (Reuters)It comes amid reports more than one million Han Chinese people have moved into the homes of Uighur Muslim families to report on whether they display Islamic or unpatriotic beliefs.American anthropologist Darren Byler said they were tasked with looking for signs their hosts’ attachment to Islam might be “extreme”, such as by looking to see if they had a Quran in the house or fasted at Ramadan.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It has done so without providing any explanation, and left many of those remaining fearing they could be next.Diplomats and charity bosses spoken to by The Independent described the ejection of the 18 international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) not as a knee-jerk decision, but as the culmination of years of hostility from the state towards such bodies.The charities were told at the end of September that they had exhausted all options to appeal their wrapping-up orders, and given 60 days to cease all operations and withdraw from Pakistan.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialAll the INGOs, including the UK charities ActionAid, International Alert and Plan International, have been told they can “re-apply” for registration in Pakistan in six months’ time.But their prospects do not look good, given they have not been told the reasons for their\u0026nbspexpulsion – and therefore what they must rectify. They, like the Western governments that have been lobbying on their behalf for years without success, are left second-guessing the true reason they have been kicked out.Pakistan to expel 18 foreign charities in aid crackdownMany reports have linked Pakistan’s hostility towards foreign charities with the 2011 US military operation that ended in the death of Osama bin Laden. Then, a fake vaccination programme run by the CIA was used to pinpoint the hideout of the 911 mastermind.Few would dispute that this set back genuine vaccination programmes years if not decades – Pakistan remains one of only two countries in the world where polio is endemic – and contributed to a sense of distrust towards INGOs.Few people will actually be leaving Pakistan as a result of the crackdown on international charities. That’s because even before it began the new NGO registration process, the state had been denying visas to foreign workers. Both ActionAid and Plan International confirmed their teams in the\u0026nbspcountry already consisted of Pakistani nationals.Nonetheless, the public image of INGOs as malevolent agents of foreign powers has persisted:\u0026nbspthe media narrative seems to have worked.Created with Sketch.Forgotten Women: The sisters fighting for human rights in Pakistan Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Human rights activist Gulalai Ismail was apprehended by Pakistan officials upon landing in Islamabad after a flight from LondonHuman rights activist Gulalai Ismail was apprehended by Pakistan officials upon landing in Islamabad after a flight from LondonOn the streets of Islamabad, people generally seemed to support a move away from reliance on INGOs. Naeem Awan, a shopkeeper, said foreign charities were “involved in destabilising Pakistan, they are destroying Pakistan’s culture and society”.Raja Moshin, a government employee, said he believed Pakistan “doesn’t need INGOs’ services”.It is\u0026nbspa perception that many believe has been fuelled by Pakistan’s powerful military establishment, which backed the former cricketer Imran Khan in his successful bid to become prime minister and maintains an effective apparatus for quelling dissenting voices in civil society.Independent journalists might criticise a government decision once, but they won’t push it too far, and domestic NGOs are tightly controlled.Foreign charities operating in Pakistan were the last piece in the puzzle – frequently speaking\u0026nbspout about what they were seeing on the ground.Chinese consulate in Pakistan attacked by gunmenClamour grows for Asia Bibi to be granted asylumPakistan’s Imran Khan flies into political storm in Saudi Arabia“The decision by the government of Pakistan to close down these charities is a huge disappointment,” one western diplomat told The Independent. “Sadly it comes as no surprise and is the latest step in several years of disruption of charities, journalists and social activists.“We expect more to come. Each time it is the poor people in Pakistan that suffer the most.”Of around 140 INGOs that applied for registration, 80 were granted permission to continue their operations. The fate of the 40 or so who still haven’t heard is not looking good, with sources close to the process suggesting that another raft of 20 could be told to pack up in the coming weeks.The government of Pakistan has defended its moves to regulate the charity sector – up until 2015, there were no stringent mechanisms to ensure that NGOs, whether foreign or domestic, were well governed.Pakistan would hardly be the first country to seek to move from an aid-based model of crisis intervention to direct action as its economy develops. India has been through a similar process, repeatedly cracking down on foreign funding for NGOs and just this year refusing offers of millions of pounds for victims of flooding in Kerala.Shireen Mazari, Pakistan’s minister for human rights, said the 18 were “denied for non-compliance viz what they had defined as their work”. “They must leave. They need to work within their stated intent, which these 18 didn’t do.”In other words, the charities were not being charged explicitly with spying, or furthering the agenda of a foreign power. None, in fact, was accused of anything specific at all.The Pakistani branch of George Soros’s Open Society Foundations was one of two among the 18 which has fought the decision in court, and is awaiting a decision.Its Pakistan head Dr Saba Khattak told The Independent the charity will argue in court that the government cannot prove any misconduct on their part.“We received notice to stop working, but in that notice we were never told what charge is being brought against us. We are not involved in any illegal work,” she said.Collectively, according to the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum, the 18 charities employed more than 1,100 people in country.“They employed local resources, working with local partners to forge a link with communities which the government cannot,” a spokesperson for the forum told The Independent.“From health to water sanitation to the construction of shelters, they were working on the welfare and development of hard-to-reach communities. Eleven million were benefiting every year from these organisations, and at the moment it seems there’s nothing in place to replace them.”Not everyone The Independent spoke to took a dim view of INGOs. Naseba Bibi, a widow and mother of three, said she had first-hand experience of the work charities do in the country.“My husband passed away seven years ago, and afterwards me and my children were facing serious financial issues. My parents and in-laws were not in a position to support us,” she said.Naseba was introduced through a friend to an NGO offering women training in sewing and embroidery. She said it was something she never would have considered before the death of her husband, a taxi driver and the only bread-winner in the family.Naseba said she did not know what to do now the NGO was winding up. She urged the government to reconsider its decision.Plan International said it alone had supported 26m people during two decades of projects in Pakistan. In a statement, the charity said it was “deeply saddened” to announce it was being forced to close in the country on government orders. “No reason was provided” for the decision, it added.“We are extremely concerned about the impact this will have on communities, particularly hundreds of thousands of children, that Plan International supported through its development work,” the statement read.ActionAid’s general secretary Adriano Campolina said the charity would be “honoured to return” if the government changed its mind. “Our dedicated team of Pakistani nationals supported more than 1.4 million people over the past decade,” he said.“The end of their vital work with marginalised groups is a worrying development for civil society in a country where a fifth of the population is still living in poverty.”International Alert said it had ceased operations after being denied registration and was “waiting to hear from the government on the reapplication process”.“In the meantime, we are trying to minimise negative impact on our partners and beneficiaries in this process,” a spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But there’s still more to do.I welcome The Sun’s campaign for more help for Universal Credit and urge ministers to do more to aid those in society who need it the most.He said the extra money pumped in from the Budget was “helping an enormous amount” but there’s still further to go to ensure the system works for everyone.And he called on ministers to make sure that help for vulnerable Brits when moving over onto Universal Credit is properly funded.Now that stage one of the rollout is complete, ministers must make sure Universal Support programme to help Brits with their applications and debt problems is properly funded so we can identy people who have problems and get them help as soon as possible.And ex-DWP boss Damian Green said that reducing the taper rate further would help Brits.He told The Sun: Universal Credit is a great system which helps people into work, and allows them to increase their hours of work without benefit problems. A few important changes would make it an even better system, and I hope we can make them in the coming years. I was delighted to reduce the taper rate in , and would like this taken further.Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee, also congratulated The Sun on its campaign.He said: My constituents, and hard-up families across the country, need the government to change its position quickly.There is a whole series of problems the government must fix to make Universal Credit work.Closing the yawning gap of five weeks for the first payment, making it pay to get a job and put in more hours, and offering proper support for childcare so parents can get in to work are three important places to start.And Tory rising star Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth Moor View, said the party had to make sure they were there for people in their time of need.He told The Sun: “The British people support and understand the need for welfare reform, of that I have no doubt.Butthere are too many stories, too many people being seriously disadvantaged or not looked after in their hour of need, we will not win this argument, and the country will be the poorer for it.I urge the Treasury and the Prime Minister to reinvest the money originally committed for universal credit and make it the defining policy of a modern compassionate Conservative party it deserves to be.While charities including Child Poverty Action Group, Save the Children, Joseph Rowntree Foundation and TurnUs also backed our calls.Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said: “Three cheers for The Sun’s brilliant campaign to stand up for hard-working families.“The Government must change the system before even more families are pushed into the red as they wait for support.”Universal Credit replaces six benefits with a single monthly payment. One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to % of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister Anneliese Dodds said more changes to Universal Credit were vital.She said: “This Christmas many people are facing insecurity and hardship as a result of the Government’s failed roll out of Universal Credit.“The Sun is absolutely right to campaign for changes to Universal Credit, including cutting the waiting time for payment, but the roll out must be stopped first.“Universal Credit was meant to lt people out of poverty, but all too often it is pushing people into debt, rent arrears and leaving them at risk of destitution.“Labour will stop the roll out of Universal Credit and ensure that we have a social security system that is there for any of us when we need it.”The Liberal Democrats and the SNP also backed our call.Ex Lib Dem boss Tim Farron said: “Instead of fixing the many obvious problems with Universal Credit, the Conservatives have put ideology ahead of evidence and allowed the benefit to become a new poll tax.“The Liberal Democrats strongly support The Sun’s campaign to salvage Universal Credit by cutting its unnecessarily long waiting times and enabling people to keep more of what they earn.”Ruth George MP for High Peak : “None of us want to live in a country where children go hungry, families have to visit food banks, and more people homeless on our streets - just some of the consequences of the disastrous cuts to Universal Credit. Well done The Sun for this campaign. I hope that by all coming together, we can change this cruel policy before another  million households are affected.”Stephen Lloyd MP for Eastbournesaid: I am delighted The Sun are launching this campaign to bring fairness into the governments flagship Universal Credit program. With over ,, people, many of whom in employment, being moved onto Universal Credit over the next couple of years it is vital the government pull out all the stops to ensure it succeeds. Speeding up payments to recipients and making sure those in low-income jobs earn more than they wouldthey were unemployed and on benefit, would make a signicant and positive dference. Common sense from our soaraway Sun. Robert Halfon, Tory MP for Harlowsaid: I am backing the Suns campaign because the Department for Work and Pensions must stand up for making work pay. The defining mission of our Government has to be to help hard working and lower income people who are doing the right thing. They deserve a fair days pay for a fair days work, without needing to worry that the benefits they rely on will be taken away, keeping them in the poverty trap and making it affordable to work. I welcome the extra funding that the Government gave to Universal Credit in the Budget but they need to do more and fast.  Lord John Birdsaid: “By processing Universal Credit payments faster, and by making families childcare payments upfront, the Government has an opportunity to show that its listening to the concerns of struggling people and that it wants to make its flagship welfare programme work.”Ronnie Campbell, MP for Blyth Valley,said: “I support the campaign”.Geraint Davies, MP for Swansea West,said: “In Swansea families wait cold and hungry for their first universal credit payment only to find its been hammered by tax because of a punitive earning threshold. Job Centres are so tied up with claimants needing help with applications that they aren’t able to help people find a job. So more people are using foodbanks and run up debts. That’s why I support the Sun’s campaign to make payments faster and fairer for those most in need.”Liam Byrne, MP for Birmingham, Hodge Hill,said: “Universal credit has turned into a punishment beating for thousands of our neighbours whose only crime is to be low-paid, poor or disabled. We are the fth richest country on earth. It is simply inexcusable for an arm of government to be forcing people to go without and so I fully support The Suns campaign to get these changes made before this careless policy hurts even more families.”Bob Blackman MP for Harrow East,said: “I support the policy that is Universal Credit and its reformist core: replacing six complex benefits with a single unied system.What I am concerned about is ensuring it is properly funded and I have lobbied ministers on this point.Another concern of mine, and one which is covered by this campaign, is ensuring claimants are paid in good time.I am pleased to be supporting this campaign.Nik Dakin, MP for Scunthorpe,said: “I support the campaign to make Universal Credit work for people and families.  That means cutting the time people have to wait to get their money so they don’t have to rely on foodbanks to feed their families.  Parents should get more of their money upfront instead of being paid in arrears.”Rushanara Ali, MP for Bethnal Green and Bow,said: “The Government is in complete denial over the problems with Universal Credit. This programme is pushing millions of families into poverty, causing a rise in homelessness, debt and a % increase in foodbank use.  “This policy disproportionately hurts women, people with disabilities and those from ethnic minorities. It is sickening that the government will limit and delay funds for those who need it most.“A particularly cruel part of the Universal Credit welfare reform is the ‘two-child limit’ policy, which limits the level of financial support to low-income families with more than two children, which, ultimately punishes children.”Yvonne Fogue, MP for Makerfield,said:  A social security system that increases poverty rather than alleviating it isn’t worthy of the name. Which is why I support the need to make vital changes to Universal Credit.  Late payments and underpayments are propelling our most vulnerable citizens into the arms of unscrupulous payday lenders and must end.Steve McCabe, MP for Birmingham Selly Oak,said: “Universal Credit was meant to simply the benefits system, help people find employment and make work pay. Unsurprisingly this government has made a shambles of it and what we are actually seeing is millions of people pushed into debt and into the arms of loan sharks because they are forced to wait over a month to receive their first payment. Government cuts mean that working people are actually worse off under Universal Credit than they were before and families are telling me there are facing late payment fees from their nursery because of problems with the Universal credit childcare payments. How is this fair I am calling on the new Secretary of State to urgently review the system and make the necessary changes so my constituents aren’t faced between the prospect of heating or eating this Christmas.SNP Work and Pensions spokesperson Neil Gray added: “The UK government’s appalling Universal Credit system is pushing households into hardship, debt and a reliance on emergency support including foodbanks as the welfare system is just not there for them when they need it.“The SNP have demanded the UK Government make these changes since the early stages of rollout and any campaign to put these wrongs right deserves support from political parties across the spectrum.The Government must listen to the calls of the public, charities, parliaments, and newspapers - including this campaign by The Sun - to fix Universal Credit once and for all.”And charities helping struggling Brits on Universal Credit also demanded ministers sit up and take notice of The Suns campaign.Chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group Alison Garnham said: “Universal credit isn’t fit for families or ready for further roll-out.“The Sun’s ideas for fixing Universal Credit are spot on - they’re based in the real world where people don’t have money to tide them over for five weeks before their first payment or extra cash for paying childcare fees upfront.“We hope that ministers will act on The Sun’s campaign and take steps to put things right.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she welcomed the input of Sun readers to the debate on Universal Credit.She said: Universal Credit has helped people into work, giving them the confidence of a pay packet and boosting their self-esteem.In my first few weeks at the Department I’ve seen what a force for good Universal Credit can be.However I know that there are problems, and I am committed to tackling those issues.We need to build on what Universal Credit already delivers, ensuring that we do even more to look after families and claimants who need us.And I very much welcome the input of Sun readers as I do this.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation , said: “The government should listen to The Sun’s campaign and make changes to Universal Credit. “Low pay and high costs like rent and childcare are locking families into impossible situations - and the wait to receive support can leave many on the brink.”Alison Taylor, from TurnUs, said: “We fully support the Sun’s campaign to improve Universal Credit.“We have seen people who have been pushed into housing and fuel arrears and struggling to cover everyday essentials by having to wait a minimum of five weeks for their entitlement.“Reducing this to two weeks could drastically improve the financial and emotional wellbeing of iniduals and families.”Brendan Sarsfield, chief executive of housing association Peabody, said: “Universal Credit isn’t working yet. The principle is right, but in practice it’s causing real hardship for people on low incomes. “We know that faster payments, upfront support with childcare costs, and letting people keep more of their wages before losing benefits would transform lives and offer a route out of poverty. “That’s why Peabody is backing the Sun’s campaign to Make Universal Credit Work.”Lucie Russell, Director, Fair By Design, and co-founder of the Big Issue: “The bottom line is that Universal Credit is just not up to scratch. This is causing hardship and distress to millions of people around the country. We support the Sun’s calls for an urgent change in the Universal Credit system, so that being poor stops costing more.” Rosie Fergusson, Chief Executive, Gingerbread: “Universal Credit isn’t working for single parents like Jess, who is on a zero-hours contract and finding it dficult to pay the nursery fees upfront. It doesn’t need to be this way. We will continue to press for change to make Universal Credit work for people like Jess.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000424156981.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu choosing not to give pm what she needs","story":"This is not just The Sun’s view. Former EU leaders are imploring their successors to see sense.Ex-Commission President José Manuel Barroso says: “If there’s political will the excellent lawyers of the EU can find a creative solution for the backstop.“It is crucial to avoid resentment. I hope the EU council understands it. There will be no third country more important than the UK.”His predecessor Romano Prodi has also said the EU could give ground.But it will take more than vague promises. Our power to exit the Irish backstop has to be legally binding — and approved by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.It seems vanishingly unlikely. But it’s the one thing that could yet see Mrs May’s deal rise like Lazarus from the dead.PHILIP Hammond’s “extremists” jibe at Brexit-supporting Tory backbenchers was reckless and stupid.If anything is likely to hasten a catastrophic split in the Tories it’s the Chancellor of a minority Government declaring war on scores of his own MPs. But it also displayed staggering ­contempt for politicians committed to honouring the referendum and the election manesto on which they stood.Politics has been debased by charlatans making promises they dump as soon as it’s convenient. It is in a critical stateNOT doing so is “extreme”.If there are extremists in Parliament besides the obvious, Corbyn and McDonnell, it is those playing roulette with national stability by attempting to stage a second referendum before the verdict of the first is carried out.It is incredible that it is considered mainstream, noble even, of these MPs to renege on promises they made and votes they cast — and to refuse to honour the majority’s will because the losing minority must have their “final say”.All while performing intellectual ­contortions to justy what, deep down, they know is unjustiable: imposing their will over the public’s. That is a far more extreme position than anything on the Tory backbenches.“Everyone knows who won,” says ­Benedict Cumberbatch in the trailer for Channel ’s upcoming Brexit movie.We do. Some MPs have forgotten.FOR  years The Sun has cheered on Britain’s forces at our Millies spectacular.We hope we did them proud again last night.

They need to do far more when it comes to outreach, actually visiting isolated and deprived areas and talking to children years before they start thinking about university.Otherwise, a child growing up in a community where very few people have a degree will believe university just isn’t for them.The top universities all have their own outreach policies, and don’t work together to reach particularly under-represented parts of the country, which means entire towns can often end up being ignored.The political world doesn’t help, either. A young, white, working-class boy might not think he fits into the current Parliament, and so a vicious cycle of the same sort of people from the same sort of backgrounds going into politics continues. We know all the figures about the percentage of MPs who went to private schools , or that  prime ministers were schooled at Eton.But what we are less likely to realise is that there are entire towns in this country that have never, ever had an MP who was born and schooled locally.Or that the cost of getting into politics means thatyou are from a working-class background, your only hope of becoming an MP is landing a well-paid job first. And that tends to be easieryou’ve been to university.MPs tend to recruit their researchers straight from university. Researchers go on to become special advisers or take other political jobs before becoming MPs, so the political gene pool is articially shallow from the beginning.It’s handy to have MPs who hail from all kinds of backgrounds, but especially useful to have people who grew up in tough circumstances.When governments make mistakes, it is usually the most vulnerable people who suffer first. A Parliament of old Etonians can’t always instinctively realise when a policy is going to cause trouble.I don’t need to tell you that the current Parliament isn’t working very well.From those at the top of government who have failed to take big decisions on Brexit, to the backbenchers who have been busy plotting away, a lot of people in Westminster seem to be lacking a sense of perspective.This week the drama has all been about Brexit, but the infighting means that serious policy problems on social care, domestic abuse and, yes, education are largely ignored.If we made it easier for any bright kid from any background to get to university, perhaps we would have more competition for Parliamentary seats — and end up with better politicians.SoDamian Hinds got his way with universities, he’d be putting the future mediocre politicians out of a job.There might even be entire weeks in politics when you’d have a chance of noticing comments made by the Education Secretary, rather than being distracted by the self-indulgent way in which politicians of all persuasions have ended up conducting themselves.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As other leaders said, she was very ­specic about the legally binding text she needed to convince the DUP and her backbenchers to approve the deal.The two-day meeting was actually scuppered by an agreement suddenly being trashed by Ireland and France.Do they have any inkling how much goodwill between our nations they have destroyed with their parlour games over the past ½ years  How many once pro-EU Brits they convert into Leavers with every new salvo Do they not grasp how mistrustful, obstructive and even hostile we would become as an EU member , God forbid, Remain won a second referendum Senior Cabinet ministers including Sajid Javid and Jeremy Hunt are rightly imploring Mrs May to focus every effort on No Deal preparations. A “managed No Deal” to soften the impact after March  looks a decent idea to us.The Sun always wanted a deal. It’s not going to happen. The EU has other ideas.And a second referendum, or “Norway Plus”, both amount to craven surrenders to this bloated organisation which ­apparently ­relishes belittling Britain. We must get out.TONY Blair is a delusional egomaniac who has damaged Britain more than any politician we can recall.It was his negligence and naivety over dodgy intelligence that condemned  of our troops and countless Iraqis to their deaths during the  invasion.It was his decision to unleash a vast, uncontrolled influx of migrants on a country ill-equipped for it . . . all, as his adviser later admitted, to “rub the Right’s nose in ersity”.It was his lust for wealth after leaving office that saw him torch what was left of his reputation and line his pockets with dictators’ millions.Now Blair is hell-bent on setting a match to our democracy itself as he heads the campaign to reverse the biggest mandate in its history, sabotaging our Brexit negotiating position in the process.And so the trail of destruction he has left for  years goes on. The common thread being his unassailable conviction, despite every single catastrophic mistake, that Tony always knows best.Many of us stopped listening long ago.

Thousands of parts go into every car – some cross the channel several times before the car is complete.They all have to arrive at plants in the Midlands or on Merseyside at exactly the right moment and in the right order. Half the parts for cars made in Britain typically come from Europe.It would be greatthey were made here, but that can’t happen quickly. Worse, the supply chain that has grown up here in the last decade could decide to leavewe get the wrong deal.Leaving on WTO terms would also put people out of work too because tarfs would increase the price of cars built in Britain and sold in Europe by ten per cent.Theresa May’s deal isn’t perfect but is still our best option in front of us to protect jobs, keep employment and environmental standards, deliver a fair immigration system and safeguard border arrangements in Ireland.For all its flaws, the Brexit deal meets these priorities.It commits to maintain ‘high standards of free and fair trade and workers’ rights, consumer and environmental protection’, and a level playing-field on regulations.And it ensures that there is no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.There will never be a perfect deal. Butwe want to avoid trust in politics being damaged even more, andwe want to protect jobs and standards, we must think long and hard before rejecting the only deal on offer.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The overwhelming majority earned total remuneration – including base pay, overtime, employer pension contributions and certain allowances - of £, or considerably less.Just over three per cent of drivers earned total remuneration over this, largely because they are highly skilled test drivers and instructors who have additional responsibilities to train drivers in the safe operation of trains using new, advanced signalling systems.“These terms and conditions were agreed with trade unions in . As with all other agreements made between London Underground and our unions, we have adhered to these terms and conditions since.

We’ve faced much bigger challenges in our history.”It was a shrewd move by the ambitious Foreign Secretary.  Leaving the EU without a deal has suddenly become a hot favourite with Brexit leadership rivals. It is also the outcome feared most in the capitals of Europe.The German official’s response is shocking proof that Theresa May’s mantra: “No Deal is better than a Bad Deal” was always seen as an empty bluff.It also refutes the claim that her widely-loathed withdrawal plan is the only option available from Brussels. Mr Hunt brushed aside Project Fear’s portrayal of a “Car Crash” Brexit and insisted Britain can cope with all challenges.“We shouldn’t pretend there won’t be disruption,” he admitted. “That’s why as a responsible government we have to make all the preparations necessary.”Far from the clf-edge, car-crash nightmare painted by the Treasury, BBC and CBI, a clean Brexit is entirely manageable. It would set us free to trade on terms set by the Government in the interests of the British people.We would save the £billion ransom to Brussels — and use some of the cash to buy time from the EU for more detailed planning. And it would see off slippery Tony Blair’s treacherous call for a second referendum.Yes, there would be turbulence as the UK adjusted to ending  years of EU membership.  But experts such as ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King predict we will look back on this moment and barely see a blip on our economic growth chart.Indeed, economists believe Britain will thrive and prosper once free from EU shackles. So why are Remainer MPs so implacably determined to stop it  Why are they reneging on their own manesto pledges and threatening to overturn the legislation which set the March deadline Simple. Once we are out, we are out for ever. We can prove we are a great world economy, trading to every corner of the globe — Europe included. We would never rejoin the cosy exclusive club beloved of the political elite, unelected bigwigs and business fat cats who ride the Brussels gravy train.Only  per cent of UK goods — one eighth — goes to Europe, with the rest heading for the wider world or home markets.The EU share of world trade is on the slide. Game-changing technology is alien to its socialist outlook. Where, for instance, is the EU equivalent of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon or Google Brussels turns its face against progress — allegedly because it threatens jobs. Yet Eurozone unemployment is double Britain’s and criminally high among young people.Remainers claim under-s are fans of the EU and would vote Remain in a second referendum. Labour is trying to cash in by cutting the voting age from  to . Yet a revealing new poll suggests the youth of Britain and Europe sees right through the EU drive for a political and economic superstate.Given the choice, they pick free markets, low tax and low regulation over the suffocatingly interventionist Grand Project. These tech-savvy youngsters can see Europe is trailing behind while unimaginable opportunities from robot technology and Articial Intelligence unfold.Britain would miss out too, barred by EU regulation,we tied ourselves indefinitely to this inward-looking protectionist bloc. A Full Brexit might cause a few short- term hiccups for just-in-time deliveries, but they will be quickly forgotten as decades of opportunity are opened up by Brexit.UKplc has nothing to fear but Project Fear itself. Warnings of economic chaos, mass unemployment and house price crashes have repeatedly proved to be .The same scare stories were peddled by the same people who  years ago predicted Britain would sink unless we joined the European single currency. We never looked back. It is the Eurozone that is now sinking, with Greece already under water. Britain’s jobs miracle is the envy of EuropeThe Eurozone is mired in a crisis inflicted by uncontrolled mass immigration and youth alienation.  The most patriotic Frenchman couldn’t claim Paris is nice at this time of the year. By contrast Britain is a hive of activity, with steady growth, booming exports and a jobs miracle which is the envy of Europe.The UK is a magnet to the EU’s unemployed and to foreign investment worth billions from tech giants such as Apple, Amazon and Google — despite Brexit.Leaving without a deal on March  is our best chance of implementing the  referendum and escaping from a teetering, corrupt and arrogant political fantasy before it implodes.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In plain English we’ve hit a dead end.Theresa May’s attempt to move things again following this week’s Westminster turmoil has failed. The EU has knocked her back once again.Parliament had already firmly indicated the Government’s proposed deal will never be passed.So what now  This is not the time to roll over. It is time to stand up to the Europeans, be confident and start again. There is still time and there is anLast week we launched the first chapter of an alternative EU deal, written by renowned trade experts Shanker Singham, Robert MacLean and Hans Maessen.It plots a way forward which would deliver the real prizes of Brexit such as global free trade deals and regaining control for the British people.It solves the problem of the Irish backstop which has so plagued negotiations. It preserves a transition period and prepares the way for a Canada style free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. It solves the backstop problem by making use of existing streamlined customs procedures already in use across the world.These are the same arrangement which Michel Barnier would have been happy to impose when he suggested a customs border in the Irish Sea.It avoids a hard border, respects the Good Friday Agreement and removes the challenge to the territorial integrity of the UK. It enables a smooth UK withdrawal and avoids an attempt to exercise jurisdiction in the territory of a non-Member State by the EU.This means the UK takes back control of borders, laws and money as the British people were promised.It proposes a better deal for the UK and a better deal for the EU. Any failure by the EU to reach a deal acceptable to its nearest neighbour, closest ally and largest third-country market will have signicant adverse political and economic consequences, within the EU and around the world.Believe me as somebody who stared into the eyes of EU negotiators, they do not want the UK to leave without a deal, any more than we do.So, we have an alternative Withdrawal Agreement ready and waiting on the shelf. I strongly advise the Government to present this to the EU immediately, along with a clear framework of a Trade Agreement.Since this proposal builds on what has already been offered, there is very little reason for the EU to reject it. We need to show people across the EU that we have momentum and are moving towards a satisfactory solution.This proposal is anything but nebulous! Frankly, future generations will not forgive uswe fail them.Other solutions just will not wash. Some talk of a Norway deal asit’s an easy middle way and a fashionable alternative. It’s not!A Norway Deal could mean the EU controls  per cent of our laws.At present Norway pays a financial contribution to the EU which is only slightly lower per capita than the UK’s EU membership contribution and they have largely given up control over immigration.Even the Prime Minister of Norway Erna Solberg says, “the EEA is probably not a good solution for Britain.” A Norway style path with continued free movement would not respect the result of the referendum and would be bad for Britain.A second Referendum too is a non-starter. What message would it send to ignore the decisive verdict of the British people in the  Referendum.There is already huge suspicion of EU institutions and scheming politicians.Making people vote again until they reach the verdict a self-appointed establishment desire is a sickening prospect and wrong.The irony is that every last person pushing the so-called “People’s Vote” are doing so because thy hate the result of the first People’s Vote.The British people delivered their view in the  Referendum and that should now be honoured. Whatever happens we will depart the EU on March  because that is written in primary legislation.So we have to make it work and we owe the British people our utmost efforts to do the best we can.That’s why I want to step up No deal preparations in case such an exit is necessary. Plans for such an exit are already more advanced than someA great deal of work has been done in Whitehall to prepare for all contingencies, but progress was delayed in March when the Treasury and Number  blocked the public phase of preparation.This has put the programme behind by some months, but it can be recovered.We should seek to secure bilateral arrangements with the EU on a ‘bare bones’ basis for aviation, data management, and the like as a matter of urgency.In addition the Government can look at measures on VAT, hospitals, financial services, and farming to ensure we are ready.We also need to guarantee funding for science and innovation to keep the UK’s competitive advantage and to complement the work done on programmes such as Horizon .Europe is itself making some changes spontaneously: only this week it approved its banks to use British Clearing Houses, because that was the only way to protect the European financial networks.Such an approach actually makes obtaining a deal more likely as the EU realise more and more that we are serious. They know that a World Trade Organisation deal will enable the UK to strike Free Trade Agreements around the world.Freed from alignment with the EU, the UK will be able to pursue trade deals with countries like Australia, New Zealand, India, China, the United States, Singapore and Japan who have a combined GDP of . trillion dollars.All of these countries say they want trade deals with the UK. On Friday, Switzerland committed to a free trade deal in all circumstances.There is a credible alternative to the present shambles. Quite literally,the UK has the will there is a way.

The Prime Minister will use an address to the Commons on Monday to say a new national poll would do irreparable damage to the integrity of British politics. The move comes after close allies of Mrs May distanced themselves from reports that they were manoeuvring to bring about a fresh referendum. And Solicitor General Robert Buckland became the latest senior Tory to float the idea of a free vote in the Commons on Brexit. Mrs May will use a statement to Parliament following last weeks bruising EU summit to claim another referendum would further ide the UK. The PM will say: Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum.  Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it. The appearance follows Mrs Mays de facto deputy, Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington, and the PMs chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, both dismissing reports they are planning for a new referendum. And Mrs May faces a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday following a frantic few days when key ministers have jockeyed for attention and staked out strong Brexit positions. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Britain would prosper evenit quit the EU with no deal, while Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd argued firmly against leaving the bloc without an agreement. And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox indicated he could support MPs being given a free vote on Brexit options.  Prominent Brexiteers like International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt also look set to make their views known. Asked about the prospect of a free vote in the Commons on Brexit where MPs would not be whipped, the Solicitor General told BBC Radio s Westminster Hour: I think thats certainly something that we need to look at very carefully. If we are going to do it, I think everybody needs to do it - cross-party. I thinkall the parties agreed to it then it is something that might well work. But, I think it would be imbalancedone party did it and the other one did not. Prominent Brexiteer and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson railed against the idea of a second referendum. Writing in the Daily , he said: A second referendum would provoke instant, deep and ineradicable feelings of betrayal. Mr Johnson said the idea that the Government would hold a fresh Brexit poll was sickening. Labour is insisting that Mrs May puts her Brexit deal to a vote in the Commons before Parliament rises for Christmas on Thursday. However, the party has made it clear it will not table a motion of no confidence in the Government until such a vote has been held.

The international development secretary has been holding secret talks with key members of the hardline European Research Group in a bid to win their support for a rumoured leadership bid. She is expected to unveil detailed plans for a managed no deal to cut the UKs Brexit bill tomorrow nightin a move which will fuel speculation she wants the top job. The Mirror understands that she worked on the proposals with ERG members including Michael Tomlinson, a former deputy chair of the group who has been tipped as a future campaign manager. Ms Mordaunt, who is the only cabinet minister to fail to publicly back the PMs Brexit deal, is expected to set out more detail of her own plan to pursue a free trade agreement. Theresa May’s authority, already weakened by her ing virtually empty-handed from Brussels last week, was in shreds tonight as ministers lined up to set out their own Brexit stalls.  Remainer Amber Rudd said she should “forge a consensus” across party lines, reaching a soft Brexit consensus, while foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed the UK would “flourish and prosper” after a no deal Brexit. However, Mordaunt’s engagement with leading members of the ERG will raise eyebrows as the Brexiteer group was the force behind last week’s attempts to oust Mrs May as Tory leader. One senior Tory source said: Obviously people talk to one another but theres a pretty big leap between having a chat with Jacob [Rees-Mogg] or Steve [Baker] and working with key figures in the ERG to pull together a plan that is ultimately your plan for government. These are the people who are literally trying to get rid of her boss. An ERG insider added: “Penny is the most ERG person left in the Cabinet so it’s hardly surprising that she’s fishing in the pool. Mrs May has come under growing pressure from her ministers to give MPs a free “indicative” vote on all the Brexit options this side of Christmas. They will attempt to persuade her at Cabinet tomorrow [Tuesday] that the votes would show that none of the alternatives, including a Norway-style deal or a Canada-style free trade agreement, would get majority support in parliament. The ministers have been buoyed by their success in getting the PM to cancel last week’s meaningful vote.  Education secretary Damian Hinds said it was the only way to flush out levels of parliamentary support for the dferent plans, while Trade secretary Liam Fox suggested it could break the political deadlock. Other ministers thought to back the plan include Ms Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Business Secretary Greg Clark. Downing Street has rejected the proposal. One No  insider said: “The idea that this solves anything or is a path to anywhere is wishful thinking.” Mrs May will tomorrow hit out at calls for a new Brexit referendum after her chief of staff Gavin Barwell and de facto deputy PM David Lidington were accused of preparing for one behind her back. But the chances of a second referendum appeared to have increased in the wake of the PM’s decision to pull the vote on her deal and herfrom the EU summit without any legally binding assurances on the unpopular Irish border backstop. But she will tell MPs: “Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum. Another vote which would do irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics, because it would say to millions who trusted in democracy, that our democracy does not deliver. Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further ide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it.  The PM’s closest aides denied they were either planning for, or wanted, a second referendum. But both men are understood to believe that is where the country will end up. Mr Barwell tweeted: Happy to confirm I am *not* planning a nd referendum with political opponents .” Sources close to Mr Lidington also strongly denied that he had suggested to Labour MPs at a meeting last week that he was interested in pursuing the option. A wave of no deal planning is expected to be unleashed by Whitehall departments this week with preparations for a range of doomsday scenarios set into motion. Downing Street today dismissed reports that people will be advised not to book holidays after March next year according to no deal contingency plans. Home secretary Sajid Javid is also finally expected to publish the Governments immigration plans on Wednesday, with a row brewing over low-skilled workers. Meanwhile, Labour’s top team was split over the timing of holding a no confidence vote in the government. The party’s elections guru Andrew Gwynne MP said it would try to force a Brexit vote before Christmas but said Labour would not try to oust the PM until this had had taken place. But Labour’s chief whip, Nick Brown, told the BBC it was “certainly a possibility” that the party could table a no confidence vote in the Government as early as Monday. He said the fact that  of her own MPs had voted against her had given “pause for thought” on the timing of the vote. “Clearly we would have itwe had a prospect of winning,” he added. Deputy leader Tom Watson and shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer are among those backing swt action, while those backing Jeremy Corbyns more cautious approach include shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow education secretary Angela Rayner.

Sending cards to people we live with  There are some very good reasons for sending Christmas cards to people you are not going to see at Christmas. For instance, whatyour Auntie Flo thinks that, unaccountably, you dont want her to have a Merry Christmas and or Happy New Year  You can put her mind at rest with regard to whether you wish her Seasons Greetings with a simple trip to the post box. But do we really need to give Christmas cards to people who use the same bar of soap as you  Do we really need to risk a paper cut on the tongue to wish close family members a cool Yule, when you could just shout it into their faces  Yes, apparently we do.  Putting foliage in your living room  - “What are you doing, Brian ” - “Ive just been out to cut down a tree.” - “What, for firewood ” - “No, I am going to bring it indoors.” - “What, an entire living tree ” - “Of course not!” - “Good!” - “Its dead now. Anyway, Im going to stand it up in a bucket and then cover its slowly drying and decaying branches with glittering scarves, shiny balls, and colourful lights.” - “But thats insane.” - “Yes, but its December.” - “Fair enough, carry on.”  Going to the work do  Ah, the office Christmas party! What are we thinking  Whose idea was it to say, “I know, lets gather together people we have to pay to spend time together normally, with all their resentments about the tea round, and put them in a big room with loud music and freely flowing alcohol. What could possibly go wrong ” Indeed, what could possibly go wrong with getting roaring drunk on a night out with your boss   Blackmailing children into behaving  We spend most of the year telling children to beware of strangers. And then, from the middle of November, we tell them that,they be good, a man with a big beard and a sack will break into their home in the dead of night and leave some presents behind. And all the children hear is “be good” and “presents”. And now we have introduced the element of a -hour snitch, the elf on a shelf, to keep our kids honest, in case they were a bit suspicious of Father Christmass ability to find out whos been naughty or nice. Of course, the clever kids keep it to themselves that theyve realised that they get Christmas presents from everybody they know except their parents. Hmm...  Getting an early start Alcohol plays a prominent part in the typical family Christmas. Indeed, it might even be essential, depending on which relatives are visiting. But the important thing is to pace yourself. Dont peak too soon. It would be mad, say, to start at breakfast time. Unless youre putting champagne in your orange juice. Straight off the bat, thats one of your five-a-day. Orange juice and grape juice  That might actually be two of your five-a-day. Its practically a health drink… right   Pretending that satsumas are a treat  Its , for heavens sake. Stop treating easily obtainable citrus fruit as an exotic jewel from the mystic east. Its a Christmas stocking, not your childrens lunch box.  Doing Christmas dinner “with a twist”  OK, OK. Christmas dinner is predictable. But guess what  Its supposed to be. You dont complain there isnt a surprising “-past Belgium” between five-past two and ten-past two on the clock, so dont grumble about the fact its turkey again. You remember what happened when you had goose that year  Exactly. Anyway,youre making Christmas dinner, you are allowed to have only one item “with a twist” or theres going to be mutiny. And, realistically, that means you get to do something fiddly with sprouts. In fact, its chestnuts. Its always chestnuts.  Pretending that sausages wrapped in bacon are a vegetable  Christmas is no time for a vegetarian. The centrepiece of the festive dinner is some meat stuffed with more meat. And then, to garnish this, we add some cylinders of meat wrapped in more meat. And somehow we can eat as many of these cylinders as we like, because its basically just like eating extra carrots or sprouts. Christmas dinner is the the only dinner where you can feel relatively virtuous by eating a roast potato.  Sabotaging pudding  Imagine youre eating a nice dessert, in a restaurant, say. Perhaps a lovely sticky toffee pudding. And youre tucking in happily. And then you bite down on a hard piece of metal. Would you call over the waiter and ask him to pass on your compliments to the chef  Or would you leave a very tart review on TripAdvisor  But at Christmas finding an actual coin in your pudding is considered lucky, rather than actionable. It isnt even an accident. Somebody, in fact, a supposed loved one, has intentionally put shrapnel in your dessert. All you can hope is that one of the crackers has instructions on the Heimlich manoeuvre inside.  Playing board games  It always seems like a good idea at the time. What could be nicer than getting the family around the table to play a game after the Christmas dinner has been cleared away  The family, they say, that plays together stays together. The problem is that the family that plays together, cant decide which game theyre going to play. Nor can they agree on the rules, even though theyre very clearly printed on the box. But there is only one game to which everybody knows the rules, and that is snakes and ladders, and it is impossible to cheat in snakes and ladders on behalf of your six-year-old child. Andyour overtired six-year-old child, who has been up since ., cant win, nobody wins.

Jason Dunn, who is also an expert player, started amassing the sets after he was crowned Monopoly world champion during the s. His collection ranges from the classic London edition to modern versions with themes including Elvis Presley, Game of Thrones, Walking Dead and even a Monopoly fruit machine. On Saturday Jason celebrated the delivery of yet another addition, a recently-released Huddersfield board, West Yorks - where he was born. Jason, , said he was pleased with the release and was looking forward to adding it to his extravagant collection. He said: I love Monopoly and Ive played for as long as I can remember, you cant really collect games like Ludo or drafts because Monopoly has its own identity.  You can collect dferent cities like Leeds, Bristol or foreign countries from Iceland or France when you travel abroad. Its just like collecting Star Wars things. Jason has a database which counts how many souvenirs of the family favourite he has after every purchase. The married grandfather of one, was crowned its world champion during the s and he hopes to play and collect for as long as he can. He said: One of the things I most enjoy is playing a board with familiar places, I like to look at the board and think oh i know where that is. I dont think I will stop collecting anything monopoly related, I have souvenirs ranging from aprons, socks, pencil cases, any memorabilia with Monopoly on Ill get. My daughter helps me to keep track of how many pieces I have she fills in a database every time I get something new, its just a bit of fun really.  The collector is looking forward to using his new set and has planned a family game of monopoly on Christmas day. Jason hopes to get his three and a half year old granddaughter into the game once she grows up. Right now she doesnt understand the game but once she gets older Ill be looking to get her to play. Monopoly promoter Graham Barnes said: Jason is to Monopoly what David Beckham is to football and fashion - an icon who gets mobbed at many Monopoly launches for his signature on a new game. He is without doubt one of the worlds best ever players and has a vast collection to boot. We are very proud to have him as an ambassador.  Monopoly was for many years produced and distributed in the UK by Leeds, West Yorks. The company became involved with the game soon after it was invented by unemployed equipment salesman Charles B Darrow in the US in the s. Early in , the firm making it in the States, Parker Brothers, sent a set to Victor Watson, who was running Waddingtons at the time. He famously gave it to his son, Norman, and said: Look this over and tell me what you think of it. Norman took the set home and started playing a game against himself on a Friday night - and was still going on Sunday evening. The next morning he persuaded his father to make the companys first transatlantic phone call and secure Monopolys UK rights.

Tributes have been pouring in for the huge rugby fan, Wales Online reported. Callum, from Brynmawr, south Wales, was diagnosed with Ohtahara syndrome as a baby after he began having up to  seizures a day. Those with the condition are particularly susceptible to repeated chest infections. His family have described how he defied the odds, and was supported by his sisters Katelyn and Kelcea. Callums mum Aime said: Callum was so cheeky, he had me wrapped around his little fingerhe wanted something, He was just so charming - theres so much to say about him. He loved rugby and he loved Jurassic World, his favourite was the raptor Blue. Throughout this year, friends and family had been raising money for Callum to have the perfect Christmas after he had spent December  in hospital for the last three years. In November, family friend Sasha Wilks also organised for the Pen-Y-Cwm pupil to meet the Wales rugby squad during their autumn campaign. Since Callums death, fundraising has now begun to support his family with the cost of his funeral.  Amie, , said: For the last five and a half weeks, Callum didnt have one fit. He went to Ty Hafan last Thursday evening and he was fine. On the night he was on oxygen and we couldnt get him off it. On the Sunday he slept all the day through and didnt wake up at all. We wanted to make him comfortable. He was in a place that was calm and they really respected our wishes. I told all the staff they could come and say their goodbyes and they did.  Since Callums death on Tuesday, his family have been overwhelmed by messages of love and support from across the UK - including from Diversity star Ashley Banjo. Aime said: We got hold of Diversity, as we had met them before, to tell them and Ashley Banjo said we were a lovely family and that he was glad he had met Callum. I cant say enough to thank people for what they have done for me and my daughters and Paul. The support has been immense. The girls are holding it together but deep down I know its bothering them really badly. They were always by his side and loved him so much.  In a video thanking friends for their support, Amie added: Our boy is really going to be missed. Callum touched everyones heart. We will never ever forget him, we will talk of him every day and we love him to bits. We are having to deal with this just before Christmas but he is safe, he is not in pain anymore, he is not suffering any more.  Its so hard to know that hes gone and he will never be there with us but he is with us - hes in our hearts. I cant thank everyone enough for what you are doing right now. Its helping us so much.

Employees encouraged them to safety by calling them and using the strong bonds they had developed with the apes. Once all of the orangutans had been accounted for, staff ensured the door back inside was closed.The animals then wrapped themselves in blankets as a comfort mechanism. Today, devastated staff confirmed all animals who survived are fine and attempts are being made to give them one-to-one health checks.Zoo bosses have also hailed the heroic staff after the fire broke out just before Saturday lunchtime in the Monsoon Forest complex. It quickly engulfed the building, with the whole park evacuated shortly afterwards, reports North Wales Live.   The dome-roofed centre is home to thousands of animals, including primates, crocodiles, snakes and fish. As the inferno raged, zoo staff went into the burning rainforest and brought the creatures - some of which are critically endangered - out to safety. At a press conference, the zoos animal and plant director Mike Jordan said while the larger animals had been rescued, some of the other species - including birds and fish - had died. He said: We know some animals have died. The house contained everything from spiders to stick insects, fish, frogs - it was an incredibly complex forest environment. “Where the fire broke out, we know it was in the vicinity of some fish and insects, and that area has been completely destroyed by fire.   We cannot confirm the exact numbers [of animals that have died] and in some cases it will be uncertain numbers of very small animals. “A very small number of bird carcasses have been recovered but most of the others recovered are alive and healthy. “We lost none of the mammals, none of the primates. We lost none of the gibbons, none of the macaques, none of the orangutans. All of these as of today are safe and being looked after. We were able with our keepers and the relationships they have with the animals, the strong bond between them, to call the animals out. “It allowed us to lead the animals out into their outdoor area and with the help of the fire brigade we were able to get into the enclosure and close the hatches to lock them outside. So eventhey were a little bit chilly at least they were safe.   “Lots of the orangutans have sacking or blankets they like to cuddle and carry around with them. Any that did that during the evacuation, it was self controlled. We didn’t wrap them up in blankets, they did it themselves. I think it was a comfort issue.” At the height of the blaze there were  fire engines tackling it, and high winds from Storm Deirdre sent into the air a large plume of smoke that could be seen for miles around.Eyewitnesses described seeing animals that had been in the building when it went up attempting to make their escape. Antony Johnstone, who was visiting the zoo with his we, daughter and two friends, described seeing orangutans and gibbons leaving the building.   He said: “We were about to literally step foot into the building when another visiting family, who were stood in the entrance, said there was a fire starting and it was closed. “As we walked around the side of the building on the footpath, we could see all the animals were released outside the fire had spread and lots of black smoke came out of the building. “We walked to another area of the zoo and then were told the zoo was closing. “The staff reacted very well and moved the public away, the zoo also issued refunds to our friends with no problems. “We are members of the zoo and it was such a shame to see this happening.” Antony said he saw staff letting the animals into the outside part of their enclosure. He added: “We saw the orangutans coming out and the gibbons swinging around the netting on the enclosure.” By mid-afternoon, the Monsoon Forest had lost its entire polymer roof. Photographs released by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service revealed the dense, lush rainforest enclosure was now a bare, charred, ash-filled shell.   The Islands complex only opened in , and cost around poundm. By late afternoon on Sunday a fundraising campaign had seen more than pound, donated towards rebuilding the habitat. The zoo was open as normal on Sunday and its popular Christmas lantern parade was set to go ahead as normal. But zoo bosses said it had one of the toughest days in our long history. Chief operating officer Jamie Christon added: The remarkable efforts from the zoo team and the emergency services meant the fire was extinguished as quickly as possible. Visitors were evacuated immediately and we would like to thank them for their understanding and cooperation. Thankfully, no staff or public were harmed in the incident. Keepers were able to encourage all mammal species away from the fire and to safety - including the zoo’s group of critically endangered Sumatran orangutans, Sulawesi macaques, endangered silvery gibbons and birds such as rhinoceros hornbills.   We are though, devastated to say that we were unable to save some of our insects, frogs, fish and small birds who were located near to the outbreak of the fire.It’s absolutely heartbreaking to lose any animal, especially when conservationists have worked so hard to breed these wonderful species. New homes have been found within the zoo for all of the animals that were led to safety and our teams are working around the clock to relocate them as soon as possible. The strength and support from the public has been incredibly overwhelming and the messages of goodwill have been of great comfort to our teams. We will support each other in rebuilding this part of the zoo and continue our mission of preventing extinction. The cause of the fire is currently unknown, but we will be helping the relevant authorities with the investigation that will take place over the coming days and weeks. We would again, like to thank the emergency services for their swt response. One person was treated for smoke inhalation at the scene, but there were no reports of any other injuries. An investigation into how the fire started is ongoing, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service said.

They include the Campaign for Female Education, which supports marginalised girls in Africa, and the Association of Commonwealth Universities. The Queen is patron of more than  organisations and charities. Two years ago, she handed  patronages to younger members of the royal family. She gave the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club — host of the Wimbledon tournament - to the Duchess of Cambridge while Prince Harry received the Rugby Football Union. Meanwhile, as we reported yesterday Meghan has asked Harry to skip one royal Christmas tradition.  Prince Harry will reportedly miss the royals’ Boxing Day pheasant shoot out of respect for we Meghan’s principles. The animal-lover refuses to wear fur and is against bloodsports but the Sandringham snub could widen a rt between Harry and brother William. A source said: “He hardly ever misses the shoot but he loves her so much.” The brothers have been a part of the Boxing Day pheasant hunt for more than  years and Harry, , has a reputation as a fine marksman.  Their father Prince Charles will be there and William’s son George, five, may go to watch. But it emerged Harry will instead spend time with pregnant we Meghan. A royal insider told the Sunday Mirror: “In his mind, William sees this as another concerning example of his younger brother being pulled away from his family by his new we. “Harry’s always loved hunting and it has provided them with a great chance to bond as brothers. “But now it looks like Harry’s shooting days are over. It’s the latest point of contention between the Princes after a testing time in their relationship.” "},{"url":null,"title":"moment giant 120 ton raf","story":"NewsMoment giant -ton RAF military Airbus sweeps in to land on Welsh beachThe A Atlas transport aircraft performed the eye-catching maneuvers at Pembury beach in South WalesShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video moment-giant--ton-raf-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJaw-dropping footage shows how a massive RAF carrier performed a series of test landings at a beach in Wales.

Tolls will no longer be charged from first thing on December , resulting in the potential loss of  jobs - but motorists will save pound. on a car crossing.Regular commuters are expected to save more than pound, per year, report Wales Online .The abolition comes as thousands of people are expected to make their journeys home for the festive period.   Charges on the original Severn Crossing have been in place since , when the fee stood at two shillings and sixpence - the equivalent of .p in todays decimal currency. They were then introduced on the second crossing - renamed the Prince of Wales Bridge in April this year - when it opened  years later in .   The Government said scrapping of the tolls would provide an immediate benefit of over pound million per year for Wales, and over a billion pounds of economic benefit over the next decade. The final driver to pay to cross over from England to Wales on Sunday was Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns.   He said: The end of the tolls is a major milestone for the economies of south Wales and south west of England, and will remove historic barriers between communities. Scrapping the tolls means an end to generations of people paying to simply cross the border and delivering this has been one of my key aims as Welsh Secretary.   A week before Christmas drivers will no longer have to pay every time they cross the border, meaning more money in their pockets, helping them with the cost of living and leaving them with and more cash to spend in their local areas. Chris Graying, Secretary of State for Transport, added: We made a commitment in the manesto to deliver free crossings over the Severn and thats exactly what were delivering.   This move will put pound, a year in the pockets of thousands of hard-working motorists and help transform the economy in the south west and South Wales creating new opportunities and helping drive future growth. On Wednesday December , the Prince of Wales Bridge will reopen fully with two free-flowing lanes, with a mph speed limit to ensure the safety of drivers.

A poll of , teachers in England highlighted how austerity is blighting the lives of poorer families...with their shychildren bearing the brunt. One said: “Kids come in without winter coats even in the coldest weather.” Another added: “Struggling families get food packages, clothing and Christmas presents. We are starting a breakfast for every child.” Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, which carried out the survey, said: “This is a Dickensian picture of the poverty that far too many children and their families are having to endure.” Charles Dickens’ famous  novel Oliver Twist exposed the grinding poverty faced by many children in Victorian England. And now the spectre of want is ing to modern Britain.   Dr Bousted added: “The Government is out of touch with the new reality of children’s daily lives: with what it means to live without enough money for basics, such as food, shoes and adequate clothing. “The Government has failed to recognise the cost of cuts to schools, [to] children’s services and the social security system.” She urged “an urgent change to national policies”s and went on to blast the Tories for a “failure to address the in-work poverty faced by one in five.” More than six out  teachers said more families could not afford adequate winter clothes or shoes than three years ago. Nearly half said “holiday hunger” and housing issues, such as children living in shyovercrowded or temporary accommodation, were also worse than three years ago. And a shocking % said schools provide extra items for children and their hard-up families. One teacher said: “Good shoes are too expensive so students are coming in cheap shoes that last a few weeks at most. “I often have students asking meI can glue their shoes shyback together because the sole has fallen off.”   While one revealed that school attendance dropped to % after heavy rain “because shoes [were] damaged and many had no extra pair.” The survey said poverty was also contributing to more absences from school, behavioural issues, lack of concentration and pupils turning up late. North Denes Primary in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, have even started its own foodbank after noticing pupils were turning up hungry. Last night Angela Rayner, Labour’s Shadow Education Secretary, said: ”These figures paint a shocking picture of the impact of the Tories’ austerity on a generation of children. “Schools are being left to fend for themselves and deal with the consequences.” However the Government insisted: “Since  there are , fewer children living in absolute poverty, employment is at a record and we’re committed to ensuring every child gets the very best chances. “We spend pound billion a year on welfare to support those who need it most. On top of this, we’ve introduced funding to support disadvantaged shyfamilies in the holidays.” COMMENT: Time to end this monstrous injustice By Louisa McGeehan, Director of Policy, Child Poverty Action Group “There is no denying the prevalence of child poverty in our schools and some teachers’ experiences are absolutely heart breaking. We know that in a class of  children, on average  are growing up in poverty. This means missing out on opportunities to fulfil their potential and enjoy childhood, it also means sometimes going hungry or missing out on trips and other activities. Schools can’t address this alone - as a compassionate nation we need to re-invest in children and tackle child poverty urgently by restoring the value of child benefit, ending the freeze on social security benefits and abolishing the  child policy that discriminates unfairly against some children. The growth in in-work poverty is a particularly worrying trend. Because of zero-hour or short-hour contracts and increasingly insecure minimum wage work, many children are growing up in poverty when at least one of their parents work. Our recent research on the cost of a child in  found that  parents with  children working full-time on the national minimum wage still can’t earn enough to meet their family’s needs even at a minimum no-frills standard. A lone parent in the same position would need to work in a job paying at least an average wage to meet the family’s needs. This growth in in-work poverty means thatfamilies earn just above the threshold, their children miss out on free school meals. “It’s not just teachers who see first hand the impact of increasing child poverty. Our work with paediatricians found that children are sick as a direct result of being poor and the impact of this is lelong. Sometimes families can’t visit sick children in hospital because they can’t afford travel costs or to miss a day of work and some children couldn’t be sent home from hospital when medically fit because the family’s housing conditions are so bad. For instance, a child needing electrical medical equipment but there is only one socket available for the fridge, cooking and everything . “ “Le is getting tougher for low-income families and poverty has an effect on all parts of a child’s le. It doesn’t have to be this way - poverty isn’t inevitable. We have tackled it before and can do this againthere is the political will to do it. Today’s children deserve no less.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brit who vanished usa 30","story":"NewsBrit who vanished in USA  years ago feared murdered by suspected serial killerStephen Scane, a carpenter, emigrated to the United States in  after falling in love with an American girl - and a cold case investigation has revealed he may be one of up to eight people killed by Tracy PetrocelliShareCommentsByLouie Smith:,  DEC NewsSteve may be one of up to eight people killed by Tracy Petrocelli \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British man who disappeared in America  years ago is feared to have been murdered by a suspected serial killer. Carpenter Stephen Scane emigrated to the States in  after falling in love with a girl. He disappeared the following year and in  a shepherd found his skull hidden in undergrowth. A cold case investigation by two retired detectives has revealed Steve may be one of up to eight people killed by Tracy Petrocelli. The notorious killer, currently in jail for two murders, reportedly had the Brits credit card in his possession when he was arrested. An inquest into Steves death is due to be held this week to allow his skull to be buried. His uncle Derek Scane, , said: “It’s terrible it has taken so long to bury Stephen. He was a clever kid who seemed to be good at everything he did. “He fell in love with a girl and went out to America to be with her, but then he married someone . “We had contact every day with him until November in , but then we heard nothing. We were later told he was shot. “It is time we are allowed to lay Stephen to rest.”  Steves daily contact with his family ended and he was declared missing on December , . On August , , his skull and collarbone were discovered in a national forest park in Utah. Retired detectives Dean Carr and Mike Wilkinson discovered startling evidence about his death after reopening the cold case in . They say Petrocelli is linked to Steves murder by credit card receipts and scraps of paper found in his car when he was arrested. They also strongly suspect him of involvement in a further three murders. The detectives believe his six-month killing spree began when he shot dead his fiancee outside a restaurant. Speaking yesterdayDean said: I believe that Petrocelli and Mr Scane worked at the same truck stop or gas station together in Wyoming, they found Mr. Scane’s ID on Petrocelli, but could never quite tie him to the murder. At the time he was arrested, he had all of his victims identications in ious forms on him. Thats what disappoints me the most about the law enforcement agencies back then. They had the information and evidence on him at the time he was arrested. They had the gun. They had the victims identications. They had the credit cards, the receipts, all of that kind of stuff.  If they had taken the time to do more than just worry about their case and follow this up, all of this stuff would have been resolved back then. Petrocelli, now , murdered his fiancee before killing used car salesman James Wilson during a test drive of a car. He spent  years on death row before the death sentence was overturned, but remains in jail. Steves parents Gillian and Bryan received their sons remains many years ago. But they have been unable to hold a burial service until an inquest into his death has concluded. The hearing will take place in Taunton, Somerset, tomorrow . The inquest listing reads: Stephen Scane. Resident of Utah, USA, died on or about August  in USA aged  years.Inquest required to enable burial. Unlawfully killed. A spokesman for Summit County Sherf said Petrocelli remains a suspect in the murder of Stephen Roy Scane. They say he was interviewed in  and admitted knowing Stephen, but there was not sufficient evidence to charge him with the crime.

defeat at Livingston that kicked off the new manager’s time at the club.With that result in mind and Hamilton impressing in recent weeks, you’d be forgiven for thinking Parish had had his chance.However, Jim is delighted to have a tough decision to agonise over each week with two good goalies to choose from – evenhe admits Hamilton has shown his best form of the season recently.The Dens gaffer said: “Like any new player Jack’s probably taken a wee while to settle in at the club.“Both goalkeepers have been good, it’s been a close call to see who plays because both train really well and both are great lads.“I thought last week against Hamilton was Jack’s strongest game in everything he did.“People notice saves but there was a through ball where he was right off his line and his starting position was good and overall he was switched on.“You need to be at this level or you get punished.”He added: “I don’t think Jack had too many saves to make on Sunday against Rangers but he came and claimed a few crosses which helped out his back four.”"},{"url":null,"title":"keeping up pace is the plan forrelentless dee","story":"Paul McGowan wants to see Dundee keep up their “relentless” performances as they prepare for the toughest few weeks of the campaign.Five matches within the space of two weeks face the Dark Blues as they look to finish the year on a high.Getting themselves off the bottom of the Premiership, and the psychological boost that brings, has come at a perfect time for the Dens men ahead of a “tough week”, according to McGowan.On the back of four matches unbeaten, Dundee head to high-flyers Kilmarnock on Saturday before a midweek trip to Aberdeen followed by a clash with champions Celtic at Parkhead.Brendan Rodgers’ men have swept all before them domestically in recent weeks, including a - thumping of then-league leaders Killie last weekend.Despite that beating, McGowan expects a massive challenge at Rugby Park from Steve Clarke’s side.McGowan said: “It’ll be a tough week being away to Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and then Celtic.“That’s as hard as it comes at the moment.“Kilmarnock have been flying until the Celtic defeat, Aberdeen is a hard place to go and I can’t remember the last time Dundee won up there and then Celtic away doesn’t get any harder.“It’ll be dficult for us but we got a result against Rangers to keep the confidence going.“If we take each game at a time then who knows ”After that, the Dark Blues bring  to a close with two home games, firstly welcoming Livingston to the Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip up the A on December .Despite being mired in a relegation battle heading into these fixtures, the feeling around the ground is upbeat after Dundee’s upturn in form.After a slow start under manager Jim McIntyre, the work done behind the scenes has begun to pay idends on the pitch as they look much more solid defensively and potent in attack.That’s been helped by the scoring form of striker Kenny Miller, though McGowan says he and the rest of his team-mates need to start adding to the goal tally to get themselves out of trouble.He added: “As a unit we’ve been hard to beat but we also look dangerous in attack.“We’re going down the flanks, attacking with numbers and getting numbers in the box so you can see the work is starting to pay off for us.“We’ve started to score goals – Kenny has been banging them in and others are chipping in.“Jesse Curran got his first goal, I was delighted for him against Hamilton but we all need to chip in.“You can see the boys are buying into what we are trying to do and you can see how hard we are working on the pitch.”Dundee were impressive in defence to hold a Rangers side with a man advantage last Sunday and McGowan knows they’ll have to repeat that type of performance throughout the games this week.The midfielder, though, rejects any idea of Dundee becoming a counter-attacking side.He said: “I don’t think we are necessarily a counter-attacking team, I think when we win the ball we attack at pace and we are being relentless.“We can keep the ball as wellwe need to and we can mix our game up well.“We did that well against Hamilton, knowing when to go and when not to go.

It is never going to go.People say racism is taught.At a certain age it is taught.If you are three, four, five, six, seven, eight and you come out with something that you have obviously heard around the home and people you are around, I get that.That stuff withSterling and Scotty Sinclair, the stuff with me. You are not taught that.That one who did that against Sterling. He has chosen to say those things, to try to say the most hateful and hurtful things to somebody.The person in the Scott Sinclair video.That guy is taking a penalty against Aberdeen and he doesn’t want him to score against his team.But why would you ever bring up somebody’s race  I have arguments with loads of people and it doesn’t once cross my mind to bring in what colour I am looking at. Because when I am looking at someone I am looking at a human being.It doesn’t matter what colour they are. So to say something like that, it is your choice.When you are an adult and you get past  to  anything you then come out with or your actions, it’s all down to choice from you.Anything that comes out of your mouth no one can make you say that, unless you choose to say it.It is never going to be gone.I’m not going to say it might be the next game or the next game but there will be a time in a game when somebody feels they want to choose to say something like that.For me you can stand and say it in my face, it doesn’t bother me.I just highlight it because I just want people to know that people like that are still out there.Whether it is an Aberdeen fan saying it against a Celtic player, Rangers player, Hibs player or Dundee player. It is irrelevant who is saying it because I will never be on their side whether they are an Aberdeen fan or not.In this day, it is  and I just think it is despicable.You have to choose your words correctly.If you want to say it, say it – but you will be judged on it.This guy who did it against Sterling had a nice job but he chose to say a word against a player who is playing against his football team.Now he has lost it. Is it really worth it  No.No. It is not just in football, you get it in all forms of le. Football is a job. You are going to get it in a factory, get it in a swimming pool, a library.Racism happens all over and it is a choice. It is sad that it is still going on nowadays but poverty and unemployment are happening now. Things can be done to help prevent itand try to make it better but it is always going to be there.Bullying, poverty, racism you will never get a world when that isn’t there.For me personally I bring up my kiddies and I want them to respect everybody.I always say, show respect to anybody who shows you respect.Andthey don’t show respect walk away from them.You don’t have to be around people like that. If everyone had that idea, I don’t think everyone does, then it would be a better place. That sort of thing might not happen so much, but I guarantee it will happen again.Yes, loads of times.Even now people say about the Tonev thing, there was no proof. But there was proof.They didn’t see the video recordings of the game in the room that we were all in. So they don’t know what has gone on.I would never try to say anyone did anything to me racist to ruin anyone’s career.I am not that person.So when I go and get a ball and people are shouting at me I don’t report it. It is irrelevant to me.You can say whatever you like about me, I’m playing a game of football and you are trying to hurt me.We are probably winning the game and that is why you are upset.Becauseyour team are winning you are not going to say anything.It is only when the chips are down, you are frustrated, that those sort of things come out. Loads of times people have said things.And you know what  It hasn’t been the bigger games and it seems to be against the same sort of teams.I don’t ever bring it up.You can say it to my face and I walk away. It doesn’t bother me.That is what I put up with – it is water off a duck’s back.I am black, I get that.My kiddies are black. I have a white mum, my dad’s black.I have a white nan, I have a white brother.It doesn’t matter to me what colour you are.I love all sorts of people and I show anybody respect who shows me respect.Tonev did not show me respect so I showed him no respect in terms of I reported that. Because he is a professional footballer and at the time there were four or five black people on his team.So you have just said that to me.It was a lack of respect.It is what it is, you don’t cry about spilt milk and that stuff is in the past.I am sure there will be, maybe not towards me, but there will be racism in the game.You just have to deal with it.I think there are bigger issues as well such as the situation with Leigh Grfiths who is struggling with depression or habits.He needs help.Someone shouting things at me, I am of the mindset that it is not affecting my le or my career.Leigh is in a position where the stuff is affecting his le so the focus needs to go on that.Things where people feel in a position where they are really struggling with le.With just getting out of bed.People see him driving a flash car, playing football for a big club but they don’t see behind it when he is at home.When in his head he is thinking all these things.They are the sort of people who need help and I hope he can get all the help he needs."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/12/5c10b2f08aa06-e1544626533279-867x564.jpg ","title":"aberdeen twins celebrate 85th birthday","story":"Although Irene Strachan couldn’t be more dferent than her twin Sheila Mathieson, she was thrilled to celebrate her th birthday with her.Irene’s daughter Arlene Johnstone, , said the fondest memory she had of her mother and aunt were the fabulous house parties they used to have.So it seemed only right to throw a big party for her mother and her twin to celebrate their th birthday.Irene said: “We had a party and we both enjoyed ourselves.

She married and had two sons, Stephen, , and Mark, .She was toto Kemnay in  after she orced and remained happily single for the next  years.For James, after  years in Perth, he set forth to travel throughout south Australia, when he signed up for his national service.He married in , had two daughters, Cynnamon, and Konaquin, , but was to orce after six years of marriage.“I spent the next  years living in Queensland,” said James, who had worked as a mechanical fitter.Fate’s hand presented itself to James in  when he was bequeathed a sum of money from a long-lost great aunt who lived in America.James, who had always hankered for Scotland, knew exactly what he should do with his windfall.“I was a little scared when it came to finally coming home to Scotland because I was worried I wouldn’t want to go back to Australia,” he admitted.“My aunt Sheila still lived in Kemnay and I hadn’t seen her in years and decided to surprise her.“Although I had thought of Ann over the years, I never gave thought she would still be living there.”As James set out on the same bus route he had last taken to Kemnay  years earlier, wonderful memories flooded his mind.“It felt like I was going back to visit grandma’s house and it was wonderful to recognise a few houses which remain to this day,” he said.Fate once more intervened, when James arrived only to discover aunt Sheila was actually in hospital having a hip replacement operation.When Ann discovered James was home at his aunt’s house, she popped along to say hello, and the six decades simply melted away.They remain young in each other’s eyes and are both still captivated with each other.“Within three months, James had sold up his house in Australia and came back to Kemnay,” laughed Ann.“He was supposed to stay with his aunt, but that never happened.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"the adventures of mr toad a ribbitting performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowBy Anne BeckittThe Mid Argyll Musical Society recently showcased their production of The Adventures of Mr Toad in Ardrishaig Hall to great acclaim.The praise was well-justied for the whole production was a shining example of what real teamwork can make from good material.The cast included primary and secondary students as well as adults, covering very ied levels of stage experience, yet they all worked together with a smoothness that appeared effortless but was, in fact, the result of much care and expert guidance.The chorus was as well rehearsed as the principal characters, and the evident enjoyment of every actor and singer meant the audience could relax totally and enjoy it all.Even lost lines, and the problems of dealing bravely with injuries were easily managed with good humour that won all hearts. That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

And this type of attack has become all too common in Scotland.We all think our slobbering pooch would never be capable of attacking anything but, given the right circumstances, any dog, no matter how placid, will revert to instinct and could chase a farm animal. When in a state of excitement and aggression, a dog may then choose to attack a human being, and we are into another ball game entirely.The solution seems simple # keep control of your dog at all times and have it on a lead around livestock. As Brian Walker himself said, it is a very small minority of people who disregard these basic precautions, but that minority is growing in number.People love to moan about the dark days, wet weather and lack of entertainment.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

Judge Lord Kinclaven told first offender Summers: “You have been found guilty of a serious sexual offence and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.” Summers, who was placed on the sex offenders register, worked at Glasgow Prestwick Airport as general manager for air traffic control and then in  became managing director at Norwich Airport in England. Recently he was working as a practice manager at a GP surgery in Glasgow. Solicitor advocate Murray Macara QC said: “He maintains he did not rape this woman and maintains that whatever sexual conduct took place was of a limited nature and was consensual. Mr Macara handed over a dozen testimonials from work colleagues of Summers. The QC said that his client objected to some of the comments in the background report compiled on him which referred to him a displaying toxic masculinity” and described him as a misogynist. Mr Macara said that Summers was highly thought of at work. He went on: “He worked as an air traffic controller and had senior managerial roles at two airports.

She said took her hand and took her into the bedroom which was pitch black and added: “I tried to push him away with both hands. I repeatedly said No, this is not happening.” When Summers fell asleep his terried victim managed to get out of the bed and get dressed. The womans daughter said her mother was distressed and crying and told her she had been raped and police were called. When quizzed by police Summers denied all responsibility for any rape and said that there was consensual sexual intercourse that evening. The GP practice in Glasgow where Summers was employed as a practice manager said: His employment was terminated at the end of last month after his conviction for rape.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSex crimeAyrCourtsAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"straiton primary headteacher commended impressive","story":"NewsStraiton Primary and headteacher commended with impressive reportLiz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging.ShareByLochlin Highet:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsStraiton Primary Head teacher Liz Candlish \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school and nursery has been commended by HM Inspectors for the high quality of education they provide. A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

been supporting Campbeltown Sailing Club throughout the inception and evolution of Kintyre Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Mayrsquos approval ratings outstrip Corbynrsquos terrible numbers.The Tories have a plausible excuse for their disarray. The UKrsquos relationship with the European Union has obsessed the Conservatives for over thirty years. A sizeable number of Mayrsquos colleagues got into politics because they wanted the country to withdraw from the EU. It is the one issue on which some Tory MPs will never compromise.Labour is not encumbered by this historical baggage and is unashamedly pro-European. The partyrsquos members and parliamentarians overwhelmingly want to stay in the EU and would breathe a collective sigh of reliefCorbyn moved onto this ground.Labourrsquos sliding scale of priorities for Brexit - get a better deal than May, force a general election or, as an absolute last resort, campaign for a second referendum - reflects the ide between the membership and the leadership.Party sources say the obstacle to Labour adopting an anti-Brexit position is Corbyn and his loyal aides, Seamus Milne and Karie Murphy. Corbyn is a lelong Eurosceptic whose ill-feeling towards the EU is stronger than the mild distaste for the project displayed by members of the Prime Ministers Cabinet. Deep in his gut, he feels that Brexit is an opportunity.In lsquoAll Out Warrsquo, a book by journalist Tim Shipman on the craziness of Westminster politics after the referendum, the author recounted one of the hustings during the  Labour leadership contest that led to Corbynrsquos victory. Askedthey would rule out voting No or campaigning for Brexit ahead of a referendum on the EU, every candidate did so, apart from Corbyn. ldquoNo I wouldnrsquot rule it out, he said.Part of the blame for the paralysis at Westminster can be laid at Corbynrsquos door. Given that May will not get her draft deal past her own party, and given that she is unlikely to be the person tasked with producing a radically dferent option, it seems obvious that any solution must involve Labour.And yet, despite Brexit being the most important issue in UK politics since the second world war, Labourrsquos position appears to be to sit on the sidelines and wait for a Tory implosion to lead to a general election. It is a strategy based on the hope that some Conservative MPs are stupid enough to want to bring down their own Government.The alternative, which left-wingers like shadow chancellor John McDonnell appear to realise, is clear. Corbyn could point to the fact that a clear majority of his voters want to remain in the UK. Labour could contrast the  promises made during the referendum with the shambles that has ensued. They could conclude, just as the SNP did eventually, that a final referendum is required.Whatever happens over the next three weeks, the parliamentary arithmetic dictates that Brexit is no longer an inevitability. Once Mayrsquos deal dies, only two options could carry a majority in the House of Commons: a softer Brexit that would mean retaining freedom of movement or another referendum. The first would be unpalatable to voters, while the second,offered as a choice between a harder Brexit or remaining in the UK, would be an easier sell.Labourrsquos choice is between sitting passively in the back seat, or grabbing hold of the steering wheel and, to use a well worn phrase, taking back control. Otherwise Corbyn, like May, could become another casualty of history."},{"url":null,"title":"westminster-leaders-urge-corbyn-to-join-united-front-against-may","story":"Ian Blackford, Vince Cable, Liz Saville Roberts and Caroline Lucas, who represent the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens, urged Corbyn to attend a summit tomorrow on opposing the Conservatives.Theresa May pulled a vote last week on her draft withdrawal agreement on leaving the EU after it became clear MPs in her own party would help defeat the proposal.Her decision, which angered euro-sceptics on her own benches, triggered an internal confidence vote, which she won despite over a third of her own MPs voting to bring her down.Subsequent talks with EU negotiators, based on her wish to clary the Northern Irish lsquobackstoprsquo proposal in the agreement, collapsed after May and her counterparts failed to reach an agreement.The Government has now said there will be a vote on whichever deal she presents to Parliament in January.However, despite the disarray, the Opposition parties at Westminster have failed to agree on a cross-party strategy to put maximum pressure on the Prime Minister.Both the SNP and Labour support a no confidence vote in the Government, but cannot agree on the timing.The Nationalists and the Liberal Democrats also back a referendum on the final deal, while Labour has said a second vote is an option.In a joint letter, Blackford, Cable, Saville Roberts and Lucas have asked Corbyn to attend a meeting in Westminster tomorrow to discuss the UK governmentrsquos current position on Brexit.They wrote: ldquoIt is absolutely clear that the Government now is unwilling to give Parliament a say on the meaningful vote before the Christmas period. With recess fast approaching, the Prime Minister is running down the clock in a hope to offer a binary choice of her deal or no deal.ldquoWhile each of us hold many dferent positions, we share the common view that the Prime Ministers deal should be defeated and that a no deal should be removed from the table. There are other options and we must ensure that as opposition parties we put that challenge to the Prime Minister.ldquoNo party can achieve a result that will deliver in the countrys interests working alone. At this critical time, we must work together.Meanwhile, one of Corbynrsquos own MPs has urged his leader to \"come off the fence\" and back another vote on EU membership.Speaking to the BBC, Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South, said he believed a call for a second referendum - or Peoples Vote - could command a majority in the House of Commonssupported by the Labour frontbench.Other parties have been pressing Corbyn to call a motion of no confidence in Mays Government.

Up until the s, when the holiday was focussed on religion and the birth of Christ, we hardly bothered with it as a nation - but once Christmas started to become much more secular we fell under its spell.lsquoAs far as Scotland is concerned,rsquo says Professor Sir Tom Devine, one of the nationrsquos leading historians and public intellectuals, \"Christmas is a recent event.rsquo In Scotland, after the Protestant reformation in the s, he says, Catholic holidays like Christmas and Saintsrsquo Days were abolished, and hostility to do with anything seen as lsquoPoperyrsquo intensied in the s during the Convenanting period.Scotland lsquowas much more hardline and uncompromisingrsquo in its Protestantism than England - and so while Christmas grew south of the border, it barely existed here.lsquoThe Scottish festival was New Year unambiguously,rsquo Devine says. It wasnrsquot until  that Christmas was made a public holiday in Scotland. Devine, a schoolboy in the s, recalls going to class on Christmas Day.It was the Victorians who created the idea of the modern Christmas - with trees, holly, a big family meal and present giving. lsquoImmediately before the Victorian era, Scotland had experienced five successive Jacobite risings,rsquo says Devine. These th century rebellions created a lsquoferocity of hatredrsquo and intensied the anti-Catholic sentiment in Scotland, helping keep Christmas in abeyance.The path to  when Christmas was finally welcomed in from the cold was laid by the tragedy of two world wars, Devine explains. The conflicts were lsquoa very good mixing processrsquo for Scots, Devine says, and gave young men away at war their first experience of the traditions of Christmas. The influence of ex-soldiers lsquoprepared the way for that watershed date in rsquo.Devine says that from the s onwards the story of Christmas in Scotland has been one of lsquoconquest over all other festivalsrsquo, however, he adds: lsquoThere is a very considerable irony in that Christmas has become so core as a national festival while at the same time losing much of its religious meaning.rsquoDevine, a practising Catholic, despairs at lsquothe taking out of Christ from Christmasrsquo. He sees this as a lsquoreflection of the horrible hedonistic materialism of modern lersquo.For Devine and his family, the holiday season has been tinged with more than a little sadness for many years since one of his children, John, took his own le during the Christmas period in the s. Just a week ago, though, a newly adopted grandchild came along. There will be  people over for dinner at the Devine house - all the children and grandchildren - and this year Christmas will be lsquoa magical experiencersquo, he says.CHRISTMAS AND RELIGION IN For Rev Sally Foster Fulton Christmas is revolutionary. Fulton, one of the most influential voices in the Church of Scotland and head of Christian Aid Scotland, sees Christmas as about the poorest and the weakest lsquospeaking truth to powerrsquo.Whether someone is an atheist or a believer, the Nativity story has a strongly subversive message. In the story, says Fulton, lsquothe angels bring the good news first to the shepherds who were on the edge of society, they were the poorest of the poorrsquo. The Nativity, she says, lsquois a huge challenge to power, and it poses a huge challenge to us to come together and stand up for a dferent worldrsquo.lsquoThe central heart of the story,rsquo she says, lsquois that vulnerable love is more powerful than those we deem powerful. There is a subversive wisdom that turns what we think on its head - that might makes right, than money creates happiness. The Nativity story flips that, and says no hellip the story is about Godrsquos love for humanity and our love for each other - the potential for us to embrace each other in a way that transforms the world.rsquoFulton explains thatwe study the Nativity story we will find the revolutionary message hidden in the text. She points out that Jesus is described as lsquothe Son of Godrsquo and lsquothe Prince of Peacersquo - but these were also terms used to describe Caesar when Judea was occupied by imperial Rome. She says the story is asking the reader lsquowhere are you going to put your belief  Behind power and might  Or are you going to put your belief in love and forgiveness and vulnerability and equalityrsquo.But the story didnrsquot just speak to Jewish people  years ago, she says. It asks questions of people today as well. lsquoWhat does Caesar look like today rsquo Fulton asks. lsquoWhere are you going to put your love and effort rsquoFulton is not a dogmatic preacher, and she believes secular Scotland can embrace the central message of the Nativity without having to worship God. lsquoThe Christmas story has so many deep truths which are not dependent on historical fact,rsquo she says. lsquoThe power of the story is not dependent on whether you believe it is factually correct.rsquoFor Fulton, Christmas should also be about old-fashioned fun as well. However, what she doesnrsquot want lsquois the power and opportunity to live dferently to be covered over by all the crackers and wrapping paperrsquo.WHY WE TELL STORIES AT CHRISTMASCHRISTMAS is a time of make-believe, of story-telling. To some extent, says Dominic Hill the artistic director of the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow, Christmas itself is one great fiction. lsquoTherersquos a guy who comes down your chimney,rsquo says Hill, who is currently directing A Christmas Carol, lsquoand we buy into it, we buy into a complete fiction, just the same as we buy into a piece of theatre. Christmas is like a collective theatre in our collective unconscious - we are all sharing in something which we know is an act of ritual and fiction.rsquoA Christmas Carol is one of the founding texts of Christmas - itrsquos the blueprint not just of what we should do on Christmas Day, but how we should feel, it taps directly into the heart and soul of Christmas. Itrsquos perfect for adaption into a Christmas play. Most pantos have nothing to do with Christmasyou look at their plot.Christmas is also a time when people who wouldnrsquot usually go to the theatre pay to see a show - as theatre-going has become part of the ritual of Christmas along with the turkey and the carols. At its heart Dickensrsquo story is about kindness winning through in a dark world, about the unbeatable goodness in human beings, and about the magical alchemy of Christmas which can turn even the worst person into a decent soul.lsquoAt Christmas,rsquo says Hill, lsquoI want people to go away from the theatre feeling Christmassy - warm and fuzzy and loving their fellow man.rsquo A Christmas Carol, he says, lsquois a cry for sympathy, generosity and understanding of our fellow human beings. Irsquom afraid that the fundamental issues it deals with - of a world driven not by understanding and sympathy but by money - is as relevant as ever before.rsquoDickens originally intended to write a political pamphlet, says Hill, but realised he could make his point better with fiction. lsquoHis aim was to get to the mind and engage with a problem by engaging with peoplersquos hearts and that is both the power and role of theatre and fiction and art.rsquoLike Christmas itself, Dickensrsquo novel presents this time of year as an alternative world - as a time when anything can happen. Just as in the movie Itrsquos a Wonderful Le, Hill points out, Scrooge like George Bailey is shown an alternative world and an alternative version of himself. It is about change, and peoplersquos ability to change for the better. lsquoWith fiction we can make right the wrongs of the world,rsquo says Hill - which is what Christmas is all about.THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CHRISTMASHUMANS need Christmas - or at least a festival like it, an event at the end of the year, when we try to be better people, when we connect to each other, an occasion which quite literally brings a little light into the dark.Scottish clinical psychologist Dr Simon Stuart says: lsquoAll humans have an innate desire for things to make sense, and there is a huge amount of evidence that we need to be part of a group. Christmas is the key part of our end of year ritual, and we humans are very good at thinking symbolically, so when the end of the year rolls around we want to mark that, and there is something very comforting in the narrative that we tell ourselves of things feeling alright, that things make sense, evenit is just for one day.lsquoChristmas allows us to feel the safety and warmth that,we were lucky, we felt as children. It is an excuse to let go of grim daily responsibilities and to enjoy simple pleasures like just being with people we love.rsquoPerhaps the key to Christmas is that it lets adults feel childlike, to play even - think of all those board games brought out on Boxing Day. lsquoChristmas,rsquo says Stuart, lsquoallows us to get in touch with the good things in childhood we are no longer in touch with. Play is something we let go terribly as adults and Christmas is a playful time.rsquoPlay connects us to other people, it helps us deal with the dficult parts of le, and play, like so much about Christmas, mostly centres on spending time with those we love.lsquoChristmas is predictable and secure and has rituals which go with it - it allows us to feel at peace and safe,rsquo says Stuart. Yet for all the psychological benefits it gives us,we do Christmas wrong -we feel everything has to be perfect - it will cause us more pain and upset than joy and happiness.People who think their child will only be happythey spend a fortune on presents, or those who fret about the perfect lunch, are missing the point. A racist uncle or spoiled brat nephew are part of the deal, as they are part of your le.lsquoWe cling to this idea that we must be happy,rsquo says Stuart, lsquoand to be happy we have to push away all the sadness, but what is most psychologically healthy is being able to make room for all things - good and bad - in recognition of what the human condition involves. If we accept that Christmas is never going to be perfect, that imperfection is part of the ritual, that might be a more psychologically flexible way to go into the festive season.rsquoGratitude, family and simplicity are what Christmas is about for Stuart. lsquoItrsquos a time when we are able to get in touch with what matters,rsquo he says. The sad thing is, he feels, that when Christmas ends we let go of this uncomplicated lesson.lsquoThis time of year reminds us of what it is to be a contented human being living out our values and that for me is the real magic of Christmas,rsquo he adds.THE ROOTS OF CHRISTMASAS an anthropologist who studies what makes humans human, Christmas and its rituals are especially revealing to Professor Richard Baxstrom of Edinburgh University. A culture becomes real when it shares rituals, he says, and all of us participating in a ritual like Christmas binds us together.It is like a cultural anchor, buried in the past. Nostalgia is at the heart of Christmas. The holiday takes old traditions that our great grandparents had and recreates them anew every year. Where your grandparents attended a Christmas Eve church service to hear a message of hope, you maybe watch Itrsquos a Wonderful Le with your children to hear the same message of hope.lsquoChristmas is an address to our ancestors,rsquo says Baxstrom, lsquothe coherence of a group depends on its ability to make that address together -you donrsquot do that then the claim to be alike, to be part of the same group, starts to suffer as you lose understanding of what you really share.lsquoAn address to the dead, to the ancestors - whether a generation ago or a millennia ago - is an important part of any cultural group. I donrsquot know of any group that wouldnrsquot in some way address themselves to those who existed before as a way of dealing with the present.rsquoWithout rituals like Christmas, he says, lsquowhat will you be left with rsquoTHE HIDDEN CHRISTIAN MEANINGS IN CHRISTMASMany symbols of Christmas are obvious - like the star on top of your tree representing the star over Bethlehem at the birth of Christ. But others are not so clear.Take the tradition of candy canes, often hung from the tree. Have you ever asked yourself - why is the sweet shaped like a cane  Well, it is to commemorate the shepherds who were first told of the nativity. The cane represents a shepherdrsquos crook.The giving of gts at Christmas is often linked to the Three Wise Men who brought gold, frankincense and myrrh for Christ - but what about the bows we put on presents  The bow is meant to represent that all of humanity should be lsquotiedrsquo together.Therersquos a lot of red and green at Christmas as well, isnrsquot there  The red symbolises the blood of Jesus spilt on the cross, and the green stands for the idea of everlasting le.What about holly - why do we bring the spiky plant inside over the holidays. Well, the holly and its jagged leaves represents the thorns worn by Christ on the cross.Bells tend to make an appearance at Christmas also - because bells represent the announcement of the birth of Christ by the angels.THE HIDDEN PAGAN MEANINGS IN CHRISTMASChristmas is as much about our pre-Christian past as it is about Christianity. Christmas Carols can trace their roots back to pagan fertility rites when men and women wandered through fields in mid-winter singing songs to drive away spirits that might harm the crops.Mistletoe comes straight from the Druids - it was one of their most magical plants. Roman fertility rites took place beneath mistletoe and thatrsquos translated into a kiss under the mistletoe at a Christmas party today.The Christmas tree goes right back to the Roman midwinter festival of Saturnalia when the king of the gods Saturn was honoured by bringing greenery into the home.The Yule log goes back to our ancient nordic and germanic roots when on the night of the winter solstice a giant log would be placed on the hearth to burn until the dawn, celebrating theof the sun to the earth each year.Father Christmas himself is about as pagan as you can get.

Not an army like what you saw in Goma, looting, raping and killing its own people, he told me, referring to recent events in the provincial capital from where I had just come and his forces were threatening to overrun.Nkunda himself, of course, was no Mr Nice Guy. As well as an alleged penchant for disposing of his rivals by having them tied inside sacks and thrown into Lake Kivu, he and his men were subsequently blamed for many other human rights abuses.That day throughout our chat he clenched the black, silver-topped cane that had become one of his trademarks. It struck me that he seemed fond of theatrical props like this, in much the same way as former Congolese president and strongman, Mobutu Sese Seko, was with his leopard skin hat and leather walking stick.In the end Nkunda, who was finally betrayed and arrested in neighbouring Rwanda, never did overthrow President Kabila, but the standoff between the two men typied the volatile nature of Congorsquos seemingly interminable power struggles.Kabila, who remains DRC president to this day, is currently seeing the country through yet another turbulent period as later this week it goes to the polls in what will be a crucial and controversial election.Having held power for almost  years ever since taking over from his father, Laurent-Desire Kabila, another authoritarian figure, Joseph Kabila is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term.Under the constitution, his two-term presidency was supposed to end in  but Kabila has managed to delay the coming election by two years.Should, however, the poll this time really mark his departure as president, he still hasnrsquot ruled out the possibility of running again in , a prospect that horries many Congolese.ldquoIt will be a catastrophe for the republic, because for  years his regime was characterised by corruption, impunity and the violation of human rights, said Georges Kapiamba, president of the rights group, Congolese Association for the Access to Justicespeaking last week to the New York Times.Ever since the previous electoral delays, Kabilarsquos political opponents have accused the Congolese leader of overstaying his welcome, and of using his security forces to violently repress protesters who demanded his departure two years ago.His continuation as a contested caretaker president has only fuelled feverish speculation that he might still be plotting to tweak the constitution and seek a third consecutive term.Itrsquos perhaps not surprising then that despite Kabilarsquos assurances to the contrary, there remains some considerable unease as to what lies in store during this weekrsquos poll.That disquiet only grew over the past few days following a mysterious fire in the capital Kinshasa that destroyed , electronic voting machines ndash % of the citys stock ndash just  days ahead of the presidential election.The ruined machines were among , due to be used in the vote, according to DRC electoral commission chief, Corneille Nangaa.Made by a South Korean company and being used in DRC for the first time, the machines have raised concerns that they may be more vulnerable to vote rigging than paper ballots.Given the scarcity of electricity in many regions of a country two-thirds the size of Western Europe, there are worries also that swathes of the population could be disenfranchised.The unease over the election also comes as the country struggles to cope with other major problems. Not least among these is the spread of the deadly Ebola virus that is now the second-biggest outbreak ever, after the vast epidemic that swept through the West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between  and .ldquoThis is a milestone nobody wanted to hit, World Health Organisationspokesman Tarik Jasarevic said in statement recently, stressing that the risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the DRC as well as to neighbouring countries, ldquoremains very high.The international humanitarian response to the growing Ebola outbreak has been stymied by the violence that for years now has gripped swathes of eastern Congo.Unlike during the West African Ebola epidemic, health workers in Congo are sometimes forced to don body armour and helmets so subjected are they to attack from armed groups while working to prevent the diseasersquos spread.ldquoArmed groups pose an enormous obstacle for our staff, says Michel Yao, the WHOrsquos response coordinator in the city of Beni in North Kivu provincethe epicentre of the outbreak.To reach at least  % of Ebola-affected areas, health workers need armed police or UN peacekeeping troop escorts, he confirmed.As has been the case for many years now, nothing about DRC either in terms of the countryrsquos physical scale or that of its myriad problems is anything short of complex and enormous.At least  million people are in need of humanitarian assistance according to the UN, a need up there on a par with Syria and Yemen that has doubled in the last year alone.As ever, conflict lies largely at the heart of the problem. In huge parts of DRC especially the east, civilians are confronted daily by massacres, persistent and recurring displacement, rape, kidnappings, human trafficking, house burning and a proleration of foreign and local armed groups.Ironically, itrsquos in great part precisely because so much of eastern Congo is so rich in natural resources that two million children are at risk of starvation and . million people have fled their homes because of recent fighting.Time and again while visiting the country I like so many other have been struck by the gulf between the nationrsquos prodigious mineral wealth and the grinding poverty and insecurity of most of DRCrsquos more than  million people.In the midst of such natural wealth there have always been those warlords like Laurent Nkunda and others before and since, who have been only too willing to fight for the spoils on behalf of themselves and others.In eastern Congo alone there are estimated to be more than  armed groups and many are heavily interconnected. In this labyrinthine conflict not only are ethnic and tribal dferences exploited, but shting allegiances and erse agendas are commonplace with many fighters crossing the border to and from neighbouring countries like Uganda and Rwanda.Both these regional neighbours and nations further afield have long had their sights on Congorsquos estimated  trillion in natural resources.As David Pilling, Africa editor of the Financial Times, recently observed: ldquoThe Westrsquos role is hardly edying. It has grown used to Congorsquos simmering tragedy. So long as mining companies can work with the next regime, it will be happy enough.Right now Congo has become the worldrsquos biggest producer of cobalt, a vital component of smartphones and electric car batteries, and Africarsquos biggest copper exporter. It is also awash with gold, diamonds, oil and coltan, the last another vital ingredient for components in our digital age.In the struggle for control over the resource-rich northeast of Congo, many areas have been effectively rendered ungovernable despite the presence of some , UN peacekeeping troops.In recent weeks and months armed groups have massacred many civilians in and around the Ebola-wracked area of Beni. In Ituri Province too, on the border with Uganda, there has been a wave of fighting, atrocities committed and mass graves discovered. While ethnic dferences often underpin some of this violence, experts say this new wave of violence especially in Ituri does not follow the usual pattern of ethnic killings and reprisals.According to survivors of the attacks on villages the attackers are men speaking languages from other regions and are often equipped with new weapons and expensive communications equipment, suggesting the fighters have powerful backers who may be looking to exploit the animosity between two ethnic groups the Lendu and Hema for their own purposes.Among the explanations for the violence increasingly touted by locals, civil society and political activists in both Ituri and North Kivu provinces is that president Joseph Kabila and his allies want to destabilise the east of the country in order to postpone this weekrsquos elections.Another explanation is that Kabilarsquos motives are shaped also by being part of a corrupt network involving both DRC and other countries mining, banking and telecommunications industries, and that prolonging instability is actually a means of keeping control over the areas.ldquoTherersquos no one narrative that explains it all, Ida Sawyer, the Central Africa director for Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying.This is a view shared by other major monitoring and analysis groups among them the UK based International Institute for Strategic Studies .In a report earlier this year in which what it describes as ldquocalculated destabilisation IISS says that the ldquoDRCrsquos large territory and the limitations of its security forces have impelled its leaders to employ the ide-and-rule tactics of manipulation, destabilisation and deal-making to establish and maintain relative control.The IISS analyses also points to how local and national politicians play ethnic groups against each other including in North Kivu and Ituri provinces and how the Congolese army provides weapons and equipment, and also conducts operations that are later blamed on rebel groups.As for Kabila himself, the UK think tank says he enjoys the support of his political party, controls all major Congolese institutions and has confidants in key positions, from the lucrative state-owned mining company Gecamines to the electoral commission.ldquoThrough multiple reshuffles of leadership, Kabila has tightened his grip on the security forces, making a coup very unlikely and providing him with an effective instrument to suppress mass protests and political opposition, IISS concluded.Which brings us back to this weekrsquos elections, where although Kabila appears to be willing to stand down he has nominated Emmanuel Shadary to keep his seat warm until he can run again in .Shadary a former interior minister whose name resonates little beyond political circles in DRC, is considered to be a hard liner. Shadary is also said to have been chosen because he is malleable and has weak ties to the Congolese army and security services, two forces deeply loyal to Kabila.As for the opposition standing in this weekrsquos ballot, Shadaryrsquos two main rivals Martin Fayulu and Felix Tshisekedi could on a level playing field give Kabilarsquos placeman a run for his money, but a level playing field is one thing the election will certainly not be.Already tensions are running high with the UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, urging Kabilarsquos government on Friday to ldquosend a clear signal that threats and violence against political opponents will not be tolerated.Ten years ago sitting in that hut in Kichanga with rebel leader Laurent Nkunda he told me that, ldquoinstead of being ruled by those who would have us live in poverty forever, you have to suffer for freedom sometimes.Nkunda was never a legitimate voice for freedom or democracy nor did he care for impoverished Congolese. Joseph Kabila one suspects is much the same.As the FTrsquos David Pilling writing this week wryly put it ldquo two days before Christmas, voters in sub-Saharan Africarsquos largest country by area will attempt the impossible. They will try to put the ldquodemocratic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.After two decades under the Kabila family rule itrsquos hard to see this happening smoothly,indeed at all."},{"url":null,"title":"cool-list-festive-days-out","story":"SEC, GlasgowBilling itself as Europersquos largest indoor funfair, the Irn-Bru carnival opens on Thursday at Glasgowrsquos SEC ndash so only four more sleeps to go, kids ndash and offers a cornucopia of thrills and delights.Pluck up your courageyou want to take on rides such as the Top Flip, the Speed Buzz, the Midnight Express Matterhorn or new additions the Rotor and Airmaxx , or try some of the more sedate attractions.

In October, Mr Brown predicted a future referendum on Brexit will take place. He saidBritain leaves the EU without a deal in March  but with, as he expects, an extended transition period retaining some aspects of membership, the next general election will be fought on Europe.Tony BlairThe Labour heavyweight drew Mrs Mayrsquos ire after saying the Prime Minister must stop ldquobanginghead against this brick wall and go for a second referendum.

The issue was highlighted in the Courier of November  and Highland Council made aware of the most recent spate of vandalism in which first-floor windows were broken.A former janitor had confronted boys throwing stones at the windows and had previously alerted police when he saw people walking about on the roof of the former technical department.Speaking about her efforts to make the building safe, Councillor Sinclair said: \"I first asked for this work to be done several months ago but officers in every department are very stretched both for time and money, so I am pleased that the work has finally been completed and thank the people involved, both council and contractor.\"However, she stressed that it was only a \"small step forward\" and that it should \"not take elected members months of asking to have this small amount of work done\".She said: \"The council as a whole needs to consider whether it has become so bureaucratic and centralised that it effectively disempowers its own members. I hope our new chief executive will take radical steps to shake things up and deliver the localism we have been promised.\"She went on to say how she is now considering a motion to the council that commits it to having a better-planned exit strategy for its estates. \"Too many town centres are falling into a state of terrible decline,\" Councillor Sinclair said. \"Often that is to do with market forces and therefore beyond our control, but when its council land contributing to that decline we have a responsibility to address it.\"A council spokesperson said: \"The property was boarded up to try and prevent further vandalism.\"Initially we boarded up all the ground-floor windows and doors on all the buildings.

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The company asked Ofgem to approve the project, under a condition that, by the end of , there would be MW of generation capacity on Orkney committed to use the link once it is built.However, Ofgem has made its approval subject to SSEN demonstrating that, by no later than December , at least MW of new generation on Orkney has either been awarded a Contract for Dferencein the government#s  CfD auction or has secured planning consent and finance to construct its project.Meeting this increased generation target could prove challenging. This summer saw planning applications two large-scale wind farms, which would have contributed to this generation total, refused by Orkney Islands Council#s planning committee, following signicant public opposition.SSEN has said it #strongly disagrees# with MW of new generation being required, saying their figure of MW is based on industry best practice, which has been used to assess similar transmission investments across GB. SSEN has also said it is unclear why Ofgem is proposing a dferent test for Orkney, which it says conflicts with Ofgem’s own guidance on these types of transmission investments.Ofgem also says it plans to reduce the cost to consumers of building the link by seeking to replicate the outcomes of competition by using the #Competition Proxy# model, where it will set the revenue that SSEN can earn from building and operating the Orkney link based on its experience in cutting the costs of connecting offshore wind farms to the grid by tendering the ownership of these links.SSEN has stated concerns that the Competition Proxy model has  still not been fully developed by Ofgem, rather than the well-established Strategic Wider Works model.Ofgem has said it will make a decision on the business case for the link in spring next year and will confirm whether it will use the Competition Proxy model at the same time.Speaking on Friday, following the publication of Ofgem#s Needs Case consultation publication, David Gardner, SSEN#s director of transmission, said the recognition that the connection is needed is #a crucial step forward#, adding: “Whilst there are still several obstacles to overcome, having got this far it is important we don’t miss this opportunity to unlock Orkney’s vast renewables potential.#We will therefore continue to work in close consultation with our generation customers and wider stakeholders to address the key points raised by Ofgem in its consultation.”Ofgem has separately published a consultation on SSEN’s #Alternative Approach for Orkney# policy proposal, designed to overcome the barriers to connection faced by SSEN’s generation customers on Orkney.Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur welcomed Ofgem#s consultation but said there is still work to do to ensure SSEN#s proposals meet the needs and reflect the concerns of the local community.Aside from a transmission subsea cable from Orkney to Caithness, SSEN#s transmission reinforcement project, which, in one form or another, would stretch around most of the Orkney mainland and some of the south isles, would consist of:More information on SSEN#s Orkney Transmission Reinforcement project can be found at company#s website, here.For more on this story, see next Thursday#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The first £ payment will be made around the time a child starts nursery, to help with the costs of early learning and a further £ when they start school.Social security secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “I am delighted we will be delivering the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment earlier than originally planned, providing low income families with increased financial support. I am particularly pleased, that by not capping children, babies born in the last six months who already have a big brother or sister, and had no support from the UK Government because they were not the first child, will be eligible to get their payment.“With the Early Learning and School Age Payments, this means that for a two child family, the Best Start Grant will provide £, # £, more than they would get under the UK legacy benefit.

The appeal ends at the end of the year.Donations forms have been published in The Orcadian over the appeal, with donations also accepted online at: www.gofundme longhope-leboat-museumThe trust can also be contacted via email: longhope@gmailcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The city’s renowned Festival and Fringe, Hogmanay celebration and other events have also proved to be a powerful attraction.Edinburgh now attracts nearly four million visitors a year and, collectively, they spend an impressive £. billion, supporting the jobs of some , people.However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing and many in the city have come to the conclusion that tourism has now reached that point to the dismay of Gordon Robertson, the chair of Marketing Edinburgh. He told how “everybody hates a tourist” seemed to have become the city’s strapline as people increasingly subscribe to the “tourism bad narrative”.And Robertson is right to raise the alarm over this trend. Scotland’s economy needs all the help it can get and catering for tourists is now an important part of this country’s financial well-being. The only way Scotland is going to tackle poverty, spend more on the NHS and create the kind of country that everyone wants to see is to grow the economy.: Stephen Jardine: Hoaching Edinburgh needs a tourist taxThat said, Robertson perhaps might agree that, in hindsight, his remark that he was “not so sure Disneyfication is a bad thing”, after his family went on a trip to the cartoon-inspired resort, might be a bit of a gt to his opponents.He may have meant Disney’s “well-trained staff” and “fantastic experience”, he may have said “none of us wants to live in a theme park”, but critics who already complain about the Disneyfication of Edinburgh will simply see this as further evidence of their claims.One reason tourists love Edinburgh is its stunning urban landscape: the castle on a hill, Arthur’s Seat, the tangible, living history of the Old and New Towns. There is a place for See-you-Jimmy hat shops, but too many would detract from that.So Edinburgh needs to strike a balance between pleasing tourists and remaining a city where people live and work.

It was the sort of note that any polite person – you or I for example – might have been expected to write in the circumstances,But these are strange times and Bush’s letter was held up as the work of a great statesman. With Donald Trump now in the White House, a US president behaving as anything other than a lout seemed quite astonishing.I must admit to having indulged in my own bit of revisionism when George W Bush delivered the eulogy at his father’s funeral. Never an admirer of Dubya, I listened to him speak to a congregation which included Trump, and thought “well, I’d have that guy back in an instant”. In power, Bush Jr might have represented a politics with which I had little sympathy but, well, at least he wasn’t like the current guy.I had similar feelings last week when Prime Minister Theresa May faced a motion of no confidence from hardline Eurosceptics – the new generation of what a former PM described as his party’s “bastards” – determined to bring her down and replace her with someone devoted to their cause.May is, by some margin, the worst prime minister in living memory. She’s a poor communicator, a terrible strategist, and – policy-wise – has frequently displayed the sort of “nasty party” colours she once warned colleagues against showing.But at least she wasn’t one of the other guys. At least she wasn’t Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg or David Davis or any of the other charlatans in the Tory party who want the hardest possible Brexit, regardless of the damage – economic and constitutional – that such circumstances might wreak upon the United Kingdom. I’m fairly confident this was the thinking behind the decisions of at least some of those Tory MPs who rallied around her in the face of a Eurosceptic onslaught. May might not be perfect but, boy, look at the alternatives.This was not, of course, the first time that May had benefited from not being the other guy. In , when she stood to replace David Cameron, May’s campaign was greatly assisted by her not being Andrea Leadsom, who reckoned the fact she was – unlike her opponent – a mother gave her the edge in the contest.And so May lives to fight on – at least for a yearshe wishes, given that Tory Party rules prohibit another leadership challenge for  months – in part not because she is especially good at her job but because she is better than the alternatives.And she truly is, isn’t she Take one of her tormentors-in-chief, David Davis, for example. Davis appeared on Question Time on Thursday and calmly spoke utter rubbish in defence of his position that a dferent leader would have secured a better deal from the EU. This delusion – or lie, depending on your stomach for this nonsense – infects the Tory right. The EU would give much more groundonly the Prime Minister was tougher in negotiations. Forget the indisputable fact that the EU’s responsibility is to those states that wish to remain members, they’d roll over and do our biddingonly we believed.Fending off a question about the possibility of a second referendum as a potential way of moving things forward, Davis warned that after such a vote – which Leave would again win – the EU would give the UK a worse deal than the one, the final one, mark you, currently on the table.Thus Davis’s position is that the EU would give the UK a better deal nowonly the Prime Minister were more forceful, but it would give us a worse one after a second referendum.Plausible and matey – in a Lexus-driver-at-the-th-hole kind of way – Davis puts forward a version of reality that makes no sense whatsoever. European leaders have made it perfectly clear that they wish the UK was not leaving the EU and they have been equally explicit about the fact the deal currently on offer is the best – and only one – available.Yet Davis – a failure as Brexit secretary, let’s not forget – blithely repeats the myth that a tougher PM could have extracted more concessions from those continental sorts. Before he took the coward’s way out and quit his cabinet position, Davis failed to extract these concessions, of course. But that wasn’t his fault, it was the PM’s.With grubby little men like Davis and Rees-Mogg circling May, is it any wonder she survives, in part, because at least she’s a better option than them Labour, too, is held back by the fact that at least May isn’t Jeremy Corbyn. In normal – or what used to pass for normal – circumstances, a government as chaotic as May’s would be trailing the opposition. Corbyn should be on course to certain electoral victory.Instead, Labour remains stubbornly behind the Conservative Party in opinion poll after opinion poll. The Prime Minister may be dreadful but the alternative offered by the cult of Corbyn seems so much worse.And so May retains power, power which she is currently using to direct herself towards parliamentary rejection of the draft departure agreement struck with EU leaders. There can be no more concessions from Europe and there will be no second referendum to try to move this miserable process forward, she insists.I wonder, however, whether that position will hold. The Prime Minister might continue to reject a so-called “People’s Vote” but perhaps the time will come when she realises, in these days where the best option is the least bad one, that would be preferable to the No Deal Brexit so many of her colleagues would be happy to inflict on the United Kingdom.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4844668.1544898647!/image/image.jpg","title":"library snaps up rare sylvia plath poem first published by scottish printer","story":"She is the American writer widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of the th century.He is a little-known Scottish publisher who worked with a private printing press for more than half a century.Now the role played by Alan Anderson, a banker turned bookseller, in helping to get Slyvia Plath’s career off the ground is finally being recognised.The National Library of Scotland has acquired the first work Plath had published in her own right – thanks to an offer of help from Anderson.Just  copies of a four-page pamphlet featuring Plath’s poem, A Winter Ship, were made at his workshop in Edinburgh at her request in .It is thought the writer sent the poem to family and friends inside Christmas cards. It was said to have been inspired by the waterfront in her native Boston, where she and husband Ted Hughes were living when she wrote the poem.The couple had moved to London by the time her pamphlet was published in  by Anderson’s one-man Tragara Press outfit, after Plath had been impressed by proofs he had sent her.Anderson ended up publishing Plath’s poem after initially writing to Hughes to express his admiration about his work.After being sent samples showing how the poem would appear in print, Plath wrote to Anderson, telling him: “I am writing on my own behalf to say how delighted my husband and I were with the proofs of A Winter Ship. I’m sending back the one we like best, with the border round it. “We thought we’d like the date, place and press in upright letters, as on the other proof, and my name deleted – as I’ll write that on the inside myself, with Christmas greetings too.”The National Library hopes the acquisition of the poem will raise greater awareness of Anderson, who was still operating his printing press at his home in the Highlands shortly before he died in  at the age of .Born in Fe in , he started his working le as a banker and took up a post with an antiquarian bookseller in Edinburgh after serving in the Royal Navy, before buying his own bookshop.Anderson would go on to publish an anthology of work by Barry Humphries, the Australian writer and actor best known for creating the character Dame Edna Everage.Graham Hogg, rare books curator at the National Library, said: “Alan Anderson had a private press so he just did what he wanted and when he wanted. He wasn’t actively going out and touting for work. He was never in it for the money – it was a hobby and a passion for him.“Alan Anderson mostly published small pamphlets for contemporary poets that he was interested in. He only really printed work that he liked or work for friends.“This particular one came about when he wrote to Ted Hughes to say how impressed he was by a short story he had written and askedhe had anything  and would be happy to print it. Ted Hughes wrote back to him and said that his we was writing poetry and askedhe could publish something. I doubt any money would have changed hands at all. They were never intended for public sale. “It’s very much a curio as she actually sent them out in their Christmas cards. He had sent her two proof copies and she chose the one she liked.”Born in Boston in , Plath met Hughes in  when she was studying at Cambridge University and they married a few months later. However, they had a tempestuous relationship and after Hughes met another woman in  he split with Plath, who had been troubled with mental illness for years.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country.

Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England. A separation you are keen to expand upon. I have to say you do seem confusedSo your British now,not a Shetlander, # accepting the majority wanting to be part of the E.U, So much for Wir Shetlandits Wir Westminster then!Fake news strikes again then I guess#Which is this culture that demands you submit without question Ali   Sounds like it owes more to Henry Tudor than Kant and Rousseau. And what culture is it you are being asked to accept that separates us and is abhorrent to you   Eurovision   Persian   Mesophilic Perhaps you can expand on what your gripe actually is Ali,it isn’t pulling sovereignty with folk little dferent from ourselves.FYI should Brexiteers triumph I’d still rather separate Scotland from England and stay European as I don’t much want to be led by English nationalist bigots. No confusion there.As I said only a fool submits without question, and remaining in the eu is submitting without question.Go read the Lisbon treatyyou think it isn#t.I am intrigued as to what other opinions there is on Brexit, and whether or not this has a political agenda to suit the purpose for a particular party to benefit Is Brexit for the greater good of the few, but at the cost to the many Would Shetland be better off under Brexit   There does not appear to be a definite picture being drawn where people can make a concise and definitive choice. Even the politics which has caused this mess, seem to be at odds with each other  How do they expect the people of the countryto choose   The more you look into Brexit, the more I am convinced we would be better off on our own Maybe we should re-establish our links back to Denmark     .."},{"url":null,"title":"college board supports college merger ","story":"Plans to merge tertiary education, research and training in the isles have been backed by the SIC#s college board.A full business case was put before councillors at a meeting this morning, with chairman Peter Campbell saying #this is a meeting that is clearly the most signicant meeting the college board has ever held#.Councillors backed a recommendation that brings together Shetland College, the NAFC Marine Centre and Train Shetland as a new college under the University of Highlands and Islands.It is being discussed at meeting throughout the week, going before the full council on Wednesday.The move, according to the business case would save about £. million over a five-year period “streamlining and maximising the efficiency of the college structure and curriculum, whilst improving outcomes delivered for students and staff”.However, Shetland South councillor George Smith had concerns about the curriculum in future, as well as how a reduction in staff and a push for more income in the plan would work. raquoAs an early Principal of NAFC, and also a Head of Department, Depute Principal and Principal of a Scottish Funding Council funded college offering fisheries and marine education, I would urge Board Members to be extremely cautious regarding the proposed merger.Unless it has changed considerably in the few years since I retired the SFC funding formula strongly mitigates against courses in maritime and engineering related subjects.The funding offered goes nowhere near meeting operational expenditure as it is based on head count with smaller classes being the norm due to the nature of the industry and health and safety considerations.We could only maintain our curriculum at Banff and Buchan due to industry contributions and offering a range of courses where we knew we could attract large numbers to balance the losses on maritime and engineering.The other factor is the large associated capital spend for marine simulation and engineering equipment.With news where of a bumper year for NAFC, be careful not to throw out the baby with the bathwater..."},{"url":null,"title":"norovirus forces two day closure of dunrossness primary ","story":"Dunrossness Primary School imposed a -hour closure on Thursday after an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug, Norovirus.School officials say the decision to remain shut until Monday follows unfortunate incidents in which both pupils and staff were struck ill by the virus.Director of the council#s children#s services, Helen Budge, said that the decision was made to keep the bug contained.Moves will also be made to clean the school and the time off will also give those affected time to recover.#The decision was taken, and I absolutely think it is the right decision,# she said.#It got to the stage that the number of staff being off meant it was going to make it very dficult to cover everything.#.."},{"url":null,"title":"admin assistant at cope ","story":"We are looking to recruit an enthusiastic person to join our dynamic social enterprise to work in our Finance and Admin team.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"skye prepares for santa dash","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA record high number of runners have signed up for the third annual Skye Santa Dash taking place in Portree this Saturday .More than  people have signed up for the festive frolic which starts from Somerled Square in Portree and is organised by Skye Events.In , a erse field of participants including adults, children, and animals embraced the festive spirit and adorned the famous Santa suit to undertake the two-mile charitable run.Although the event organisers will be keen to see white beards swishing and red hats bobbing come Saturday, this year they have added a few twists to the proceedings to make the dash even more inclusive and environmentally friendly. Firstly, in a bid to reduce ‘fast fashion’ a fancy-dress option will be available to participants with the focus on homemade outfits. And in a bid to encourage participation and make the event less competitive, prizes on the day will be only awarded to the best-dressed participants. These include chocolates, Isle of Skye Whisky and sides of salmon donated by the Scottish Salmon Company.A route for participants who have impaired mobility will also be incorporated into this year’s race. This follows on from a link-up between the event organisers and Amanda Bell from the West Highland College, who runs a fitness group for restricted mobility participants. This includes parents with pushchairs, children who cannot manage the whole route and entrants who have mobility limitations.Event organisers have said that the sections that are alternatives to the main route, will not be marshalled, so caution will need to be exercised when crossing roads.All proceeds from the participants taking part in the main route will go towards the Rotary Club of the Isle of Skye, while proceeds from the alternative route entrants will go towards the West Highland College restricted mobility fitness course.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The government must stop dragging its heels and implement this motion,\" she said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27504  ","story":"Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald and Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson pictured at the Politico Awards in Brussels last night.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8737398.1544617405!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian paisley luxury maldives holiday paid for by mystery friend","story":"The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.Ian Paisley, M.P.The holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of membersrsquo interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.ldquoFor the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you.

AndEamonn Higgins of Hot Milk Forge has his way, the skills of yesteryear will be passed down to future generations - thanks in part to global TV hit ‘Game of Thrones’ with its sword and sorcery primetime magic. Hot Milk Forge is a Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing School based on the Lisnamanny Road in Ballymena.It runs evening, weekend and day classes in Basic to Advanced Artist Blacksmithing and Bladesmithing and people have been travelling to the courses from all over the world.Speaking to the Ballymena , Eamonn said he loves teaching his craft to keen and intrigued novices.I have been a professional artist and sculptor since .For  years Blacksmithing has formed an integral part of my practice with public works scattered across the UK and commercial works collected internationally, Eamonn explained.However I love taking the courses and teaching people a new skill, something they wouldnt ever experience.The -year-old said he recently had a lady travel all the way from Kerry to make her own unique creations.This woman drove a long way to do the course and she made a number of intricate brooches and pieces of art that she can treasure.I have many people that sign up to the course who are big fans of Game of Thrones and TV shows like that but a lot of people just want to try something dferent, Eamonn said.At the minute we are making mostly knives which seems to be the trendy item at the minute.“This has probably come from the huge interest in Game of Thrones.”Eamonn has been approached by the HBO series to make specic items for the show and has had many of the actors who appeared on the show taking his courses.Hot Milk Forge offers evening and Weekend Classes in Blacksmithing with an artistic twist. Evening classes are open to everyone above the age of . Participants are encouraged to learn the traditional skills not just because the celebration of wrought iron work is a worthy idea but also because only blacksmithing can introduce you to the full potential of steel as a creative medium. At the forge they weld with a fire and not with electricity. Imagine making your own fire side set, wrought iron gate, gts for your partner, sculpture, the list goes on.FAMILY FARMHot Milk Forge is located on Eamonns family farm and the workshop is where the first milking parlour was located many moons ago. His childhood years growing up surrounded by natural beauty of the nearby Antrim Hills continue to influence his work which often looks primeval, resembling the misshapen bodies of humans and animals miraculously preserved in Irish bogs for thousands of years. I try to give my work a certain austerity, a terrible beauty that is timeless and that can be associated with Irish art through the millennia. “As I come from a rural background, the landscape and its people speak more to me than some of the more conceptual art in vogue. “As a child I grew up playing in mud in haystacks and running about the fields. “I absorbed all of this subconsciously and it comes out in my work.”Eamonn has been demonstrating and teaching blacksmithing as part of his Public Art practice as long as he has been blacksmithing.In  on completion of a two year artist residency in the University of Ulster Eamonn decided it was time his blacksmithing classes had a permanent home Hot Milk Forge was born.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list. Rea also finished runner up in the  BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

I went travelling the world racing bikes.“After I left school I went to technical college and got an HNC in manufacturing engineering and then went on to work as an engineer.“It was hard to hold down a job as I was taking too much time off work to go racing.“I had what was nearly a career-ending injury. That was a dark time in my le because I didn’t know what was coming, I’d no great qualications behind me, I was working a minimum wage job. I wasn’t in a great state of mind.“I threw myself at bikes for a few years and then it worked out, my big break came.”He added: “Northern Ireland fans are very important to me. The travelling support has been immense these last few years. It just keeps getting bigger and bigger.“On my sighting laps and slow down laps I can see the Northern Ireland fans. I always try to throw out a leg to acknowledge I’ve seen them.”Rea is often claimed by both Larne and Ballyclare and sometimes referred to as a son of Ballymena. Asked where he came from, he said: “I’m a country boy. I grew up in Kilwaughter, then moved to Ballyboley. We were part of Larne Council with a Ballymena area code and a Ballyclare postcode.

Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

For after much soul searching and deliberating, Christina has decided to take her love for her community on to the next level by becoming a Sinn Féin City Hall rep. Christina has been co-opted on to Belfast City Council in place of the outgoing Councillor Mary McConville, who has stepped down for health reasons.“I’ve been involved in community work for twenty-three years now. One of my earliest memories is of me at five years old walking down the Grosvenor holding a sign that said, ‘We want heat not cold feet’ – my mummy had me involved in community work from no age, it’s in my blood,” Christina told the Andersonstown News, smiling at the memory.“I attended my first Belfast City Council meeting at the beginning of December. I was a bit nervous speaking, but I got through it. It was very interesting watching the dynamics of the Council.”Christina identied some of the issues that pushed her over the line when it came to making the decision to enter City Hall.“There are local issues that I want to make an impact on. I have given this a lot of thought and I discussed it with my husband before I made my decision, we both agreed that it’s the right path for me, I feel that it is a natural progression.“I want to make a dference and I want to carry on the good work of Mary McConville. I live in this area so I am well aware of the local issues and I find them as much a challenge as everyone .“I believe you should feel safe in your area, you should feel happy, you should benefit from generated investment. There are huge developments happening in the city centre, these should be impacting the areas around it to a greater extent, and I feel I can represent people fully in that respect.”Christina’s much-missed mother Belle was a renowned voluntary community worker –chairperson of the Roden Street Development Group at Grosvenor Community Centre.“My mother taught me that community is everything, she also taught me that a community worker is never off duty. She never feared going the extra mile to ensure that people got what they deserved.“I have been described as being parochial, which I don’t think is true, I am very open minded in my thinking. But I would agree I am there to represent local voters, so to a certain extent I must be parochial to genuinely bring that local voice forward.”Christina continued: “I’m the kind of person who works hard, but my mother, well, she worked tirelessly.Her door never stopped, people always turned to her.She gave everything andI can be half the woman she was I will be happy. I’m going to have to learn to manage my work-le balance, though.“Since my mummy passed away I have tried to continue her good work, she showed me the ropes and I think she would be delighted to see me take on this role. At the end of the day I work for this community and I promise to do all I can to ensure the people get what they are entitled to.“There’s a gap between the Grosvenor Road and the city centre that is crying out for investment. The Belfast Transport Hub is going in, which I believe will generate employment. I would love for our young people to be in a position to become engineers and the like. I would love to find a way to get them that training to elevate them to those amazing employment opportunities.“I really want better for our people, I am so proud of being from Roden Street and I will never leave the Grosvenor Community Centre, it’s been too many people’s le’s work. I want to do my Council work to the best of my abilities in my own time.“I’m going to try my hardest to do the best job possible for the people of this area and beyond.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new report lays out bright future for west belfast","story":"A NEW report detailing the positive transformation that has taken place in West Belfast in recent years will be launched on tomorrow morning . ‘Vision : Transforming West Belfast’ will look to the future as well as outlining projects such as the James Connolly Interpretive Centre, Casement Park and the Roddy McCorley Society interactive museum and visitor centre.The report has been commissioned by Fáilte Feirste Thiar and the West Belfast Partnership Board and will highlight the amount of investment that has gone into the West of the city.Projects in the spotlight in the report include:•£m from Belfast City Council for the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre•m from the Department for Communities and Ciste for Áras na BhFál• £m for the Balmoral Hotel•£.m for the Blackmountain Shared Space Project•£m investment for Brook Leisure Centre•£m for the Falls Park City Cemetery MasterplanIn total, the report will list  projects in West Belfast that have benefited from investment.Speaking to the Andersonstown News ahead of the launch, Harry Connolly, Executive Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, said: “In recent years West Belfast has began to secure increased amounts of public sector investment.“Research undertaken for this publication has uncovered that this combined investment totals over £ million – a signicant figure.“Many people involved in our local private, public and community sectors will not be fully aware of the huge amount of work involved nor the scale of the investment secured.

He’s now been issued with a summons and was due to appear in court on Wednesday morning – but the hearing was adjourned for the second time.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, a gobsmacked Seamus said: “I’ve kept horses all my le, they are beautul creatures. I am in poor health and looking after these horses brings me a real sense of joy.”Seamus lives with COPD, is diabetic and has suffered multiple heart attacks.He continued: “I was giving bread to the horses, minding my own business, and these two characters approached me and demanded I stopped. This field belongs to my friend and I have permission to feed these horses. What harm was I doing  I don’t need the stress and strain of this.”Seamus described the encounter that led to the series of events that has left him baffled and angry.“I pulled my car up that morning and walked over to feed the horses, these two fellas shouted over at me and told me to stop. I told them to take themselves off, they said they were ringing the peelers and I told them to get whoever they wanted. One of the men said the birds were lting the bread I was feeding the horses and dropping it in his garden, absolute nonsense. I got into my car and drove off. Your man must have taken my car registration because I received a fixed penalty notice in the post.”Seamus added: “I turned up to court on the arranged date and the complainant never bothered turning up. I showed up again on Tuesday and the same thing, he never weighed in again. NowI didn’t bother turning up I’m sure they’d have something to say about that. This is a complete and utter waste of Belfast City Council time and money and I am urging them to drop it.”Local People Before Profit Councillor Matt Collins said: “This whole situation is ridiculous, whoever made the decision to issue a court summons to Seamus perhaps needs a basic crash course in what constitutes illegal or criminal behaviour. This summons should be withdrawn and Belfast City Council should apologise to Seamus immediately.“It’s also worth saying that Seamus is taking this in his stride and isn’t backing down – and fair play to him for that. But other people would likely be intimidated by this. Nobody wants brought up in front of a court and especially for something so absurd. I’d imagine the vast majority of people would agree with me that Belfast City Council and the powers-that-be in this city ought to put their time and energy into something more productive, instead of hauling a pensioner up in front of a court for feeding horses.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Council said that as this is an ongoing matter they would not be making any comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the fureys uniting generations through music","story":"DESPITE its relatively small population, ours has never been a country with a shortage of musicians on the international stage, but few of them have had an impact as lasting as The Fureys.Formed in the , the iconic folk group has entertained audiences throughout the world for  years. While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

It involved physical mapping of the Border by army personnel along with desk-top work and was completed in recent months.Defence Forces are in continual mapping of Irelands Border for security purposes, such as during the Foot  Mouth disease outbreak  years ago The latest exercise is regarded as particularly signicant in light of the potential security risks posed by Brexit.The updated map of the frontier will form a key part of the security services contingency planning for a doomsday scenario that could follow Britain plunging out of the EU without a deal.The last official report on the Border identied  official crossing points. That report was published jointly in July by the Department of Transport, Tourism  Sport and the Department of Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.However, it highlighted only public roadways along the Border that stretches from Donegal to Antrim and did not include any private roads or laneways.The Defence Forces work has highlighted scores of private crossing points, some of which could be vulnerable to criminality in the event of a hard border. The Irish Armys Border mapping work can be viewed in the context of the security risks posed by Brexit, which were outlined in stark detail at a cross-border crime conference last month.Garda Commissioner Drew Harris told the conference that dissidents would \"undoubtedly\" attempt to exploit a hard border as \"something they wish to rally around\".\" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks \" width\"\" \"\"  The Irish border which has proven a thorny issue in Brexit talks But the conference was also warned that even a soft Brexit could lead to challenges with increases in cross-border smuggling of all kinds, including people trafficking, cigarette and alcohol smuggling and fuel laundering. The conference was told that pc of cross-border gangs are highly mobile and operate on both sides of the Border.Previous security assessments have identied  criminal gangs dominating cigarette smuggling on both sides of the Border. The Governments position is that there must be noto a hard border.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said earlier this month that the Government has no contingency plans in place for policing the Border in the event of a hard Brexit.However, he said the Government does \"have regard for the fact that we could see an increase in smuggling and other illegal cross-border activities\".In a statement to the Sunday Independent, the Defence Forces said: \"In the normal course, Oglaigh na hEireann carry out analysis and background research into contingencies. This would include viable border crossings. In the context of security, any research in relation to the border or otherwise is internal to Oglaigh na hEireann.\"A statement from An Garda Siochana this weekend said they \"have been and will continue to review the policing issues relating to Brexit. This has included regular liaison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland. However, without a final political settlement, it is not yet clear what the specic impacts on policing will be.\"\"Regardless of the final political settlement, our long-standing strong working relationship with the PSNI will continue in order to protect and support communities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"may promises further talks with eu to get assurances on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They are contained in the conclusions of yesterday evening.“That is our position. That is what we have put on the table. And now we expect Great Britain to respond.”Belgium’s PM Charles Michel said: “The ball is now politically in the British court.”And Mr Tusk said he had “no mandate” to organise any further negotiations.Mrs May’s hopes of a legally binding commitment on the backstop from the EU were dashed on Thursday, when Mr Juncker said there could be “no real changes” to the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated over  months.It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.— Keir StarmerDecember , The Prime Minister addressed the EU leaders on Thursday about MPs’ concerns  about the backstop which had prevented her getting her Brexit deal through Parliament this week.Mr Tusk said the leaders had expressed a “firm determination” to work “speedily” to ensure there is an agreement on the future relationship in place by the time the transition period ends in December , so the backstop is not needed.But Mr Juncker criticised Britain’s lack of clarity over what it was seeking from the future relationship.“Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want,” he said.“So we would like, within a few weeks, our UK friends to set out their expectations for us because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarications.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker embraces council president Donald Tusk at the Brussels summit The EU hardball approach appears to leave Mrs May with limited room for manoeuvre during the countdown to the UK’s departure on March .The Prime Minister told the summit that a package of assurances around the backstop could “change the dynamic” at Westminster.At the same time, she made clear a failure by EU leaders to offer concessions risked the collapse of the whole agreement, with the UK leaving in March in a disorderly, no-deal Brexit.Mrs May managed a smile at her press conference when a reporter askedshe had had a “trying week”, jokingly replying: “Has something happened this week ”When asked whether the problems with her party at home and dealing with the EU had made her want to quit as leader, she said it is “our duty as a Government and as a Parliament” to see Brexit through.WATCH LIVE: PM @Theresa_May holds a press conference following EU Council https:t.co irtqNcSv— UK Prime MinisterDecember , She added: “I never said it was going to be easy.“Negotiations like this are always tough.

Mrs Hoey has campaigned strongly for Brexit, despite her constituency voting overwhelmingly to Remain in the EU.The Labour MP was heavily criticised in February when she said that the Good Friday Agreement was \"unsustainable\".Speaking at the Leave Means Leave rally Mrs Hoey said she was \"very proud to be pro-union\".\"We didnt spend  years in Northern Ireland stopping IRA terrorists killing soldiers, police, and civilians, in order to get a United Ireland to allow a few jumped-up EU bureaucrats and a complicit prime minister to try and do the same thing by the back door,\" she said.\"Even more ridiculous is that it would not even be in the economic interests of Northern Ireland who depend so much of their trade, to and from Britain.

We have become an irrelevancy. Because there are that many MPs against it we might as well sit at home,\" Mr Wilson said.Former UKIP boss Nigel Farage told the rally that he felt a second referendum was now inevitable and urged people to vote Leave in even greater numbers so there could be no doubting the will of the UK to leave the EU.

access as well as better verication of identity to improve the security and accuracy of the electoral roll are among measures outlined for public consultation.Members of the public can have their say until March.Minister for Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan said: “These changes,implemented, would be the most signicant reform of the electoral registration process since .“As well as removing an excessive number of steps involved in applying to be included on the electoral register, the proposals would further increase the register’s ability to keep up to date with changing inidual circumstances and, therefore its integrity.”These changes reflect changes in how we live todayJohn Paul PhelanFacebookTwitterHe said reducing the number of dferent forms, allowing people to register online and introducing a process of continuous or rolling registration would make the process much more user-friendly and similar to the way people interact with other State services.He added: “These changes reflect changes in how we live today.“Having a registration process that recognises and facilitates more frequent changes of address is crucial in maintaining an accurate register.”The proposals include:– A more streamlined, simplied electoral registration process, with a single, simplied form.– Rolling, or continuous registration – rather than the current draft, live and supplement versions of the register – this will provide for a single, live register at all times.– The introduction of online registration as an optional alternative to paper-based registration – currently people must complete paper application forms and send them to their local authority.– Inidual registration only – currently the use of household forms could potentially result in people being included on the register or their registration details being amended without their explicit consent.– The establishment of a single, national electoral register database to be used by all local authorities to standardise data formats and processes help prevent and remove duplicate entries and ensure standardised data protection and management procedures.– Improvements to the system of identity verication to streamline the system by minimising the need to present documentation to a local Garda station and minimise the potential for duplicate entries or erroneous amendments.– The possibility of data sharing between public bodies and electoral registration authorities to maintain details."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove and ed balls filmed dancing gangnam style at christmas party","story":" Hi

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

nationalist outlook into a much broader socialist movement, mourners said.The former Workers Party president died from cancer on Thursday aged .Dozens of people gathered outside a social club off the Falls Road in West Belfast to pay their respects as his remains arrived for a wake.His Belfast-born widow Mary received the hugs and sympathy of well-wishers.Daughter Caoimhe was also present as the wicker coffin was wheeled from the hearse without ceremony, flowers or flags into a social club close to the Royal Victoria Hospital.Mr Garland took part in the IRAs border campaign in the s but after the cessation of violence was a leading proponent of the socialism which split the organisation and led to the rise of the Provisionals.A Workers Party spokesman, who did not want to be named, said: \"He was one of the people in the s who had completely re-thought and transformed the concept of what it was to be republican and moved that away from a very narrow, nationalist perspective, into a much broader political socialist, Marxist, communist analysis of society.\"He said himself many times that we have seen the consequence of what the narrow nationalism meant in subsequent years after that.\"He was involved in an attack on the Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Brookeborough in Co Fermanagh on January  , which led to the deaths of fellow IRA members Sean South and Fergal OHanlon, an event marked by song and lore in republican circles.Mr Garland was part of a group of senior republicans, including Cathal Goulding and Tomas Mac Giolla, influenced by internationalist communism during the s.The spokesman added: \"One of his quotes from that period subsequently has been that he realised that people like him were sitting in backrooms in conspiracies while working-class people were out on the streets, demanding change and improvements in their material conditions and it is possible that republicans were orced from that reality.\"Throughout the violence of the s and s, the Workers Party promoted dialogue about peaceful co-existence in Northern Ireland.The Official IRA split with the Belfast-led Provisionals in .

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Thinking about the design, I wanted something that symbolised security and protection, and also represented something my neighbours and I had in common. “So I thought of my dear old Alsatian, Clint, who used to guard our house when I was a kid. “Our neighbours were very fond of him, and used to help feed him, so I thought guard dogs would be the perfect theme. “I drew the gates in a Celtic style, with the elongated, elegant dogs’ bodies and sinuous lines of the tails also reflecting some of the style of Art Nouveau.This sculpture is called Master McGrath falls into the frozen River AltJonny works as Arts Assistant for Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon Borough Council, based at Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, in the beautul, historic location of Moneypenny’s Lock, on the Newry Canal outside Portadown. He reminisced: “When work had finished for the day, I would start work on my gates after hours. “Most of the gates are hand forged in the traditional manner, heating the steel in the forge then shaping it on the anvil, as it has been done for thousands of years. Mayor wishes all a very Merry Christmas Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“The decorative finials , drop bolts, and most of the dogs’ swirling, interlaced bodies are forged this way. For the heads and lower legs, I used more modern techniques such as plasma cutting and grinding to shape the steel. “Then I joined everything together with the MiG welder. To accentuate the eyes, and the dog collars, I added some brass. One of the last details I added was the traditional latch, which is decorated with two matching hand-forged Celtic trisceles representing the dogs’ hearts.”Jonny first started blacksmithing at Tannaghmore Gardens Animal Farm and then at Moneypenny’s since . “As a member of Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop, I have had the great privilege of learning from two of the best artist-blacksmiths in the country, Steve Murphy and Aaron Leach. “You can see some of the workshop’s work at Tannaghmore Animal Farm, where we made the entrance gates. We also made the sculptures within the Master McGrath Maze at Tannaghmore. “My piece in the maze – ‘Master McGrath Falling into the Frozen River’ is in a similar style to the ‘Guard Dog Gates’.”Jonny has always had an interest in sculpture since his Art College days in the late s.“I started off carving wood, then, inspired by seeing the Brancusi Museum in Paris, started to carve in stone. In  -  I carved the ‘Human Sundial’ at Oxford Island. “My lelong love of Nature has always inspired my work. Long walks in the country supply both materials and subject matter for my work, which features owls, herons, bulls, cats, dogs etc. “The joy I find in Nature, and in immersing myself in materials from granite and marble to oak and ash, all the way to steel, copper and brass, I try to communicate to the viewer, and to students,” he said.“In recent years, as well as blacksmithing, I have also been teaching Stone Carving in local centres, particularly letter carving. “If you are interested in trying blacksmithing, you can contact Moneypenny’s Blacksmith Workshop on Facebook, or call  .“If you would like to try letter carving in stone, look out for upcoming classes at community centres near you.”If you want to see the gates being made, you can see the whole process on YouTube just search for ‘Stomp Box Jonny guard dog gates’.try catch  TrendingDad leaves sickbed to deliver baby in laybyFatal car crash victim, , is namedRoad closed due to crashPolice angered as thieves target elderly woman in supermarketMumrsquos shock as schoolgirl knocked down in lsquohit and runrsquo incident          ..

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province.

Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
