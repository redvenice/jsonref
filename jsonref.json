Just days into her campaign for the Orlando-based House seat, Jackson has already garnered endorsements from two powerful civil rights champions: attorney Benjamin Crump and Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother. In recent years, Jackson has collaborated with Crump on some of the nation’s most high-profile police violence cases, representing the families of Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, according to Florida Politics. “What we saw with George Floyd, we saw his family get justice in court. But that five minutes of justice didn’t address the entire criminal justice system, nor did it address the economic inequality in Orange county,” Jackson said. “We need to bring about that type of change. So I feel I can be best suited in the legislature to do that.” The decision will almost certainly be a topic of discussion between Biden and Putin when the two leaders meet in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June.Asked for his message to Republicans who are opposing the bill to establish a bipartisan commission to study the Capitol insurrection, Biden told them, “Eat some chocolate, chocolate chip.” Elaborating a bit more, Biden added, “I can’t imagine anyone voting against establishing a commission on the greatest assault since the civil war on the Capitol. But at any rate, I came for ice cream.” The president purchased a scoop of ice cream in a waffle cone, and he posed for a photo with one of the Honey Hut employees. The list identifies Republican lawmakers who have touted the benefits of the American Rescue Plan after they unanimously voted against the bill in Congress. Senator Roger Wicker, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy and House Republican conference chair Elise Stefanik are a few of the names on the list, the picture shows. “We must restore the connection between the success of our economy and the people who produce that success, hardworking Americans,” Biden said. “That connection has been severed.” The president argued that rising wages should be a feature, not a bug, of a strong economy. He also pledged that he would judge the success of his economic policy based on how working Americans are faring. “We started seeing the stock market and corporate profits and executive pay as the sole measure of our economic success,” Biden said. “Let me tell you something — my sole measure of economic success is how working families are doing.”  Biden also reiterated his call for Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, a proposal that was stripped out of his coronavirus relief package. “No one should work 40 hours a week and live in poverty,” Biden said. The president’s remarks in Cleveland have now concluded, and he will soon start his journey back to Washington.The president criticized Republicans for approving the 2017 tax cuts that disproportionately benefitted the wealthiest Americans. Biden has proposed rolling back those tax cuts to pay for an infrastructure package, but Republicans are adamantly opposed to that. The president help up a list of Republican lawmakers who have boasted about the benefits of the package for their districts’ businesses and services. “I mean, some people have no shame,” Biden said with a laugh. “We’ve turned the tide on the once-in-a-century pandemic,” Biden said. “And now we’re faced with a question: what kind of economy are we going to build for tomorrow? What are we going to do? I believe this is our moment to rebuild an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.”  The president credited his administration with helping to bring back jobs that had disappeared at the beginning of the pandemic and making vaccines widely available. “Covid cases are down. Covid deaths are down. Unemployment filings are down. Hunger is down. Vaccinations are up. Jobs are up. Growth is up,” Biden said. “Put it simply, America is coming back. America is on the move.”Standing in front of signs saying “Blue Collar Blueprint for America,” Biden noted US businesses have been reopening in recent weeks, as vaccinations ramp up. The president also made a joke about Ohio’s million-dollar lottery to encourage residents to get their coronavirus vaccinations. “I hear that Ohio has a new millionaire,” Biden said. Once the tour concludes, the president will deliver remarks on the economy at the community college’s metropolitan campus, so stay tuned.“We’re going to have to close this down soon,” Biden has remarked of his conversations with Republicans.  The GOP counter-proposal to Biden’s infrastructure plan is $928bn over eight years, but the majority is money that Congress was already expected to green-light.  On Friday, Biden lowered his infrastructure proposal to $1.7tn, down from an initial $2.25tn proposal, Bloomberg says.

But the shadow social care minister, Liz Kendall, said that explanation “simply doesn’t stack up”. “There were over 530,000 tests carried out in the UK by 20 April, yet they couldn’t test 25,000 people discharged from hospitals to care homes, after we saw it sweep through care homes in Italy, France and America?” she said. “The reality is, they wanted to free up the beds and they didn’t prioritise older people.” She accused Hancock, who previously claimed to have thrown a “protective ring” around care homes, of changing his story to “wriggle out” of responsibility. My colleague Aubrey Allegretti has the story: Macron said France was on track to deliver 30 million Covid-19 vaccination doses to Africa by year-end, that Germany would also deliver 30 million doses and that collectively the European Union would deliver more than 100 million doses to Africa this year. “To help Africa get vaccinated ... is first of all a duty of solidarity, and it’s also quite simply ...in the interest of all European countries, all the countries in the world,” said Macron during a visit to a vaccination centre in Kigali on the sidelines of a state visit. He said that if all countries did not get vaccinations, the virus will continue to spread and develop new variants which then in turn may reappear in countries that have already vaccinated their populations. “Therefore this strategy is not just a moral duty, but a health requirement,” Macron said. The COVAX facility, backed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), aims to secure 2 billion vaccine doses for lower-income countries by the end of 2021.  “A whirlwind,” Abigail Bugenske, 22, said on Thursday morning during a news conference. “It absolutely has not processed yet. I am still digesting it — and I like to say that it feels like this is happening to a different person. I cannot believe it.” Bugenske said she plans to donate to charities but then invest most of it. The winner of a full college scholarship was eighth grader Joseph Costello of Englewood near Dayton. “Very excited,” Costello said as he sat between his parents, Colleen and Rich, during the virtual news conference. Although it’s a long way off, Joseph said he’s thought about Ohio State or Miami of Ohio for college. Bugenske said she received the Moderna vaccine as soon as she was eligible, long before the lottery was announced. The Costellos said they were already vaccinated and had planned to have their children vaccinated by the end of the month, but the lottery announcement inspired them to move those appointments up. During a scheduled visit to Cleveland, the US president Joe Biden said, “Ohio has a new millionaire! I tell you what, who wouldathunk it, a million bucks for getting a vaccine? But it’s working.” More than 2.7 million adults signed up for the $1 million prize and more than 104,000 children aged 12-17 entered the drawing for the scholarship, which includes tuition, room and board, and books. Four more $1 million and college scholarship winners will be announced each Wednesday for the next four weeks. DeWine, a Republican, announced the program May 12 to boost lagging vaccination rates. The Ohio Lottery conducted the first drawing Monday afternoon at its draw studio in Cleveland using a random number generator to pick the winners ahead of time, and then confirmed the eligibility of the ultimate winner. Participants must register to enter by phone or via the Vax-a-Million website. Teens can register themselves, but parents or legal s must verify their eligibility. The names of entrants who don’t win will be carried over week to week. The deadline for new registrations is just before midnight on Sunday. “I know that some may say, DeWine, you’re crazy! This million-dollar drawing idea of yours is a waste of money,’” the governor said when he announced the incentive. But with the vaccine now readily available, the real waste, “is a life lost to Covid-19,” the governor said. But the same review also found that vaccination rates are still well below figures from earlier in April and March. Vax-a-Million is open to permanent Ohio residents who have received either the one-dose Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine or their first part of the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccination. DeWine’s proposal inspired similar vaccine-incentive lotteries in Colorado, Maryland, New York state and Oregon. In Colorado, the Democratic governor Jared Polis said the state will have a weekly lottery for five residents to win $1 million to incentivise vaccinations. Colorado is setting aside $5 million of federal coronavirus relief funds that would have gone toward vaccine advertising for five residents to win $1 million each.“Africa needs vaccines now,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa. “Any pause in our vaccination campaigns will lead to lost lives and lost hope.” The WHO statement underlined the importance of respecting the recommended interval of eight to 12 weeks between doses to ensure a recipient’s prolonged 81 per cent protection rate. As of 26 May the continent had registered more than 4.7m cases of coronavirus with nearly 130,000 deaths attributed to the virus.The US president Joe Biden ordered aides to find answers to the origin of the virus that causes Covid-19, saying on Wednesday that US intelligence agencies are pursuing rival theories potentially including the possibility of a laboratory accident in China. “It is critical that China provides independent experts full access to complete, original data and samples relevant to understanding the source of the virus and the early stages of the pandemic,” the US mission to the UN in Geneva said in a statement.  My colleague Peter Beaumont has put together this explainer on what we know so far about the animal host and lab leak theories: The variant, known as B.1.617.2, is now dominant in the UK and has been linked to a rise in cases in hotspots around the country. Data released on Thursday by Public Health England (PHE) shows 6,959 cases have been confirmed so far in the UK, up from 3,424 the week before. Meanwhile, experts said the link between Covid cases and hospital admissions had been greatly weakened but not broken. Speaking in the Commons on Thursday, the health secretary said Covid cases were now at their highest level since 12 April, with 3,180 reported in the UK on Wednesday, but thanks to vaccinations the “link from cases to hospitalisations and to deaths is being severed”. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) statement did not identify which two of the 17 agencies constituting the US intelligence community believed that the virus had originated with infected animals and which agency believed it originated with a laboratory accident. In both cases, however, ODNI said the agencies which did lean to one or the other explanation did so with “low or moderate confidence” - which in spy jargon means they believe the evidence supporting their view is far from conclusive. Officials declined to discuss which agencies had voiced tentative views on the virus’ origin, Reuters reports, but stressed that a large majority of US agencies believe information is insufficient to determine that one scenario for the virus’ origin was more likely than the other. Small groups of vaccinated foreign tourists - up to 30 people - have been allowed to enter as of last Sunday, Reuters reports. The tourism ministry expects 20 such groups to come from countries, including the US, Britain and Germany, under a pilot programme until 15 June. The ministry then hopes to expand the number of groups and, in July, allow inidual tourists. The health ministry also reported 142 new coronavirus deaths in hospitals.

As a result of the recent cyberattack on the HSE’s systems, there had been no new reports of Covid-19 deaths since Friday, May 14th, when the State’s total death toll stood at 4,941. Speaking at a weekly briefing on Thursday, the HSE’s chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said there had been eight deaths from Covid-19 in the 12 days from the data breach to Wednesday. The latest figures will bring the number of reported deaths in May as a result of Covid-19 to 43. Dr Henry said the number of deaths from the disease had “collapsed” as a result of the Covid-19 vaccination programme being targeted at elderly people first, who are much more at risk of dying as a result of Covid-19. There were 2,234 new Covid-19 cases in the second week in January in the over-75s. As a result of the vaccination programme, there have been just 65 cases per week in that age group in the last fortnight. “Hospitalisations, deaths and outbreaks – anything associated with the vaccinated populations have collapsed,” Dr Henry said. He said there is a “steady level” of disease happening at present, but it is being concentrated in the under-45s. The Department of Health has revised its Covid-19 figures since the data breach. In the 12 days after the cyberattack on the HSE there were 5,133 new cases, an average of 428 a day. This is 140 more cases than the 4,993 cases that were originally reported for the period. Northern Ireland’s Department of Health, meanwhile, reported 84 new cases of Covid-19 and no further fatalities on Thursday.

Photograph: Dimas ArdianBloombergImmunity to the coronavirus lasts at least a year, probably much longer, and improves over time especially after vaccination, according to two new studies. The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.Together, the studies suggest that most people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who were later immunised will not need boosters. Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response.Both reports looked at people who had been exposed to the coronavirus about a year earlier. Cells that retain a memory of the virus persist in the bone marrow and may churn out antibodies whenever needed, according to one of the studies, published Monday in the journal Nature.The other study, which is also under review for publication in Nature, found that these so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least 12 months after the initial infection.“The papers are consistent with the growing body of literature that suggests that immunity elicited by infection and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 appears to be long-lived,” said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research.The studies may soothe fears that immunity to the virus is transient, as is the case with coronaviruses that cause common colds. But those viruses change significantly every few years, Hensley said.“The reason we get infected with common coronaviruses repetitively throughout life might have much more to do with variation of these viruses rather than immunity,” he said.‘Terrific response’In fact, memory B cells produced in response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 and enhanced with vaccination are so potent that they thwart even variants of the virus, negating the need for boosters, according to Michel Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York who led the study on memory maturation.“People who were infected and get vaccinated really have a terrific response, a terrific set of antibodies, because they continue to evolve their antibodies,” Mr Nussenzweig said. “I expect that they will last for a long time.” The result may not apply to protection derived from vaccines alone, because immune memory is likely to be organised differently after immunisation, compared with that following natural infection. That means people who have not had Covid-19 and have been immunised may eventually need a booster shot, Nussenzweig said. “That’s the kind of thing that we will know very, very soon,” he said. Upon first encountering a virus, B cells rapidly proliferate and produce antibodies in large amounts. Once the acute infection is resolved, a small number of the cells take up residence in the bone marrow, steadily pumping out modest levels of antibodies.To look at memory B cells specific to the new coronavirus, researchers led by Ali Ellebedy of Washington University in St. Louis analysed blood from 77 people at three-month intervals, starting about a month after their infection with the coronavirus. Only six of the 77 had been hospitalised for Covid-19 the rest had mild symptoms.Antibody levels in these iniduals dropped rapidly four months after infection and continued to decline slowly for months afterward – results that are in line with those from other studies. Some scientists have interpreted this decrease as a sign of waning immunity, but it is exactly what is expected, other experts said. If blood contained high quantities of antibodies to every pathogen the body had ever encountered, it would quickly transform into a thick sludge.Acute infectionInstead, blood levels of antibodies fall sharply following acute infection, while memory B cells remain quiescent in the bone marrow, ready to take action when needed. Ellebedy’s team obtained bone marrow samples from 19 people roughly seven months after they had been infected. Fifteen had detectable memory B cells, but four did not, suggesting that some people might carry very few of the cells or none at all.“It tells me that even if you got infected, it doesn’t mean that you have a super immune response,” Ellebedy said. The findings reinforce the idea that people who have recovered from Covid-19 should be vaccinated, he said. Nussenzweig’s team looked at how memory B cells mature over time. The researchers analysed blood from 63 people who had recovered from Covid-19 about a year earlier. The vast majority of the participants had mild symptoms, and 26 had also received at least one dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.So-called neutralising antibodies, needed to prevent reinfection with the virus, remained unchanged between six and 12 months, while related but less important antibodies slowly disappeared, the team found. As memory B cells continued to evolve, the antibodies they produced developed the ability to neutralize an even broader group of variants. This ongoing maturation may result from a small piece of the virus that is sequestered by the immune system ? for target practice, so to speak.The results of Nussenzweig’s study suggest that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who have later been vaccinated will continue to have extremely high levels of protection against emerging variants, even without receiving a vaccine booster down the line.“It kind of looks exactly like what we would hope a good memory B cell response would look like,” said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the new research. – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Thousands of people aged under 50 could be given a mixed vaccine against Covid-19, under a new approach being considered by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).The vaccination programme could be changed to allow under-50s who have received a first dose of AstraZeneca to be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines as a second dose, Niac has told chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan. Niac also says it is keeping under review whether or not the interval between AstraZeneca shots should be cut from 12 weeks to eight, and is also looking at the vaccination of children with high-risk medical conditions.Earlier this year, after rare but serious blood clots were found in people who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine, Niac recommended mRNA vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) for under-50s. However, at least 40,000 people, many of them healthcare workers, have already received a first dose of AstraZeneca and are awaiting a second dose.Niac says there is now published evidence of the safety of “heterologous” vaccine schedules, in which doses of two different vaccines are administered against Covid-19.At its meeting this week, Niac examined emerging data on very rare clotting events linked to AstraZeneca. Niac has told Dr Holohan in a letter it will review the safety of mixing vaccines as well as unpublished evidence of effectiveness.In the UK, the interval between doses of the AstraZeneca and mRNA vaccines has been cut from 12 weeks to eight due to the rise in Indian variant cases.

File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsRevised targets for the State’s vaccine campaign will be announced today (Friday) following the emergence of major new supply difficulties from pharmaceutical firmsAccepting that it is “likely” the 82 per cent target by the end of June will not be met, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, however, went on: “If we do miss targets we’ll only miss them by a few weeks. Instead of the end of June, it would be early July.”Speaking ahead of the announcement of new Covid-19 relaxation plans, Mr Varadkar promised “very positive” reopening news, and a return to international travel, events and other areas.The public has every reason to be hopeful, he said, because Covid-19 case numbers are stable, with 100 hospitalisations for Covid-19 and 50 people in intensive care. Indeed, the State is “ahead of ourselves” on hospital targets.HSE chief executive Paul Reid told the weekly HSE briefing that the State will receive just half of expected AstraZeneca vaccine deliveries in coming weeks, while Pfizer numbers will be 30,000 down.In a statement to The , Pfizer said “We’re committed to delivering 250m doses under the agreement with the European Commission in Q2. This consists of the planned 200m doses plus 50m doses, accelerated from their scheduled delivery later in 2021.“Any minor variation in a delivery as part of this plan is a result of us ensuring equitable distribution within the bloc of those accelerated doses over the coming weeks.”The HSE does not know how many Johnson\u0026ampJohnson vaccines it will receive, but the number could at best be just half of the 600,000 expected. At worst it could be just 64,000.So far 60,000 Johnson\u0026ampJohnson doses have been received this month, most of which have been administered. A small delivery is due over this weekend, he told reporters..Speaking in the Dáil on Thursday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane that reaching the 82 per cent target by the end of June for first doses depended on supply.“Anyone who wants a vaccine should be fully vaccinated by the end of September,” he declared, adding that half of all adults will have received their first dose by the end of this week.Take-upSpeaking at the HSE briefing, the HSE chief executive said that 2.6 million people have received a vaccine dose: 1.6 million first doses and 800,000 second doses.The take-up of vaccines is 98.4 per cent among those over 80 95.5 per cent among 70 year olds and 89.1 per cent among 60 year olds. Among those in their 50s, where vaccination is continuing, the take-up is 78.5 per cent.Between 304,000 and 314,000 people got a vaccine last week. This week, the target will be between 260,000 to 280,000 at 37 mass -vaccination centres. A new centre opens in University College Dublin next week.Mr Reid rejected Dáil complaints by rural TDs about long journey times to some vaccination centres, with some Deputies alleging the vaccination rollout was biased towards Dublin.The Republic has more centres per head of population than Northern Ireland, Mr Reid pointed out – where there is one per 100,000 people, compared to one per 300,000.While patients living in rural Ireland have faced longer journeys to vaccination centres, he pointed out that in Dublin and other areas patients can face equally long journeys in bad traffic.Ambulance staff are dealing with almost 4,000 referrals for administering the vaccine, officials said. Some 940 patients did not require vaccination and 240 are still waiting for one.Eight people have died with Covid-19 since May 15th.The number of B.1617.2 variant cases – the so-called Indian variant – has risen to 97, with another 58 cases of a related sub-type, B.1617.1, recorded, the HSE said.Second doseMeanwhile, it emerged that 240 people who are unable to leave their homes because of age and illness have yet to receive a first vaccine dose. So far 2,700 others have got a first jab, while 1,400 have received their second dose.Minister of State for Older People Mary Butler said the work was being carried out by the National Ambulance Service. Each visit takes at least 30 minutes, and sometimes longer.Minister of State Anne Rabbitte said most people in homes for the disabled or those enjoying daycare services among the 271,000 Cohort IV high-risk group have received a first jab. Some 11 per cent have been fully vaccinated.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"volunteer divers find car in water off pier in crosshaven","story":"Crosshaven in Co Cork. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe missing man who may be linked to the car found off Hugh Coveney pier is Barry Coughlan (23) of Crosshaven, Co Cork who disappeared in May 2004. Last seen outside the Moonduster Bar, Crosshaven between 1.30am and 2am on Saturday morning May 1st, 2004, his car -,a rust coloured Toyota Corolla with the licence plate 98 C 18625 - was parked nearby. The car was not accounted for after Mr Coughlan disappeared without trace. At the time of his disappearance he was working as a fisherman. He should have been back in Castletownbere for work on May 2nd, 2004. His disappearance was completely out of character. He was last seen wearing a navy hooded top with “ Old Navy” logo on the front, blue wrangler jeans and blue runners with beige trim and the “Sketchers” logo. At the time of his disappearance he was described as being 6ft 1in tall, with black hair, blue eyes and a slim build.Whilst gardaí have not made any formal comment it is understood that the car discovered in Crosshaven matches the make and model of Mr Coughlan’s car and that a partial registration match has been made.Mr Coughlan’s relatives and friends have continued to make appeals in relation to his disappearance over the years.Last year Deliveroo partnered with the National Missing Persons Helpline for their Bring Them Home campaign, which aims to reunite friends and families with their missing loved ones.For the month of December, Deliveroo riders featured images of five missing people on their bags in an effort to raise awareness of their cases. Mr Coughlan was among the five people chosen to appear on the bags. Earlier, volunteer ers found the remains of a car in waters off the pier in Crosshaven.The discovery of the car hidden by silt and mud was made on Wednesday by members of Cork Missing Persons Search and Recovery Group, who were using sonar technology during a training exercise on a rib.It is believed the car may have belonged to the local man who went missing in 2004. A search was conducted after he went missing in the early hours of May 1st, 2004, but nothing was then found.His family have now been alerted by gardaí, and some were on the pier on Wednesday evening. The car is in very poor condition. Garda ers have travelled to Crosshaven to help retrieve it, but recovery could take time because of its brittle nature.Chris O’Donoghue, of the Cork Missing Persons Search and Recovery Group, said they had gone out in a rib with Starfish sonar in operation when the unexpected discovery occurred.He said the group have long had the missing man in their thoughts, and had previously conducted searches for him in a bid to bring his remains back to his family for a proper burial. Gardaí were immediately alerted.“We had planned to search the sea around Crosshaven but found the car close to the pier. Mud, sand and silt moves with the sea movements, and we were lucky in our search,” he told reporters.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 nphet clears way for indoor dining from july 5th","story":"From July 5th, indoor services at restaurants and bars can reopen.

Photograph: Mohammed SaberEPAIreland has become the first EU member state to declare the building of Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories as de facto annexation, after the Dáil on Wednesday night passed a motion tabled by Sinn Fein. The Dáil rejected, however, a proposal to expel the Israeli ambassador to the Republic and impose comprehensive sanctions against Israel by 87 votes to 46, with no abstentions.A spokesman for Israel’s foreign ministry said it “outright rejects” the motion.Lior Haiat said on Twitter that Ireland’s “outrageous and baseless” position regarding some Israeli settlements reflects a “blatantly one-sided and simplistic policy” and constitutes a “victory for extremist Palestinian factions”. “The motion distances Ireland from its ambition to contribute and play a constructive role in the Israeli-Palestinian context,” he wrote.Mr Haiat said the vote followed “unacceptable anti-Israel statements that were heard in Ireland at a time when the citizens of Israel were being subject to terror attacks by the more than 4,000 rockets that were launched from the Gaza Strip by the Hamas terrorist organization.”The Government had in a debate on Tuesday night supported the Sinn Féin proposal and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said during debate on the issue that “we need to be honest with what is happening on the ground and call it out” as “de facto annexation”.He added that the Republic is the first EU country to state this and it could be a message to the global community.Mr Coveney echoed the comments of Sinn Féin foreign affairs spokesman John Brady, who said that “we are baldly stating that Israel is acting illegally under international law”.Sinn Féin had accepted for their motion a Government amendment condemning the actions of militant Palestinian group Hamas.Cabinet meetingA Cabinet meeting was held on Tuesday and agreed to back the Sinn Féin proposal if the party included reference to violence “on all sides in the conflict”, following intense violence in the Gaza region over the past two weeks before a ceasefire was called.More than 240 Palestinians have been killed in the outbreak of violence, including 66 children, with 10 Israeli deaths, including two children.Mr Coveney had said he found it “deeply troubling” that Sinn Féin could not bring itself to also condemn the actions of Hamas for also killing children and innocent civilians.However, when the Minister insisted in Tuesday’s debate on the condemnation of “the killing of civilians by both sides in this conflict”, Sinn Féin accepted this amendment without a vote.People Before Profit had introduced the amendment calling for the ambassador’s expulsion to the Sinn Féin motion. The Dáil passed the Sinn Féin motion itself on Wednesday night.People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett, speaking before the vote on his party’s amendment, described it as “historic” and said that it was the first time the Irish parliament would vote on the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.“Most likely it is the first time any parliament in the EU has held such a vote,” he said.Amendment wordingThe rejected amendment stated that “the Israeli apartheid system through its ongoing ethnic cleansing, brutal state repression and murderous military violence, including four savage military assaults on Gaza in recent years, has no place among the international community of nations”.It called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and “all Israeli diplomatic staff”, as well as for the application of “a comprehensive package of economic, political and cultural sanctions against the state of Israel, similar to that applied to apartheid South Africa”.The amendment also called for the maintenance of such sanctions and their promotion within the EU and internationally “until the entire Israeli apartheid system is dismantled and all the Palestinian people enjoy national self-determination and full and equal rights”.

Photograph: OPWThe Dáil’s spending watchdog has found that a new €86.6 million headquarters for An Garda Síochana is no longer fit for purpose as it won’t be big enough to fit all personnel from the Garda units that were due to move there. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has today published a report on a number of issues it identified with projects undertaken by the Office of Public Works (OPW) and it accused the agency of “poor management” of the Garda development.The committee examined the construction of a Garda complex at Military Road, Dublin 8 which is due to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. The report says that the estimated cost is €86.6 million, a €6.6 million increase on the original estimate. It is due to replace the current Garda accommodation at Harcourt Square which is being leased from a commercial landlord. During its investigation into the project the PAC requested information from the OPW on the selection process for the Military Road site and whether potential future increases in Garda personnel informed the decision. The PAC notes that a Policing Authority report published in 2019 shows the Garda Commissioner stated that the development at Military Road will not be sufficient to accommodate all units currently based in Harcourt Square. The OPW told the PAC that in 2016 there were 850 to 890 members of Garda personnel based in Harcourt Square and that the Military Road complex will be sufficient to accommodate the same number of staff upon completion. However, the PAC report says that the OPW also explained that recent increases in Garda personnel, combined with changes to Garda operations, has resulted in other locations being required to house some of the units currently based in Harcourt Square. However, they also explained that contingency plans using State owned and leased premises are in development to accommodate anticipated further increases in Garda personnel and operationsThe PAC report says that developing a premises based on 2016 staff numbers and operational needs “does not represent best practice”. It added that this “is compounded by the fact that as early as 2018 the OPW and An Garda Síochána were aware that An Garda Síochána’s staff numbers had increased and that the organisation had undergone organisational change.”The PAC report says: “the failure to review the Military Road development in 2018 based on these factors represents poor management and has resulted in a major capital project no longer being fit for purpose.”Covid-19 delaysThere have been delays in construction due to Covid-19 and the PAC previously quizzed the OPW on whether it will be completed on time, and if a contingency plan exists to manage such delays.The OPW told the committee it expects the site to be completed on time but said there is a contingency plan to use a number of existing Garda buildings to accommodate staff if the development is delayed. The PAC report says that “due to the on-going pandemic the Committee is of the opinion that further delays are highly likely.”The PAC recommends that the OPW develops a detailed contingency plan to accommodate the staff in Harcourt Square if the Military Road development is not completed on time. It also says the OPW should “keep all of its projects in the planning stages under review to ensure that any changes, such as staff increases or operational change, are incorporated into the plans and that construction does not commence until all parties are satisfied that the project will meet the needs of the client Department, both at the time and into the future.”The PAC says that “this will help ensure that public funds expended on capital projects provide long-term value-for-money for the State and the taxpayer. “Failure to proactively manage capital projects in this way can result in additional expenditure,” it warns.Vacant propertiesThe report also looks at vacant Garda property after the closure of 139 stations between 2012 and 2013. Thirty-six of the stations were disposed of between 2014 and 2016 but this process was halted for two years due to two Garda reviews related to the vacant properties. Plans to sell stations resumed in 2019 and the OPW said last month that there were 49 vacant Garda properties that were either being prepared for disposal or under consideration for community or County Council use. The PAC report says nine of the properties identified were vacant prior to 2012 and says that given that these have been vacant for up to a decade “the OPW has not been pro-active enough in maximising the potential of the State’s assets.”The PAC report says there are “on-going issues” with the lease of Miesian Plaza, the headquarters of the Department of Health and also accommodates other State agenciesThe OPW’s mis-measurement of the floor space for the building is expected to result in an over-payment of €10 million during the lifetime of the lease. In October 2018 the OPW stated that it was negotiating with the owner of the premises in an attempt to have the floor space measurements upon which the lease is based recalibrated and last November it confirmed the negotiations were still ongoing. The PAC report says the committee “remains concerned that the OPW will not succeed in preventing taxpayers being exposed for an additional €10 million that is a direct result of a fundamental error by OPW. “The Committee is also unsatisfied that after two years of negotiations with the landlord that no substantial developments have taken place.”The PAC recommends that the OPW “takes all necessary steps to prevent the forecasted loss of approximately €10 million and that the OPW ensures it has appropriately qualified staff to manage its property transactions on behalf of the State.”‘Significant failing’Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said there was a “a lack of future proofing” for the Garda complex project in terms of the number of people to be accommodated there and also the tight nature of the site which she argued is difficult to access from congested roads. She said there are questions to be asked about the choice of such a restricted site for the development while suggesting the fact that it was State-owned was a factor in that. Ms Murphy also said there is concern the site may not be finished on time and the State will incur a “double cost” in moving gardaí from Harcourt Square to temporary premises and then on to Military Road.PAC Cathaoirleach Brian Stanley said the committee will be monitoring future costs related to the project - including contingency plans for accommodating Gardaí in leased premises - questioning if it will lead to “collateral damage to the public purse”."},{"url":null,"title":"q a what are the latest plans for the easing of covid 19 restrictions this summer","story":"Outdoor hospitality is set to resume from June 7th. File photograph: Hollie AdamsGetty ImagesThe Cabinet will meet on Friday to agree another phase of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions over the summer months. Ahead of that the Cabinet coronavirus subcommittee met on Thursday to finetune the proposals. The State’s national public health team will be giving their advice, too. A meeting of the three Coalition party leaders looks likely on Friday morning. Later in the day Taoiseach Micheál Martin will outline changes in the areas of aviation and international travel, hospitality and sport in an address. Here is what we know so far.Q: There has been a lot of talk in relation to the digital green cert and travelling around Europe, but what is the plan here?A: It is likely there will be a few elements to the Taoiseach’s address to the nation on Friday and the first will be in relation to the introduction of EU Covid-19 certificates, otherwise known as the EU digital green certificate, to allow greater movement within the bloc.The quickly advancing vaccination programmes in Ireland, the US, the EU and Britain give the Government good room for manoeuvre in easing travel restrictions for these states.The green cert is likely to be ready to go at a European level from the start of July. It looks as though the Government will seek to operationalise this quickly and by mid-July.Then there is the question of allowing non-essential travel to the UK and US. Minister for Arts Catherine Martin suggested earlier this week that this could be a little further out than European travel. There had been suggestions of a travel bubble between Ireland and Britain, but given ongoing concerns in relation to the so-called Indian Covid-19 variant, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) may have something to say about this. Separately, the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both come under pressure from their respective parliamentary parties to ensure that Friday’s announcement includes some kind of support for the aviation sector, which has suffered significant financial losses in the pandemic, although both have previously pointed to the existing level of support via State pandemic schemes.Q: What can we expect on hospitality and sport?A: Once again, there will be a few different elements to this part of the announcement.In terms of restaurants and pubs, the Taoiseach will finally give a date for the planned resumption of indoor hospitality. From July 5th, indoor services in restaurants and bars will be allowed to reopen.Mr Martin will also announce a series of pilot live concerts, gigs and matches across June and July. These will be of varying sizes and across different genres. Stadiums with a capacity of 5,000 or more will be allowed to host attendances of 200 but there will also be test events which are expected to involve larger crowds. The use of antigen testing as part of these test events is considered likely. The Tánaiste has also suggested that smaller, community type events, with up to 200 people in attendance, will be permitted in appropriate venues.Meanwhile, cinemas are set to reopen on June 7th.Q: Will there be a vaccination bonus?A: The last time the Government announced an easing of restrictions, there was also a significant bonus included for those who have been vaccinated. This included allowing a vaccinated household meet indoors with one other vaccinated household. Many of those planning weddings, for example, have recently questioned whether they can bolster their invite list with vaccinated guests. It’s not yet clear what moves the Government will make on this. For the moment the rule is that up to 50 people are permitted to attend religious services, which include weddings and funerals as well as Masses. Indoor wedding parties are currently capped at six guests, with a maximum of 15 guests allowed at outdoor parties. There will be many people anxious to see those numbers increased significantly. Q: Will we be told what to expect in relation to the vaccination campaign over the summer?A: Yes. It emerged in the Dáil on Thursday morning that the State will likely miss its target for offering a first Covid-19 vaccine dose to 82 per cent of adults here because of a looming shortfall in deliveries of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. It is understood the Government will provide revised vaccination targets as part of its announcements on Friday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"largest ever map of dark matter completed by scientists","story":"Undated handout image issued by the Dark Energy Survey of a map showing areas of dark matter. Photograph: N JeffreyDark Energy Survey collaborationPA WireResearchers have created the largest ever map of dark matter, invisible material thought to account for 80 per cent of the total matter of the universe.As matter curves space-time, astronomers are able to map its existence by looking at light travelling to Earth from distant galaxies.If the light has been distorted, this means there is matter in the foreground, bending the light as it comes towards us.A team co-led by UCL researchers, as part of the international Dark Energy Survey (DES), used artificial intelligence to analyse images of 100 million galaxies, looking at their shape, spots of light made up of 10 or so pixels, to see if they have been stretched.The new map, a representation of all matter detected in the foreground of the observed galaxies, covers one-quarter of the southern hemisphere’s sky.Co-lead author Dr Niall Jeffrey, of UCL’s physics and astronomy department, said: “Most of the matter in the universe is dark matter.“It is a real wonder to get a glimpse of these vast, hidden structures across a large portion of the night sky.“These structures are revealed using the distorted shapes of hundreds of millions of distant galaxies with photographs from the Dark Energy Camera in Chile.“In our map, which mainly shows dark matter, we see a similar pattern as we do with visible matter only, a web-like structure with dense clumps of matter separated by large empty voids.“Observing these cosmic-scale structures can help us to answer fundamental questions about the universe.”For decades astronomers have suspected there is more material in the universe than we can see.Dark matter, like dark energy, remains mysterious, but its existence is inferred from galaxies behaving in unpredicted ways – for instance, the fact that galaxies stay clustered together, and that galaxies within clusters move faster than expected.Densest regionsCo-author Prof Ofer Lahav, also of UCL and chairman of the DES UK consortium, said: “Visible galaxies form in the densest regions of dark matter.“When we look at the night sky, we see the galaxy’s light but not the surrounding dark matter, like looking at the lights of a city at night.“By calculating how gravity distorts light, a technique known as gravitational lensing, we get the whole picture, both visible and invisible matter.“This brings us closer to understanding what the universe is made of and how it has evolved.“It also shows the power of artificial intelligence methods to analyse one of the largest datasets in astronomy.”The map is described in a new paper posted on the DES website and to be published in the Monthly Notices Of The Royal Astronomical Society. –PA"},{"url":null,"title":"west vows to pile sanctions on belarus after ryanair incident","story":" Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko: Due to meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Friday. Photograph:  Siarhei LeskiecAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union and other western powers have pledged to ramp up pressure on Belarus after it forced a Ryanair plane to land so that an opposition activist on board could be arrested, as Russia refused entry clearance to at least two European airlines in an apparent show of solidarity with its neighbour and ally.Veteran Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko is due to meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Friday, five days after his regime told a Ryanair flight en route from Greece to Lithuania that it faced a bomb threat and should land at Minsk airport, where Roman Protasevich and girlfriend Sofia Sapega were detained.The EU subsequently barred Belarusian airlines from the bloc and urged EU-based carriers to avoid the country’s airspace, and on Thursday foreign ministers from member states began discussing the imposition of sanctions on key areas of the Belarusian economy such as potash production, energy and finance.“It is clear that we will not be satisfied with small sanctions steps, but that we aim to target the economic structure and financial transactions in Belarus significantly with sanctions,” said German foreign minister Heiko Maas. As he met EU counterparts in Lisbon, Mr Maas said the bloc would “continue to look at what effects this has in Belarus, whether Lukashenko relents. If that isn’t the case, we have to assume that this will be just the beginning of a big and long spiral of sanctions.”Political prisonersGermany’s top diplomat said a key litmus test would be whether Mr Lukashenko freed more than 400 political prisoners arrested during a brutal crackdown on his critics in response to huge opposition protests last summer.“We demand the immediate and unconditional release of Roman Protasevich, as well as all other journalists and political prisoners held in Belarus,” G7 foreign ministers and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.“We will enhance our efforts, including through further sanctions as appropriate, to promote accountability for the actions of the Belarusian authorities.”The group also echoed a call from Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan for a full investigation into the Ryanair incident by International Civil Aviation Organisation. Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 27 years, insists Belarusian officials believed the bomb threat against the airliner to be potentially real and so behaved properly in scrambling a fighter jet to escort the airliner to Minsk.Belarusian claims that the bomb warning came from Hamas were widely ridiculed, and London-based research group Dossier Centre has published what it says is the email containing the threat – which was sent 24 minutes after Minsk air traffic control warned the Ryanair crew of the supposed danger.Mr Lukashenko accused Mr Protasevich (26) of plotting a “bloody revolt” in Belarus with foreign backing, and claimed the West was using the incident to “strangle” his country with sanctions and put pressure on its chief ally, Russia.Austrian Airlines said it cancelled Thursday’s Vienna-Moscow flight after Russian aviation authorities refused to allow it to re-route around Belarus, and Air France cancelled its Paris-Moscow flight for the second day running for the same reason.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

On Christmas Day 2019, in response to the warning I had given to Dr Jessen, he tweeted \u0027Laugh Out Loud\u0027. I don\u0027t think he will be laughing too much today.  He added: My client is very satisfied with the substantial sum in damages awarded by the court today. Indeed I believe this is a record award for a tweet.The award also takes into account a number of aggravating factors in this case, including Dr Jessen\u0027s failure to retract and apologise. Dr Jessen has been offered every opportunity to do the right thing in this regard from the outset, but he has pointedly failed to do so.My client is grateful to the court for this total vindication which hopefully will also act as an encouragement and a watershed for all women in public life who have been subjected to similar attacks on social media.  Earlier, in his ruling, Mr Justice McAlinden said: The offending tweet remained on the defendant\u0027s Twitter account for two weeks, a Twitter account with 311,000 followers.The tweet was liked approximately 3,500 times and it was retweeted 517 times. The fact that the defendant failed to take down the offending tweet was the subject of mainstream media coverage.This outrageously bad libel cut her (Mrs Foster) to the core, causing her considerable upset, distress, humiliation, embarrassment and hurt.Bearing in mind the time of year and the work-related pressures the plaintiff was under at that time, I fully accept this libel took a heavy emotional toll despite her experience of dealing with the heat of robust political debate.Her marriage, her family life and her faith are the most important things in her life. These things provide important pillars of support and it was these things that were publicly trashed.Giving evidence last month, Mrs Foster told the court the incident came at a particularly stressful time when she was involved in talks to resurrect the powersharing government in the region. She said she felt the rumour of the affair with a close protection officer, which she described as having emerged online from anonymous accounts before the tweet by Dr Jessen, was designed to destabilise her at a critical time.I think the attack on me personally and my marriage was meant to destabilise me at a very critical time, she told the court.It was meant to destabilise me and thereby destabilise the negotiations as well. I have no proof of that, but I just think the timing of it is very significant given when it came.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"biting back would dilyn dog say evidence","story":"Westminster is reeling. During an extraordinary seven-hour hearing in Parliament on Wednesday, the Prime Minister’s former chief adviser Dominic Cummings made a string of explosive claims about his numerous enemies in Downing Street.Many of these claims, however, are disputed. And given the seriousness of Cummings’s allegations, MPs will surely want to give each of his foes a right of reply.Roll on the next sensational hearing…Greg Clark MP: “Dilyn the Downing Street dog, thank you very much for agreeing to appear before the committee today. It’s been widely reported that, during Dominic Cummings’s time in No 10, the two of you had a working relationship that was less than harmonious. Is this the case?”Dilyn: “Thank you, Mr Chair. I’ll be absolutely frank here: the man was never fit for office. In fact, I repeatedly advised the Prime Minister to get rid of him.”Greg Clark: “And how did the Prime Minister respond?”Dilyn: “He wouldn’t listen. He just looked at me as if I was barking.”Greg Clark: “What was it about Mr Cummings that you objected to?”Dilyn: “He was just a nightmare to have around the place. Poorly behaved. Constantly getting under everyone’s feet. Always making a mess. Clearly hadn’t been house-trained. Quite frankly, I don’t know where they got him from.”Greg Clark: “When Mr Cummings appeared before this committee, he suggested that you were a hindrance to the work of Downing Street employees. According to him, Carrie Symonds ordered staff to spend their time rebutting negative coverage of you in the press, when they should have been dealing with far more important issues. Is this true?”Dilyn: “Look, all those stories about me were complete fabrications. Ever since I entered Downing Street, I have been the subject of a concerted smear campaign, clearly designed to undermine my position. And the press office had a duty to correct the record, so the public could see that these allegations about me were wholly unfounded.”Dilyn: “One, that the Prime Minister found me chewing a priceless antiquarian book at Chequers, and had to free it from my jaws. This is a total misrepresentation. In reality, I was simply bringing the book to the Prime Minister, because it was a classic treatise on the art of statesmanship, and I believed it contained valuable advice from which the PM could benefit. He accepted the book gratefully, and promised to add it to the top of his bedside reading pile.”Greg Clark: “But according to the account in the press, the Prime Minister shouted: ‘Someone please shoot that dog’.”Dilyn: “Again, this is an outrageous twisting of the truth. The Prime Minister meant ‘shoot’ as in ‘take photographs of’. He believed that publishing some charming pictures of his beloved pet would boost the public’s morale at a time of national crisis.”Greg Clark: “Who do you believe to have been the source of these briefings against you?”Dilyn: “There’s no doubt in my mind at all. From day one, it was obvious that Mr Cummings viewed me as a rival.”Dilyn: “He could see that I had the Prime Minister’s ear. Contrary to reports in the media, however, I was affectionately nibbling it – not biting. At no point did I draw blood.”Greg Clark: “You’ve made clear to this committee that you consider Mr Cummings to be an unreliable witness. Do you dispute his claim that, during a discussion in No 10 last year about whether to impose another lockdown, the Prime Minister said: ‘Let the bodies pile high’?”Dilyn: “Once again, this is an appalling misrepresentation. What the Prime Minister actually said was: ‘Let the Boddies pile high’ – as in, cans of Boddingtons Bitter. He was simply inviting everyone at the meeting to discuss the matter further over a few beers. It had been a long evening, and he wanted his advisers to let their hair down, enjoy a drink or two, and then resume the discussion. It was a perfectly innocent remark – and yet it’s been deliberately twisted to make the Prime Minister look bad.”Greg Clark: “Mr Cummings also told the committee that he quit Downing Street because the Prime Minister’s ‘girlfriend’, fiancée Carrie Symonds, was ‘trying to change a whole bunch of appointments at No 10’. According to him, she wished to ensure that those closest to her were given top jobs. Is this true?”Dilyn: “Absolute nonsense. The process by which I was offered the role of Downing Street press secretary was entirely above board. I declined purely because I wished to focus on other interests, such as chewing my tennis ball and chasing the squirrels in St James’s Park.”Greg Clark: “Dilyn the Downing Street dog, thank you very much for your time today. Have you anything further you wish to tell the committee?”Dilyn: “The problem in this crisis was that it was lions led by donkeys. Whereas the lions should obviously have been led by dogs.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can take mask now confusion reigns vaccinated americans","story":"This first appeared in the Letter from the USA newsletter. Sign up for expert insight and exclusive analysis on American politics, written every Thursday here.A few days ago I went to my local supermarket in a suburb of Washington.There was a sign on the door saying that, on the advice of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, masks are no longer required inside if you\u0027re fully vaccinated.More than half of adults in America, including myself, are now completely jabbed up.So I was surprised to discover that I was the only person in the store not wearing a mask.I\u0027ve since been to two more shops, including a monster-sized outlet called Target. Both of those stores, also on the advice of the CDC, do not require masks to be worn.Yet, on each occasion, everyone I saw inside - customers and staff - was still wearing them.On my way out of one shop I overheard two men talking about having had no ill effects after their second jabs. Yet they were both still wearing masks. In the car park.So what\u0027s going on here? Well, it appears a significant number of fully vaccinated Americans are needlessly wearing soggy cloths on their faces weeks after their own government told them they don\u0027t have to.On May 13, in a blaze of publicity, the CDC announced masks were no longer needed, indoors or out, if you are fully vaccinated.Today is a great day for America,” Joe Biden declared in the White House Rose Garden, removing his own face covering. If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask.Dr Rochelle Walensky, the CDC Director, said: We have all longed for this moment.Apparently, some were longing for it more than others.Far be it from me to suggest that my fellow vaccinated shoppers take their masks off. If someone wants to carry on wearing one until 2030 just in case that’s their right.But it just seems bonkers. When the foremost experts and the President have told you Hey, it’s OK to take it off now then why wouldn’t you?Maybe the message is taking time to get through. Although given the publicity that seems unlikely.Perhaps it’s just inertia, that mask wearing has become a habit. People have also been scared, and might just want to be doubly sure the pandemic really is over.Or, maybe they want to show solidarity with those who aren’t vaccinated. But if that’s the case it doesn’t make sense.If you want to encourage others to get jabbed, the best thing would be to remove your mask in the supermarket aisle, jump up and down on it, and shout Look at me. I\u0027ve been vaccinated. I\u0027m free.As America\u0027s most trusted coronavirus expert Dr Anthony Fauci explained, the CDC\u0027s decision to lift mask requirements for vaccinated people was fully intended to serve as an incentive for those who have been reluctant to get the vaccine.There is another possibility. The question of whether vaccinated people can still spread the virus at a low level is not definitively answered, and some Americans may be cautious about that.But the CDC has concluded it is safe for vaccinated people to roam around stores maskless. And the CDC knows what the risk is better than those who shop at Target.It is worth noting that mask wearing has always varied widely across America.At the height of the pandemic I went into a supermarket in the southern state of Georgia. All the people I could see were not wearing masks.Now, as the crisis moves towards its conclusion, the opposite is true in and around Washington - people are inexplicably refusing to ditch them.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dealings switzerland eu proving us right leaving","story":"Was the UK government a difficult customer when it came to negotiating a trade deal with the EU? No doubt Michel Barnier would want us to believe so - with his complaints about cherry-picking and wanting our cake and eating it. But the collapse of trade talks between the EU and Switzerland tells a different story.  Switzerland, which once filed an application to join the EU but never went along with it, has rubbed along for years quite happily on the back of a wad of bilateral trade agreements with the bloc – around 120 of them. Through those agreements it has functioned as a member of the single market, though remains outside the EU customs union - which allows it to do its own trade deals with third countries. For the Swiss it is a best-of-both-worlds arrangement - a model which was at one time touted as a possible blueprint for Britain’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU, although dismissed by the May government as it would have meant Britain remaining under the jurisdiction of the EU Court of Justice.  But this happy arrangement is about to be phased out - thanks to the EU trying to muscle its way into Swiss affairs in a way the Swiss found unacceptable. It started with the EU, eight years ago, wanting to roll those 120 bilateral trade agreements into one. It was a reasonable ambition you might think - a tidying-up exercise, a rationalisation which would make the rules easier for everyone to understand.But, needless to say, that wasn’t just what the EU had in mind. It wanted to seize the opportunity to extend its free movement rules to Switzerland and more effectively to impose its regulations on the country. In future, Switzerland was to be forced into ‘dynamic alignment’ with EU regulations. In other words, the EU would lay down the rules that it expected Switzerland to follow, on environmental law, labour law and everything else. Moreover, it expected Switzerland to bend to its social security rules, which, so the Swiss feared, would have meant EU citizens being able to settle in Switzerland and gain full access to its welfare system from day one.This was one of the main points on which David Cameron’s ill-fated attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU in 2015 failed. The EU refused to adjust its rules, even though they made it very difficult and expensive for a country, like Britain, with a universal benefits system to obey. When, say, a citizen of a relatively poor country like Romania can turn up and be eligible, from day one, for the same social benefits as a British citizen who has been working and paying taxes here for 40 years, it is asking for trouble.Not unreasonably, the Swiss, too, have decided that they won’t accept the EU trying to demand full access to its social security system and to deny the country the ability to make its own laws. It has withdrawn from the trade talks. That doesn’t mean Switzerland will fall into a ‘no deal’ situation as the 120 bilateral agreements will remain in place, but one by one they risk becoming obsolete as the EU ups its regulation and freezes out Swiss competition.There is a very clear conclusion to draw from the episode: trade arrangements which the EU found perfectly acceptable 20, 30, 40 years ago it no longer finds acceptable. The EU no longer simply wants free trade: it wants to muscle its way into many more aspects of its neighbours’ economic and social lives. Either you are a member of the EU, it is asserted, or we will try all we can to force you to become a de facto member.In taking this attitude, the EU is threatening free trade altogether. It is much easier to do a free trade deal if you are not trying to poke your nose into every aspect of the other country’s affairs. Remainers told us that we would never have the might to do trade deals on our own – we needed to be part of the EU.Yet the Swiss episode - eight years of negotiations for nothing - tells us something quite different. Over the coming years a nimbler, less-demanding Britain has the opportunity to open up trade with the rest of the world much more successfully than has the EU. Indeed, with its growing protectionism and arrogance, the EU risks going backwards.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"duke duchess cambridges royal tour scotland pictures","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been captivating the Scottish people on a Royal tour this week.From getting green-fingered in Starbank Park, Edinburgh to racing land yachting vehicles on the beach at St Andrews - and even playing a spot of tennis, the couple have continued to rise to the challenge. Click for the best pictures from their jam-packed week, which we\u0027ll be updating as they go. Comment: The crucial facts Cummings left out tell a very different story of lockdownPolice chief pledges to investigate every single burglary in national firstTraffic lights in London will automatically be set to redGirl experimented on by Nazis used Auschwitz tattoo to track down long-lost motherUK travellers may not need PCR test on return from green list countriesCouple accused of stealing village green in bitter row with Lake District localsMediterranean and Caribbean islands at front of race to join green listNavy fires back at Moscow’s claims that it chased HMS Dragon out of Russian watersTwo police officers accused of sharing photographs of murdered sisters \u0026#39sorry beyond measure\u0026#39Jacob Rees-Mogg tells disgraced Tory MP he should do \u0026#39honourable thing and resign\u0026#39Chinatown pop-up Covid clinic inundated after undocumented migrants told to come forwardNicola Sturgeon under pressure to end Glasgow’s lockdown to support businesses and \u0026#39give people hope\u0026#39Dominic Cummings revealed what many in Whitehall knew – he should never have been in chargeNHS staff to be stripped of free parking when lockdowns endArmy named best employer for mothers after introducing \u0026#39breastfeeding passport\u0026#39British expats to get lifetime general elections vote as Government scraps 15-year limitBiting back: what would Dilyn the dog say in his evidence?Leopards, tigers and a Zoroastrian fire altar: X-ray imaging reveals secrets of Viking hoardComment: \u0026#39I\u0026#39m Matt Hancock!\u0026#39 Backbenchers rally around the Health Secretary with the Spartacus defenceNo smartphone?

The erroneously published content included definitions and examples of behaviours that might be reportable.”He said that “some of those definitions and examples went beyond the policies discussed and agreed by colleagues” in the run-up to the website’s launch, adding: “That material should not have been there, and its publication was a mistake.”The vice-chancellor insisted that he “unambiguously” wants to “bolster the university’s reputation for enquiry and vigorous debate”.Prof Toope went on to say that Cambridge is “rightly known for offering people the space to think and to challenge conventions”.He said that the “mis-step” created the impression that the university might be “unduly” constraining freedom of expression.Dons described the personal letter from the vice-chancellor as a surprising development, with one adding: “It is unusual to have such a long email on one topic that in fact concedes the cock-up”.Another academic said: “It is obviously pretty embarrassing that the university has been planning this major new policy for over a year and they have had to do a U-turn within a week of it being launched.“It raises questions about how anything like this could have come within a mile of being approved by senior people at the university and published on their website.”He said it is “hard to believe” the material was published by mistake, “given how much work went into it”.Dr Arif Ahmed, a lecturer in philosophy at Gonville and Caius welcomed the vice-chancellor’s climb down, but said it is important to “get to the bottom” of what happened.“I think anything that involves anonymous reporting that is used for anything other than statistical process is so clearly contrary to ordinary rules of process,” he said.Dr James Orr of Cambridge’s Divinity Faculty said: “The vice-chancellor should be commended for doing the right thing.“But until the university\u0027s managers recognise that the free expression of many reasonable and plainly lawful beliefs can always be subjectively - and therefore unverifiably - construed as causing psychological harm, these sorts of crises will continue to occur.”The website had been created as part of a “Change the Culture” initiative that includes a series of policies and resources aimed at “clarifying expectations” about behaviour.A list of examples of micro-aggressions was provided on the website, including asking someone “where are you really from?” and misgendering a person, especially if they have already shared their pronouns.   This is the second free speech victory Cambridge dons have claimed in the past six months.On Thursday, Cambridge re-published its Report and Support website but the list of “micro-aggressions” had been taken down, as had its definition of racism. The website says that students and staff can make “named reports” about inappropriate behaviour of others but explained that the anonymous reporting option is now under review. It explained that a working group has been convened to decide on the future of this aspect of the site. In December, academics prevailed after voting down an attempt by university chiefs to force them to be “respectful of the erse identities of others”.Three amendments, put forward by academics who said they wanted to safeguard free speech at the 800-year-old university, were voted through, leading the rebel dons to claim they had “won by a landslide”.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"left rabid dog life like ordinary belarusians trapped country","story":"Europe and Britain have moved to ban flights to and from Belarus to punish Alexander Lukashenko for effectively hijacking a Ryanair flight in order to arrest a dissident journalist. But many Belarusians who oppose Mr Lukashenko and have suffered under his rule fear they are about to become even more isolated. Maxim, a 33-year-old artist currently living at an artists residence in Vienna, was due to fly back home to Minsk next month but now is not sure how he would get back.“Minsk airport used to be the only way to get out of the country,” said Maxim, a 33-year old artist who was meant to fly back to Minsk after completing a residency in Vienna next month. “The EU ban for Belavia is a direct blow against ordinary people and civil society. They have isolated and left us with a rabid dog,” he said, referring to the president of 26 years. The regime doesn’t give a damn about Belavia because they have been slapped with visa bans as it is.”In a list of sanctions announced on Tuesday, the European Council called on member states to close their airspace and airports to Belarusian carriers, and stop their own airlines from flying to or over Belarus. Latvia and Poland (along with non-EU members Britain and Ukraine) have already banned their own airlines from flying to and from Belarus, resulting in cancelled flights to Warsaw and Riga. The measures have been welcomed by Belarusian opposition leaders including Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled former presidential  candidate who many Belarusians believe was the legitimate winner of August\u0027s election. Speaking to the European Parliament on Thursday, she urged MEPs to stick to the proposed sanctions and not be tempted to return to a softly-softly policy. “The EU approach of gradually elevating pressure on the Lukashenko regime hasn\u0027t managed to change its behaviour and only led to a growing sense of impunity and massive repressions,“ she said. But many ordinary Belarusians, including those sympathetic to the opposition, have expressed dismay. The Belarusian government imposed stiff restrictions on crossing the country’s land borders citing fears of Covid-19 that Mr Lukashenko otherwise routinely dismisses as insignificant, making it almost impossible to drive or take the train into neighbouring Poland and Lithuania. And the recent arrests of several Belarusian dissidents in Russia, which has a visa free regime with Belarus and has previously served as an escape route for opponents of Mr Lukashenko, has also left many wary of travelling via Moscow. Many fleeing Mr Lukashenko’s brutal crackdown on the opposition have in recent months taken the short flight to Warsaw or Vilnius instead, and they now fear that door closing.“People on both sides of the border found themselves in a cage,” said Volha Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova, 28, who moved to Poland with her family in March.Everyone opposed to the Lukashenko regime “has been waiting for harsh sanctions for so long: But now that it happened, the sanctions are not really against the regime but against ordinary people,” she said. Ms Neskladovskaya-Tereshkova is typical of thousands of opposition-leaning Belarusians who have sought refuge in Europe following the terrifying and indiscriminate crackdown Mr Lukashenko unleashed after a disputed elections in August. Her husband, an IT specialist, was grabbed by riot police at an election-night protest and was repeatedly beaten and humiliated in custody before he was released three days later. Investigators declined to open a criminal probe when he complained about the beatings. The couple and their toddler left the country when secured a Polish work visa. Now, she says, she has no idea when she will next see her parents. She’s also not sure what to do about the family corgi, which is still in Minsk and which her brother was meant to bring to Warsaw in the coming weeks. “We’d probably have to do it via Russia but it’s not easy flying with a dog.”“It feels like a trap.  Land borders are closed and now planes won’t fly. In the past, if you were in danger, you could relocate to Poland or Lithuania, and the flights were cheap, fast and open to us, said  Marina Sokolova, a 46-year old freelance journalist in Minsk. Nonetheless, she insisted she could see the point of the sanctions and said she could bear them - provided all these steps contribute to change in Belarus.I’m a journalist and many of my friends are now in prison and what are our inconveniences caused by the ban in comparison to their suffering in prison. It is a double edged sword. We are trapped but we understand that this is one step to our freedom,” she said.  The anger is also spilling onto social media, with many wondering how isolation will harm the regime. Talks around passenger flights tofrom Belarus are a celebration of human indifference, Andrey Vozyanov, a Minsk based musician, wrote on Facebook. Belarusians whom I know had long feared of being sealed off, but few expected it coming from outside.European diplomats are certainly aware of the issue. German officials raised the possible impact on members of the Belarusian opposition trying to get out of the country during the talks that led up to Tuesday\u0027s statement on sanctions. And a French proposal to sever all land transportation links with Belarus was shot down by other nations who considered it too drastic and likely to hurt ordinary people. The full closure of EU airports to Belavia, the national carrier most Belarusian travellers rely on, will only come into effect after ministers and bureaucrats hammer out the legal details, which could take weeks. Minsk airport continued to schedule Belavia flights to and from EU destinations including  Amsterdam, Milan, Tallin, Vienna and Warsaw remained scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday. Flights will continue to Russia and most other former Soviet states remain unaffected, as well as major non-European hubs including Istanbul. Belavia currently flies non-stop from London Gatwick to Minsk three times weekly on an Embraer 195. A total of 13 flights from London to Minsk (one way) are scheduled to depart in June 2021, according to Cirium, a company that collates aviation industry data. Andrei Sannikov, a former presidential candidate and opposition leader who fled Belarus after being beaten and jailed in 2011, said concerns about the consequences for ordinary people were legitimate. But he argued that the measures were necessary and marked a long overdue recognition that more than two decades of trying to engage with Mr Lukashenko\u0027s regime had failed. “Yes I am worried about the impact on ordinary people, but I have not heard anyone really complaining about it so far. When I speak to people, they generally say they are willing to endure a little pain if they can finally get rid of this psychopath,” he said by telephone from Warsaw, where he now lives. The main thing is that Europe has finally realised Lukashenko is a threat to everyone. They previously tried to treat Belarus as a humanitarian issue, not as a security issue, and that did not work, he said. Ms Neskladovskaya is not so sure. “Europe wants to ensure safety for its own citizens: but who’s going to ensure our safety? she said. People got shut out and they have no idea how to get out of the country if they need to.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mad herd immunity ever taboo phrase","story":"Just like gravity, herd immunity is a scientific fact. To the shock of many infectious disease epidemiologists, politicians, some media, and scientists turned it into a dirty word. Some talked about a ‘herd immunity strategy,’ but every strategy leads to herd immunity, so that is as nonsensical as pilots using a ‘gravity strategy’ to land a plane. The plane will reach the ground no matter what the key is to land safely. In the Commons,  health secretary Matt Hancock tragically claimed that focused protection of the old was impossible and that “herd immunity cannot be reached”. In The Lancet, a group of scientists argued against a ‘so-called herd immunity approach’, falsely asserting that ‘there is no evidence for lasting protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection.’ This is contrary to the scientific evidence, as there is evidence of long-lasting immunity for recovered COVID patients. Jeremy Corbyn described a “herd immunity strategy” as a form of “eugenics,” displaying a profound lack of understanding of both concepts.Boris Johnson’s former advisor, Dominic Cummings, denounced the UKs delay in initiating lockdowns as motivated by “herd immunity.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock backbenchers flock health secretarys aid spartacus","story":"On Wednesday, Dominic Cummings described his work-day from hell: Covid cases surging, emergency COBRA meetings derailed by begging requests to join Trump’s bombing campaign of Iraq – and most shocking of all - Number 10’s media operation going into meltdown over the reputation of a Jack Russell.Most of us would be hard-pushed to imagine so awful a day – but then again, most of us aren’t Matt Hancock. Given the epic monstering he endured at Cummings’s hands on Wednesday, it was almost a surprise to see him still standing in the Commons, bloodied but unbowed.Caught in the crosshairs, he attempted a Churchillian call to arms – though this being Matt, it was overlaid with trademark Hancockian schmaltz. He heaped praise on Our NHS and warmly thanked the “volunteers who stood in cold car parks with a smile”.“We have come together, and we have overcome!”, he finished, flopping back dramatically on the green benches.Jonathan Ashworth, Hancock’s mild-mannered opposite number, usually seems a bit too polite for the Westminster swamp. Today, even he came out keen to slash and burn – though with his cherubic features and reedy voice, the effect was underwhelming, like watching your pet hamster attempting a powerplay to commandeer the seedbox.“Is he ashamed that he promised a protective shield around care homes, and over 30,000 care home residents have died?”, piped Ashworth solemnly.The Health Secretary looked cowed. Any minute now his bottom lip was going to wobble. But suddenly reinforcements arrived in the reassuring form of Jeremy Hunt – former health secretary, select committee chair and classic Head Boy material. Like a protective older brother, he defended poor Matt from the sixth-form bully who’d stolen his dinner money and spread nasty stories about him in the locker-room.The Tory faithful whinnied approvingly, but it was not over yet.Martyn Day of the SNP demanded a full and immediate public inquiry, Yasmin Qureshi asked about corporate manslaughter and Munira Wilson doubled down on care home deaths. Legions of opposition MPs surrounded the Health Secretary, drawn to the Cummings standard.Then, following Jeremy Hunt’s lead, the Tory backbenchers linked arms and formed a defensive phalanx around him. One by one, they stood up, in a blue-rosetted version of Spartacus, demonstrating their solidarity in ever-more sycophantic ways.“When it comes to the Health Secretary, I’m a fan”, said Mark Logan, quoting an approving constituent and plugging an article he had written in the Secretary of State\u0027s defence.“Yeahyeahyeah!” snarled the Tory combatants.Much of the love-bombing emanated from the West Country. Selaine Saxby thanked him for visiting North Devon district hospital and condemned the ‘flip-flopping’ opposition. Cherilyn Mackrory went one further, not just celebrating his trip to the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro but posing a hardball question: “Can my right honourable friend assure me that he will ignore unsubstantiated Westminster gossip, and stay focused on delivering the vaccination rollout?”“I’m Matt Hancock!” “I’m Matt Hancock!” they cried.It resembled siege warfare. The Opposition trebuchet would lob a few Cummings projectiles at the keep. Meanwhile Matt or one of his backbenchers would retaliate with missiles of their own, usually praise for the vaccination rollout, or use of the word ’unprecedented’, which was deployed in unprecedented quantities, even for these unprecedented times.The congenial back-slapping atmosphere occasionally intensified into heavy-petting, but Matt swelled and his confidence blossomed.At the evening press conference later, the transparency-loving Health Secretary swerved queries about care home deaths with a familiar tactic repeating the same waffling platitudes until it was time for the next question.“Every day we are unwavering in our focus to protect life”, he trilled, on auto-pilot, using phrases only a character in a Steven Spielberg film – or a Minister who knows he’s lived to fight another day – would be bold enough to articulate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mediterranean caribbean islands front race join green list","story":"A small band of Mediterranean, Atlantic and Caribbean islands could make it onto the Government’s green list for quarantine free holidays, according to two independent analyses.Robert Boyle, a former BA strategist who correctly forecast a handful of countries last time, suggests just Malta, Finland, Slovakia and some Spanish and Greek islands will join the green list for take-off on June 7.Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, who also correctly identified contenders last time, suggests Malta, Grenada, Finland, the Canary Islands, Balearics, Barbados and Jamaica should all be added to the green list.Both have sought to emulate the analysis prepared for ministers by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which provides a risk assessment on countries based on their infection rates, the prevalence of variants, their testing and genome sequencing capacity and vaccination levels.Both agree that the major European destinations of Spain, Greece, Italy and France are unlikely to make the cut on June 7 for the green list, which allows holidaymakers to return without having to quarantine, although they still have to pay for PCR tests.Only Portugal and Gibraltar in Europe are currently on the list, which currently includes 12 countries and territories such as Israel and Iceland.However, Spain, Italy, Greece and Croatia have opened their borders to British holidaymakers despite the countries being on the UK\u0027s amber list, thus requiring travellers to quarantine for 10 days on their return.Mr Boyle said seven other countries could be classified green if the EU threshold for case rates of 75 per 100,000 was used instead of the UK Government\u0027s more stringent measures. Five of these are in the EU: Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy and Luxembourg.The other two are Russia, which would be unlikely to be included for political reasons, and the United States, which has similar infection rates to Portugal and some of the highest vaccination levels in the world.Putting the US on the green list would be massive news, but with the Government under fire for failing to put India on the red list early enough, I suspect they’ll want to be seen to be taking a cautious line, said Mr Boyle.So the US is likely to just miss the cut this time round. But I do think it will be hard to find rational grounds to exclude it at the following review point later in June, unless variants of concern provide the excuse.On the down side, his assessment suggested Bahrain, Costa Rica, Trinidad and Tobago and Kuwait could be added to the red list, banning foreign travel and requiring returning Britons to quarantine in a Government approved hotel for ten days at a cost of £1,750.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, has said the Government will look at the possibility of opening up to islands like the Balearics, Canaries and those in Greece with direct flights from the UK, even if infection rates prevent mainland Spain and Greece being added to the green list.Mr Charles said analysis of the rates suggested they should be green, but there may be other considerations such as the impact on UK borders where officers have to check all returning passengers. Before the pandemic five million Britons travelled to the Balearics each year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"might soon live 150 good thing","story":"“Immortality dashed,” announced the headline in this newspaper, “but humans could live to be 150.” It says something about the unrealistic expectations of the modern human that living for one and a half centuries should be presented as something of an anti-climax.For years now there have been rumours that scientists, funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, were on the brink of solving death altogether. But a large-scale study of elderly volunteers in America and the UK has concluded that even the best-maintained body is doomed to “progressive functional decline”. Our biological resilience cannot extend beyond 120-150 years: “the absolute limit of the human life”.Still – 150 years. That sounds good to me. Enough time to really get stuck in, but with a distant deadline to concentrate the mind. Like doing a PhD in life, instead of bluffing your way through the GCSE.Although the average global life has already more than doubled – from 47 in 1950, to 73 today – it’s still a struggle to fit everything in. In fact, living longer has made us more slow-moving, particularly when it comes to the big decisions: leaving the parental home, finding a long-term mate, becoming parents ourselves.I was 36 when I had the first of my three children, almost 14 years ago. If I were a global statistic from 1950, I’d be dead already. As it is, I sometimes find myself staring at the ceiling in the insomniac hours, calculating all the things I may miss out on because of this late start.If my children reproduce as sluggishly as me, and if I die in my seventies, like my father, I may never get to meet any of my grandchildren.It’s not the babies per se that I feel sad about it’s the thought that I won’t be able to accompany my children on this part of their adventure.There are, it must be admitted, obvious drawbacks to extending our lifes. The chances are we wouldn’t get much in the way of extra youth. By far the bulk of our additional years would be spent in a condition of extreme senectitude. What’s the point of meeting your descendants if you can only wave at them wanly from your pickling vat?It would be awful for the planet, too. John K Davis, an American philosophy professor, has run demographic models to see what extending our lives to 150 would do to the world. His research found that, even if the birth rate was limited to two children per woman, the global population would reach 21 billion by the end of this century: 10 billion more than currently projected. Mass famine, on the heels of climate disaster, would surely follow.For the sake of our grandchildren, then, we should not strive to meet them. But how can we resist? Life really does feel so short as it is.American pharmacists are reporting a surge in sales of teeth-whitener, as the country prepares to relax its guidance on mask-wearing. Make-up, party clothes, deodorant and hair-removal cream are also booming.What a bore! The one enjoyable aspect of this pandemic has been allowing myself to go entirely to seed. I haven’t worn make-up, put on high heels or even weighed myself for over a year. My body is so hairy I hardly need clothes to stay warm.I could happily stay like this – fat, furry and comfortable – forever.

The poll has it well short of a majority, and all the other parties have ruled out going into coalition with it.Instead a rival coalition is likely form around the CDU in order to keep the far-Right party out of power.Reiner Haseloff, the regional CDU leader, has made it clear any form of cooperation with the AfD is a “red line” the party will not cross.“The AfD has no coalition partners, and cannot govern without them and against the CDU,” Hermann Binkert, the head of Insa, said.There was good news for the Green Party, which is set to more than double its vote from 2016 in Saxony-Anhalt, according to the Insa poll, which had it in fourth place on 11 per cent.The party has traditionally struggled in the former communist east, and a good result would be seen as evidence it can now compete in every region of Germany. The Greens briefly led the national polls this month, but they have slipped back to second, on 22 per cent behind the CDU on 26 percent.The AfD is currently in fifth place nationally on 11 per cent, short of the 12.5 per cent the party won in 2017’s general election.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock makes inaccurate claim","story":"NewsMatt Hancock makes inaccurate claim immediately after vowing to be straight with UKThe Tory Health Secretary gave incorrect data to Parliament on Boltons vaccination rate, a few minutes after he had vocerously denied Dominic Cummings claims that he is a liarmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-says-people-bolton-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:kkmKY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Health Secretary made the unfortunate exaggeration in Parliament, where minutes earlier he had denied claims from Dominic Cummings that he lied on multiple occasions.He told Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi, whose town of Bolton has been badly hit by the Indian Covid iant: The number of vaccinations happening in Bolton right now is phenomenal, tens of thousands every single day.And it is heartening to see the queues of people coming forward. While the number of jabs in Bolton has indeed soared - roughly quadrupling since the start of May - it is still nowhere near tens of thousands per day in a town of ,. Government data shows that in the last week, the -day rolling average was around a peak of , first doses and , per day, a total of , to , per day. There have been some successful single days, but at , first doses on May  and , second doses on May . Bolton South East MP Ms Qureshi had asked when the Prime Minister and others would be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter  She spoke after ex-No aide Mr Cummings said tens of thousands of people died who did not need to die in the UK Covid pandemic. She told the Commons: Last week my constituents were wrongly accused of vaccine hesitancy and then we had a quasi-lockdown that no-one knew about and many peopleaposs travel plans were thrown in chaos. My constituents can forgive the Government for that, but I am sure that I speak for the country when I say that we cannot forgive tens of thousands of people who died and didnapost need to die - the chilling words of Dominic Cummings. Will the Secretary of State tell me, when will the Prime Minister and others be investigated by the police for alleged corporate manslaughter and why did we not follow the example of New Zealand where they managed to control it with a minimum number of deaths  Health Secretary Matt Hancock replied: No, but what I would say to the people of Bolton is that - the people of Bolton have again risen to this challenge. Asked about the discrepancy, Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman said: The data for vaccination rates in Bolton and other areas is published on our dashboard very clearly. And it is right that Bolton is well above the average numbers of vaccinations being carried out daily, which is a testament to the work by the local NHS and the public in Bolton. AskedMr Hancock had misled MPs, the spokesman replied: I haven’t seen the Health Secretary’s comment. What I would point you to is the data published on the dashboard. It does highlight the huge numbers of vaccinations that are being carried out in Bolton. That’s a real success of the surge vaccination programme introduced by the Department of Health and Social Care. Earlier Mr Hancock denied explosive allegations from Dominic Cummings - insisting: Iaposve been straight with people - but did not go into details about his claims.The PMaposs former aide said Mr Hancock should have been sacked on  to  occasions in a bombshell evidence session before MPs on Wednesday. He accused Mr Hancock of lying in meetings and in public, as well as interfering in the rollout of the Test and Trace scheme to meet a stupid testing target. In one of his most serious allegations, Mr Cummings also blamed Mr Hancock for the failure to test patients ing to care homes in the early stages of the pandemic. He said Mr Hancock had insisted people were being tested before going into care homes, only for the PM to find out weeks later that they were not. Mr Hancock told MPs: These... are serious allegations and I welcome the opportunity to come to the House to put formally on the record that these unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true. Iaposve been straight with people in public and in private throughout.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNHSHouse of CommonsBoris JohnsonCare homesNursing homesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak denies david cameron","story":"NewsRishi Sunak denies David Cameron got special attention as row erupts over lost textsTop treasury official Sir Tom Scholar refused to allow texts he sent to the David Cameron to be handed over to the Treasury Select Committee, which scrutinises the work of Mr Sunak’s departmentmirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video mps-question-rishi-sunak-over-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:pNntqcqz,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeRishi Sunak claimed David Cameron was not given any special attention from the Treasury, despite dozens of cosy chats and messages between him and senior officials and ministers. The Chancellor claimed his department’s contact with the former PM did “not occupy a lot of our overall time”, and that “it was important to look at this regardless of who was raising it with us.” MPs were left gobsmacked as Mr Sunak complained that having to declare details of lobbyists’ contact with officials might mean firms are less likely to engage with government. And a fresh row emerged over the publication of texts from a top Treasury official to former PM David Cameron as he lobbied officials on behalf of a doomed lender. Top treasury official Sir Tom Scholar refused to allow texts he sent to the David Cameron to be handed over to the Treasury Select Committee, which scrutinises the work of Mr Sunak’s department. Mr Cameron contacted Sir Tom, pleading in vain for the Government to prop up financier Greensill Capital as the Covid- pandemic took hold. Mr Cameron released his side of the chummy conversation - which he signed off Love DC. But the Treasury said Sir Tomaposs replies had been wiped, after his password was entered incorrectly on his official phone. In one of Mr Cameron’s messages to Sir Tom on March , the former PM appeared to predict a Bank of England interest rate cut five days before it was announced.  Mr Cameron wrote: “Never quite understood how rate cuts help a pandemic. Officials are legally barred from disclosing market sensitive information about changes to interest rates. Mr Cameron claimed he had been talking about an already announced VAT rate cut. And speaking to the Committee today, Sir Tom said he could not remember the subject of the discussion, but suggested it might have been to do with an emergency rate cut in the United States. But askedhe would allow Mr Cameron to provide his copy of his messages to the Committee, he refused - saying any release of the information should be controlled by the Treasury through Freedom of Information disclosures. Such disclosure could take weeks, and would allow the Treasury to redact the messages before they were released to the public. The messages that we were talking about were generated by me in on an official government device in the course of official government business, Sir Tom said. And I think itaposs appropriate that that be treated like any other part of official government business, and disclosure would have been governed through the Freedom of Information act. Sir Tom told the Committee his phone gets accidentally wiped about once a year, adding: It tends to happen after the password has been changed, which youaposre required to do at regular intervals. Both Treasury officials and Mr Sunak claimed Mr Cameron’s lobbying had been unsuccessful, and had not taken up much time. Charles Roxburgh, second permanent secretary to the Treasury, defended the Treasury’s nine meetings with the firm’s representatives. He told the Committee Mr Sunak “did not spend a lot of time on this, and I did not spend a lot of time on this, because I too was working on a lot more time-consuming and intense situations at the time, Mr Roxburgh met several times with Greensill at a time when the Government was scrambling to respond to the Covid- pandemic. After a few meetings the Treasury declined Greensillaposs attempts to be part of the Bank of Englandaposs Covid Corporate Financing Facilityscheme. Mr Sunak claimed increasing transparency on Government lobbying would make firms “reluctant” to engage with ministers, which he said would be “disappointing and damaging to the policymaking process. “If they feel that every communication with government is available to the public, they might be reluctant to engage,” he said.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDavid CameronThe TreasuryBank of EnglandBanksCivil servantsInterest ratesPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"uk covid infections highest 6","story":"NewsUK Covid infections at highest for  weeks with up to % caused by Indian iantEarlier on Thursday Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around one in  people in hospital with Covid- in current \"hotspots\" have had both vaccines, but the vast majority have not which \"gives us a high degree of confidence that the vaccine is highly effective.\"mirrorShareCommentsByJane KirbyMilo BoydReporterDan Bloom:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-more-half-big-,customFields:,clearance:Network,source:bcdccbccd,sourceUrl:sky news,site:Mirror,brandSafety: Sport and specialist news – passed for ad targeting,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:teYcYkZh,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Matt Hancock announced this afternoon that the Indian iant was still spreading, with between half and three quarters of new cases now the mutant strain.The rising figures were reported the day after the Health Secretary told MPs that on Wednesday there were , new cases of coronavirus, which is the highest since April .While this is unwelcome news, a graph of coronavirus cases shown during the briefing exposes only a slight recent rise in daily cases. Moreover, Hancock yesterday said that the link between Covid- cases, hospital admissions and deaths is being severed, in large part due to the vaccination programme. On May  there were  people in hospital with Covid, while there were around , admissions every day in January.  The Health Secretary told MPs this pandemic isnapost over yet, adding: Our vaccination programme has reached  per cent of the adult population, but that means that more than a quarter still havenapost been jabbed...  per cent of adults have had both jabs, but that means that more than half are yet to get the fullest possible protection that two jabs gives. Yesterday we saw , new cases of coronavirus, the highest since April , but thanks to the power of vaccination, in which I have always believed, the link from cases to hospitalisations and to deaths is being severed. It was reported yesterday that the iant - B... - was detected in  local authorities in the week ending  May. That is an  per cent weekly increase, according to figures from the Wellcome Sanger Institute which sequences a random sample of positive tests in the community. Scientists do not believe the Indian iant is more deadly or renders the vaccine less effective. However, government advisory body SAGE believes there is a realistic possibility transmissibility could be  per cent higher.  The latest data come after Professor Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, whose modelling was instrumental to the UK locking down in March , said the Indian iant was now the dominant strain in the UK and the full reopening of society on June  hangs in the balance.Asked in the Commons by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt what measures could be taken to ensure June  - when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted - could go ahead, Mr Hancock said: It is true that the Indian iant is spreading across the country, and estimates y as to what proportion of the new cases each day are the iant first identied in India, which is more transmissible. Now my assessment is that it is too early now to say, yet, whether we can take the full step four on June . Like him, I desperately want us to, but we will only do thatitaposs safe. We will make a formal assessment ahead of June  as to what step we can take onthe st, and in that we will be both driven by the data, we will be advised on and guided by the science, and we will be fully transparent both with this House and with the public in those decisions.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnImperial CollegeJeremy HuntHospitalsCoronavirusMatthew Hancock MP"},{"url":null,"title":"extreme period mood swings mean","story":"NewsExtreme period mood swings mean I despise we and kids - and cant stand my son talkingTerri Bailey, from Worthing, West Sussex, suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder , a condition that changes her personality completely in the lead up to her periodmirrorShare, a condition that changes her personality completely in the lead up to her period\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Terri-Bailey.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\", a condition that changes her personality completely in the lead up to her period\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Terri-Bailey.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\", a condition that changes her personality completely in the lead up to her period\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _Terri-Bailey.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\"CommentsByHana CarterZoe ForseyFeatures Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsTerri Bailey with her beautul family \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She loves nothing more than family time, especially days on the beach with her we Rachel and their children Ezra, four, and -month-old Freya. But for the other half of other month, Terri feels like a dferent person. The -year-old, from Worthing, West Sussex, suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder , which means the run-up to her period sees her personality drastically change as she becomes consumed by extreme anxiety, depression, and feelings of uncontrollable rage. She admits the condition means she struggled the sound of her young sonaposs constant talking.  She tells the Mirror: “PMDD turns me into a whole other version of myself. For half of the month Iaposm so happy, in control, and rational. Iaposm a good we, mother and friend. “And then I ovulate and itaposs like I get a second personality. I am me, and then Iaposm not me.” While most women suffer period pains, mood swings and heightened emotions during their monthly cycle, PMDD is very dferent and more extreme. It affects one in  women worldwide and is often categorised as extreme premenstrual tension . Many sufferers say their symptoms begin during the ovulation stage of their cycle - which is typically around  to  days before bleeding. Itaposs like my personality fades, I am full of anger, anxiety, depression, and paranoia. Iaposm crippled by fatigue and constantly experiencing hot flushes,” Terri explained. “I struggle to cope with the sound of my son talking non-stop. Or the sound of music on the radio. I get so easily overwhelmed and forgetful. I struggle to connect with my role as a mother, and as a partner. I feel attacked and often withdrawn. At its worst, the thoughts have been so hard to handle.”  Terriaposs debilitating disorder first reared its head after the birth of her son, Ezra, in . But the path to diagnosis and getting help for her condition has been an uphill battle for Terri, who says she’s found it hard to be taken seriously. “The GP tried to label it as postpartum depression because it started when my son was a baby. Then it was suggested that it was early menopause,” she explained. “I think it comes down to lack of knowledge, PMDD seems to be misunderstood across the board. Often I’ll hear ‘it’s just what all women go through’. “But it’s all cyclical, and that’s the defining thing about PMDD. Doctors just don’t seem to understand that I’m fine for one half of the month and not fine for the other half,” she said.  After being taunted by suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts about her children harming themselves or her we being killed, she felt she had no other option but to seek private healthcare and in  she was finally given a diagnosis. “During one bad cycle, my brain was telling me that my baby girl was falling off the bed around ten times a night. Iaposd jump up in the startle reflex, sweating, cortisol soaring, searching the floor in the dark looking for my baby to comfort. Iaposd hear the thud of her falling, over and over. But she wasnapost even in the same room. She was safe and asleep in her cot.” Her we Rachel went out for a run at night and Terri’s crippling paranoia convinced her that Rachel had been murdered. “My brain literally played the most catastrophic realities like a film in my head. I imagined her death, her funeral, the bit where I tell our children she isnapost coming back. I was hit by this unimaginable grief for something that wasnapost even real. I stood on the doorstep in the cold, waiting for her to come home. The second I saw her I began hyperventilating and that led to a panic attack.”Teri, , shares snippets of her le on her colourful Instagram grid, sharing pictures of her grinning children enjoying days at the beach and snaps of loving embraces between her and Rachel.But in between the cheerful squares, she opens up with followers about her battle in a bid to help other women with the condition.  She said: “People with PMDD don’t just get a bit tearful, our world is dark and everyone is out to get us. We’re not just a bit irritable premenstrually, we’re full of misplaced and uncontrollable rage. “We don’t just feel down in the dumps, it’s an anxiety so intense that it’s a struggle to face the day, and a depression so heavy it feels like a mental illness.” “These things happen only after I ovulate. And then the emotional, physical, and psychological unrest resolves every time I come on my period and enter the follicular phase again. She has stressed that she has done everything in her power to make it better - including following a strict low GI diet, exercising, taking contraceptives and supplements but nothing has saved her from the crippling effects of her condition. The mum-of-two is currently taking SSRIs and has been on a waiting list for four months for an appointment with a gynaecologist to explore the route of medical menopause so her cycles are forced to stop completely. “It’s often misdiagnosed, or undiagnosed, and yet so often dictating and ruining young, healthy womenaposs mental and physical wellbeing,” she said “I have half a month to live a full le. I have two small children who I love and want to mother well, and PMDD is constantly challenging that. Iaposm  and should be in the prime of my le. Enjoying my family.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMental healthPanic attacksMenopausePeriods"},{"url":null,"title":"centre young offenders were brutally","story":"NewsCentre where young offenders were brutally abused to detain women seeking asylumPriti Patel’s cruel plan for the Medomsley Detention Centre in Country Durham opens a new chapter of suffering after a brutal double betrayal as surivivors of abuse want to see the buidings town down and refugee campaigners were promised a new approach to womens detentionmirrorShareCommentsByRos Wynne JonesReal Britain columnistMaryam Qaiser:,  MAY NewsDavid Alan Brown was violently abused at Medomsley Detention Centre in  \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Its ­red-brick buildings are haunted by its brutal past as an experiment in Margaret Thatcher’s “short, sharp shock”. For decades, the facility for young, first-time offenders, was the scene of brutal, sadistic detention, where  to -year-olds were sexually and physically abused – for which members of staff were eventually convicted. Now, Home Secretary Priti Patel has a new plan for the abandoned buildings near Consett, County Durham. A “prison-style” detention and “removal centre” for up to  women seeking asylum. The news comes as a blow to Medomsley’s survivors who want to see the buildings torn down. It is also a betrayal of refugee campaigners promised a new approach to women’s detention, at a time when concerns are growing over Home Office failures at Napier and Penally Barracks. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Medomsley survivor David ‘Alan’ Brown says he was sent there in  aged  for a petty crime he didn’t commit. Now a -year-old grandad, he waived his anonymity in  to give evidence against his abusers. This week, we introduced Alan to Agnes Tanoh, a refugee who is campaigning against the centre. “It is a shock, because in my opinion that place needs to be knocked down,” Alan told Agnes. “There are too many bad memories in that bad place. When I drive past or see or hear the word Medomsley, it makes me feel ill. I want to drive a crane with a big ball on the end and smash it to bits.” He shares his memories, which include being “kicked to bits” in a padded cell, “hearing bones crunch” during beatings handed out to other boys, and one boy asking him to stamp on his leg to break it, to escape a brutal PT session. Agnes, who once worked for the Ivorian MP Simone Gbagbo, we of the former president, narrowly escaped the Ivory Coast with her le in . A year earlier she was among those locked up with Mr and Mrs Gbagbo when rival politician Alassane ­Ouattara seized power following a contested election. More than , people were killed in fighting, including many of Agnes’ close friends. She was freed from prison by the UN, walked to Ghana, and fled to the UK to seek sanctuary. “I came here to save my le,” she tells Alan. “I knew the UK. I’d visited as a diplomat and sent my children to study here.” But when she asked for help, she ended up in the notorious Yarl’s Wood Detention Centre near Bedford.Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters “It was so painful to be in prison again. I was taken three times to the airport to be deported. I thought death was waiting for me at the other side. I was so ­frightened, I tried to trust in God. “I finally have refugee status and am believed, after eight years repeating the same story. Why was I locked up  I still live with the stigma and pain.” At , Alan was beaten every day by Christopher Onslow, a PT instructor. He was punched in the mouth by another officer, John McGee. He knew others were being sexually abused. “They were watching us in the showers, there was something sick about the whole place,” he says. “Onslow was an animal. The weak lads, you could hear the crunch, he was hitting them so hard. It was a pure nightmare.”  Niamh Wilson of Hampson Hughes Solicitors, which represents survivors, adds: “It is shocking that these plans are even being considered. “We’ve worked with over  victims who suffered unimaginable physical and sexual abuse at Medomsley ­Detention Centre – the idea of the site being used again to imprison ­vulnerable people is appalling. I know victims we have supported agree the building needs to be torn down, not used for a further chapter of suffering.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Immigration detention plays a crucial role in a robust immigration system and a signicant proportion of women detained are facing deportation because of criminal offences.  “The immigration removal estate is under ongoing review to ensure the Home Office has sufficient resilience, geographical footprint and capacity for the men and women it is necessary to detain for the purposes of removal, while providing value for money.” The facility at Medomsley later became Hassockfield Secure Training Centre, which closed in . It took until  for Alan to get justice. “I told the court, don’t feel sorry for these little old men – in  they were animals,” he says. “Onslow got eight-and-a-half years. I felt asI had lost eight stone getting that out of us.” Onslow, then , was found guilty of assault and wounding with intent while McGee, then , was jailed for two years and eight months for assault and misconduct in a public office. Agnes is visibly upset. “What I went through, I don’t want to happen to others who just want protection,” she says. “When they harm one lady, they harm a family, ­children. I will campaign until someone hears our cry.” Alan nods. “Fighting the ­Government is one of the hardest things you can do. They don’t listen to people like you and me. They don’t care about people like us. It took me years to get even with these people. “Never give up. Never. If you give up, they get away with it.”To sign Agnes’ petition, visit change.org and search for “women detention centre”Additional reporting Maryam QaiserFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPriti PatelHome OfficePrisonsCrimePoliticsImmigrationAsylum SeekersChild abuse"},{"url":null,"title":"couple transform run down caravan","story":"NewsCouple transform run-down caravan into dream riverside getaway for less than £,It took Nicola Harris and her husband Mark just four weekends to refit the static camper – and theyve turned it into a lavish lockdown-proof getaway for less than £,mirrorShareCommentsByRia NewmanLaurie Churchman:,  MAY NewsNicola Harris and her husband Mark spent £, transforming a caravan into an ideal holiday home \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Nicola Harris, , fell in love with the lush river views when she visited her brother in Shillingford-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, earlier this year. She and her husband Mark, , decided to buy a static caravan – and then spent under £, turning it into a dream getaway. Half the cost went towards flooring, new blinds and a plush sofa. The caravan looked a little tired when they bought it for £, earlier this year. But with just a few daysapos work, they have given the place a complete refit. Nicola said: “It was really dated, in good condition and quite clean but the décor wasn’t me at all. “I wanted a ‘fixer upper’, something I could really put my mark on. To turn the caravan into a stylish home, the couple took out the fitted sofas and side units in the living room - and then painted all the interior walls and units in the kitchen, bathroom and living room. They also removed the curtains and nets from the windows and replaced them with made-to-measure venetian blinds – and it cost just over £ for the whole van. Nicola and Mark also used stick-on metro tiles to give the kitchen and bathroom a fresher look. They scoured bargain home stores for accessories, getting their hands on lamps, mirrors and fake plants. It took just four weekends to complete the renovation. Nicola says removing the carpet was the worst job. She said: “Apparently they carpet caravans, then add the fitted furniture – so wardrobes, sofas, and even the shower cubicle had the pink carpet underneath. “I was still pulling up carpet at midnight the Sunday evening before the flooring was laid. I could have cried that night!” A local company installed the herringbone vinyl for the floor, which changed the feel of the caravan instantly, but the couple did the rest. Nicola added: “After the flooring was done, I loved seeing each room transformed with just a coat of paint and a few accessories. “I love it – every time I walk in, I smile – it’s such a lovely place to be. “I’m really looking forward to creating wonderful memories down the van with friends and family, especially now we can start socialising again.” The van is just  minutes away from the coupleaposs Oxfordshire home. They said it was important for the family to have a nearby vacation spot as lockdown restrictions ease. Nicola said: “With overseas travel restrictions still in place who knows when we will be able to travel freely again. “We have a two-week holiday booked to the Dominican in July but I’m pretty certain it will be cancelled so we will spend at least one, possibly two, of those weeks here at the van. “The caravan will also be nice for my grown-up children to use with their friends for a getaway, as we have all had holidays cancelled over the last  months. “With the van being right on the river, it really does have a holiday vibe to it.“Although we can’t guarantee the weather in England, when the sun does shine thereaposs no better place to be.She added: Itaposs made me look more at holidaying in England in the future, rather than feeling I always have to jet off somewhere for a break.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDream Homes"},{"url":null,"title":"covid infections surge more half","story":"NewsCovid infections surge in more than half of England as Indian iant becomes dominantThe rising coronavirus case numbers have been released on the day that Matt Hancock said the Indian iant now account for up to three quarters of new infectionsmirrorShareCommentsByIan JonesMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video matt-hancock-says-people-bolton-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:kkmKY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The excavation project was sparked after a TV crew reported finding blue material buried in the cellar in Gloucester. It was long suspected Fred West killed the teenager and could have buried her in the basement of the then Pop In cafe in . The -year-old worked at the Pop In café, where Fred was a regular, and her disappearance came at a time when he was abducting, raping and murdering girls and women in Gloucester. But on Thursday Gloucestershire Police announced the dig had been completed and no aposhuman remains or items of signicanceapos had been found.  Police have also said the mystery aposblue materialapos was a burst pipe likely caused by the drilling of the TV production company.The search started after It gained the footage by inserting a camera into a hole their crew had drilled. Assistant Chief Constable Craig Holden said initial imagery detected something blue - but on analysis was most likely detritus or debris from a burst pipe - possibly caused by the drilling. Speaking outside Gloucestershire Constabulary he said: The blue material photographed on an endocope camera by the TV production company was not identied, but we did establish it was likely to be connected to a buried pipe. That pipe [which was not blue] was recovered and excavations went beyond the original endoscope depth. We believe that the drilling may have gone through the pipe and created some sort of detritus or debris, which is what the endoscope picked up.  When we looked, we didnapost see anything blue, so what we believe is that the imagery has given the impression of something blue. Weaposve eliminated that whatever it was that could have been interpreted as blue in that imagery from our investigation. ACC Holden confirmed the cost of the excavation to the taxpayer currently stands at around £, - but could rise to £, or £,. On raising the hopes of Maryaposs family, he said: Itaposs clear to say the family had been contacted by the production company and by the owners of the café. The family were hugely supportive of the work of the production company and I completely understand and accept that the decision made back in  by the then SIO John Bennet and then subsequently the decision that was made the previous chief constable - were reasonable decisions.  The dference here is that new information had come to light that we felt was appropriate to assess. Quite rightly we were approached, new information was provided, that new information predominantly was that there was a blue material in a void within the ground underneath the café. And under careful assessment with our team of investigators and detectives and also nationally accredited experts - we brought those in to assess that information and make a determination as to whether or not there could be a body within that cellar. I believe that the proportionate way that we went about that did take account of whether or not we should search in all areas or some areas. And the guidance and advice from those experts identied the areas that we should be spending more time searching and excavating. Itaposs unfortunate that the initial work that was done through the endoscope and the drilling by the production company couldnapost guarantee that there were no human remains or nothing connected to Maryaposs disappearance. We felt a proportionate excavation was the right, appropriate and proper thing to do. Itaposs absolutely clear that our aim here was to support the family to do everything we possibly could to put Mary to rest on their behalf and I believe that was the right decision. ACC Holden added: Everybody working on this is disappointed that we didnapost find Mary - allowing her family finally to lay her to rest after over  years is absolutely the most important reason for this investigation. Our thoughts are with Maryaposs family, whose continued dignity in recent weeks, and over the many years before, has been absolutely humbling.  Iaposm now confident that Mary is not buried in the cellar of the café, and I hope that eliminating this location will bring some small comfort to her family. We have always been clear that we might not find Maryaposs remains. Sadly, that proved to be the case on this occasion. But it does not mean that we were wrong to look - the new information made it the right thing to do. Serial killer Fred, , committed suicide in prison in  while awaiting trial for  murders.

It was  years since he had last ridden a skateboard – he’d given it up to concentrate on his job as a welder and being a dad to his first child, Jack. But passing a skateboard shop in his hometown of Nottingham, he’d felt the pull of his old hobby. Minutes later, he walked out with a brand new board under his arm. STARTING SLOWLY That was two years ago, and Marc, now , has been brushing up on his skills. “It took me a while to get back into it, but I gradually got there,” he says. “I live opposite a skate park so I could see when it was quiet and I’d time my visits for then. Marc wasn’t sure how his body would stand up to the thrills – and inevitable spills – of the sport: “I started slowly so I didn’t hurt myself, and didn’t attempt anything more complicated than just moving round on the board at first. “I wasn’t too worried about what people thought, though. One of the good things about being older is that you care less about what people think.” As he grew more confident, Marc began to share his hobby with his family.  His -year-old son, Brandon, also had a skateboard, so the pair headed to a Skate Nottingham event, where the coaches taught them tricks and techniques. “Brandon will try stunts that I’m just too cautious to do,” says Marc. “I used to skate ramps, jumping from one and landing on another but it’s too dangerous now. I might crack my head or injure my knee and I’m too old for that. My worst injury has been a rolled ankle.” Marc sticks to street-style skating, where he uses kerbs and rails to skate on. “I taught myself to skate on rails by starting on low walls and then building up,” he explains. “It can take me anything from a week to nearly a year to learn a new trick. It feels great when I can master one that I’ve been working on for ages.” While Marc can skate some impressive rails, he’s still trying to master a basic kick flip, which involves jumping up, flipping the board over and landing on it. Skate Nottingham puts on National Lottery-funded events at skate parks, workshop venues and public spaces around the city, encouraging people of all ages to give it a go. It’s just one of many good causes to have benefited from National Lottery funding, thanks to the £ million raised every week* by players. For Marc it has become a family affair as his stepson, Bill, , joined in and the trio began to explore Nottingham’s skate parks. “We decided to visit as many as possible,” says Marc. “There are such a lot of them now and they’re all really well designed. We started before lockdown but have begun to explore dferent skate parks again now that things are beginning to open up again. And thanks to the support of The National Lottery, many of these parks have the funds to be maintained and improved. Marc started to go to more Skate Nottingham events to show others that you could skateboard regardless of your age. He also began to make friends as he saw the same faces at dferent events. “I didn’t have lots of confidence and I thought I was quite shut off from other people,” says Marc. “But it’s such an inclusive pastime that I began to really feel part of the community.” Meanwhile Marc and the boys began to record the skate parks they visited, and they have ventured further afield. At the last count they had visited around  parks, going as far as Cornwall. “We’re hoping to hit the  mark but we won’t stop there,” says Marc. “It’s become a real family affair too. My elder son, Jack, has started coming along for the ride and to explore new areas, and my -year-old stepdaughter Esme wants to get some roller skates.”  FURTHER BENEFITS As well as bringing them closer as a family, there have been some other benefits too. “It really helped with my mental health over lockdown,” says Marc. “It gave me the space to take some time for myself and unwind. And it’s helped me get to know Bill better. “I’ve also noticed that Brandon is really changing the way he approaches learning new things. In the skate park, he has to stop and assess things logically and I can see that having a positive effect at school too.” How the money you raise is raising smiles In these challenging times it’s great to be able to put a smile on people’s faces. And when you play The National Lottery you’re helping people to do exactly that – whether it’s by bringing the world of the Vikings to le or driving the unique underground train in London’s Postal Museum.  Many of those who have benefited from funding have faced their own le challenges. They include Ekow Otoo, who hasn’t let multiple sclerosis stop him achieving sporting glory. He now stars in The National Lottery’s stunning new TV ad, in which he pulls off some spectacular moves in his wheelchair at a skate park. By playing The National Lottery, you raise £ million for good causes every week* – and during the pandemic, aside from the Government, no one has made a greater contribution to those affected than National Lottery players.When we all play a little, fun stuff happens.

Kate proved true to her word and when she invited little Mila Sneddon and her family to the Queen’s official Edinburgh home, wore an ME+EM outfit that matched the four-year-old’s dress. The outgoing little girl who is battling cancer has captured the duchess’ heart and when they met she told the youngster she wanted to give her a “big squeezy cuddle”. Mila was featured in an iconic picture from Kate’s lockdown photographic project and came to symbolise isolation during the pandemic after she was pictured kissing her home’s kitchen window as her father stood outside.  The little girl is undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia and was photographed separated from her father during the first lockdown, after he had to go to work and could not risk bringing coronavirus into the family home in Falkirk.Kate and Mila had talked on the phone after the image was among  selected for the duchess’ Hold Still exhibition and book and agreed to meet up. The pair met at the Palace of Holyroodhouse and when Kate walked into the room the little girl the face of the little girl, who was joined by her parents, lit up.  “Hi Mila, look at you, Kate said. I want to give you a big squeezy cuddle, it’s so nice to meet you in person. The four-year-old stood up as did her father and mother Scott and Lynda Sneddon and her big sister Jodi. Kate praised the little girl who was dressed head-to-toe in pink with matching headband, dress and shoes. She said: “I love your dress, can you do a little twirl - and your shoes.”  The four-year-old spun round for the future Queen before running over to her father. The couple are carrying out an extensive tour of Scotland in William’s role as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.  During their visit to the Balfour Hospital in Kirkwall, William praised trauma nurse Dr Tariro Gandiya: “It must be reassuring to know we are all in this together.” The Cambridges are known by their Scottish title the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when north of the border, and Kate wore a Strathearn tartan scarf and a coat by Massimo Dutti for the visit.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal Family"},{"url":null,"title":"key questions ask buying home","story":"NewsKey questions to ask when buying a home as British Gas warns boilers more importantBritish Gas carried out research to help buyers and sellers prioritise more effectively as too many Brits choose properties based on looks only to find problems latermirrorShareCommentsByAdrian Hearn:,  MAY NewsYou need to get it right when buying a house\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The property was abandoned five years ago. Now, an auction house has put the exciting three-bed home up with the six-figure guide price – adding that it is in need of refurbishment. Auction House South Yorkshire said the home will be sold as seen, with no explanation for its mucky condition. The terraced home, nestled in the Hillsborough suburb of Sheffield, comes fully furnished – with rubbish, rotting food, and heaps of bin bags scattered in every room. The new owner will have to get their hands dirty.  The three-storey house boasts a cellar on the lower ground level, a kitchen and living room on the ground floor, three bedrooms and family bathroom. The new owner will also be treated to a erse selection of discarded toys and dirty rags. The kitchen features a stained cooker, rusty pots and pans, and a bottle of washing up liquid – which, surprisingly, appears to have been opened. Wallpaper in the top bedroom has been stripped off to reveal a rustic brick look. The shared bathroom is certainly unique – it has been fitted with a bath as well as a leather chair, and comes with an old toilet roll. The listing adds the property is just a stone’s throw away from an array of bars, restaurants and shops, as well as a tram and bus stop with links to the city centre.  But there was shock when the property was posted on social media in its soiled state.Craig Beresford, commenting on Facebook, quipped: “Hope furnitureaposs NOT included.”Mitch Wood said it would be better to get the wrecking ball out and knock [the] lot down”. Some people were more hopeful. Elyse Maria Bingham joked she had finally found her forever home.

Charles and Camilla visited the capital to show support as pubs, bars, restaurants and shops reopened after the pandemic. The pair chatted to staff and members of the public before grabbing a drink themselves. The couple marvelled at the pub which was inside was crammed with an eclectic array of items - from traffic lights to glaze legs brought back by a former owner from his travels around the globe.As he walked in, pulling a mask on, Charles commented: I’ve always thought it would be rather fun to go round visiting every Prince of Wales in the country.Hopefully I’d get a free drink in each one!

Fred would come out and chuck bags on board.”Explaining his other theory, he said: “At the time he was an odd-job man at the Lakeside caravan site at Stokes Orchard so my theory has long been he may have put the body parts in the lake.” Fred never confessed to killing Mary Bastholm but his son Stephen claimed his father admitted it to him.

He criticised his father Prince Charles for expecting his sons to endure the pressures of royal le rather than offering protection – and accused the royals of total neglect when Meghan was feeling suicidal.

We did everything that we possibly could to stay there and carry on doing the role and doing the job, he stated. But Meghan was struggling. That feeling of being trapped within the family, there was no option to leave, he added. Eventually when I made that decision for my family, I was still told, aposYou canapost do thisapos. And itaposs like, aposWell how bad does it have to get until I am allowed to do this apos She [Meghan] was going to end her le.

Met forecaster Marco Petagna said: “A long-awaited improvement in weather will see fine conditions for the Bank Holiday weekend, with more sunshine and higher temperatures. “We could tap into a very warm southerly airstream next week, with certainly the low-to-mid s for many, and perhaps the upper s locally in the south.” Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze agreed: “Forecast models suggest the highest temperatures of the year could be reached by Monday, with the possibility of very warm weather next week.” It could even feel like a heatwave after months of cold. MetDesk added: “The Bank Holiday weekend may not be a heatwave by the official definition - but itaposll certainly feel like one after recent weeks.”UK forecast for the next  days Thursday:Early fog patches soon clearing, then most parts dry with sunny spells. Feeling warmer than recently with light winds. Clouding over in the far west with some rain later. Thursday evening: Thickening cloud bringing outbreaks of rain to some western parts. Clearer skies in parts of the north and east where it will turn chilly with a few fog patches. Friday: Mostly cloudy across western and some central areas with some rain at times. Drier and brighter in parts of the east and far north where it may feel quite warm. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Largely dry with increasing amounts of sunshine and warm for most. Isolated showers on Saturday. Feeling cooler along the east coast. Maybe turning unsettled into the far northwest later Monday.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet OfficeHeatwaveWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"bartenders share code words use","story":"NewsBartenders share code words they use to sneakily talk about customers while workingBartenders have been anonymously revealing the secret code words and signals they use to talk about customers while working - and how you can tellthey think youre attractivemirrorShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBartenders are said to have a code to communicate quickly\" %, rgba, rgba, url\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your dayInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

According to a Reddit user, some bartenders have a apossecret codeapos which they use to talk about customers without them knowing.The code also allowed them to communicate quicklysomething was wrong, for instance,they had run out of a product and needed more stock.In a post on the r bartenders forum, a user explained how theyaposd been told about the code previously and wanted to find out more about it. The anonymous post read: A while ago I was told of a aposbartenders codeapos which consisted of ious numbers that were used to represent things on the bar either secretly or quickly between staff. Things like aposapos, meaning ran out of product, aposapos meaning a customer waiting, aposapos meaning to catch, and aposapos to refer to an attractive customer. It seems like a pretty fun and useful thing to get my staff doing, and I was wonderinganyone knew any more or had a dferent more comprehensive list of expressions  A number of people responded to share other code words and numbers theyaposve used in the industry.  One person claried that the use of aposapos meant they thought you were the hottest person in the building, while aposapos meant you were a hottie. While another said that when they fancied a female punter they would sneakily refer to them using the word aposshoesapos. They commented: Glasgow bartender here. When I saw the title I thought of all the codes you mentioned. Plus, we use aposshoesapos to mean an attractive woman. The bar I used to work in was frequented by bartenders a lot, so we changed that to aposgarnishesapos. A number of other codes were shared for bartending tasks, with someone  claiming they used the number aposapossomething was almost out of stock, aposapos for completely out of stock and aposapos once it was restocked. They went on to say that aposapos and aposapos were used to tell their colleagues they were going to the bathroom, while aposapos meant they needed a smoke break and aposapos was for when they were hungry and going to eat. And according to another bartender,you hear them say aposapos it means that the bar needs a wipe down or empty glasses trash needs to be taken care of. How interesting! Weaposll definitely be listening out for these in the future...Have you heard any more code words  Let us know in the comments below.

Joseph Lee, , is a caterer and was shopping at Makro Wholesale, a cash and carry, when he stopped by the fishmongers to peruse their wares. When there he couldnapost believe his eyes, as he saw two orange Canadian lobsters - which are so rare that just one in  million are ever caught, making the odds of finding two of them one in a billion. Joseph then approached the fishmonger, in landlocked Leicester, and convinced him not to sell the lobsters, which were listed for £. - but instead donate them to an aquarium. Joseph said: I went in to do my usual shopping for my catering business. I saw these two orange lobsters from a distance and thought they were toys because thataposs the only time Iaposve seen them orange apart from when theyaposre cooked. I knew they wouldnapost have put cooked lobsters in there because you need to keep lobsters in a special tank with flowing water below seven degrees. I thought someone was having a joke and had put a couple of orange toy lobsters in the tank.  I got closer and noticed they were alive. I couldnapost believe my eyes. Iaposve been going to Makro for ten years and used to be a fishmonger myself but I have never seen anything like that before. Rob the fishmonger told me they were really, really rare lobsters and to get one in the tank was a one in  million chance so the chances of having two are one in a billion. It is like getting struck by lightning three times and surviving each time. To have not just one but two in the tank is unimaginable. The dad-of-two, from Leicester, decided to try and save the lobsters from being sold so spoke to the store manager who agreed to donate them to an aquarium. He said: I couldnapost bare the thought that these extremely rare creatures would end up on someoneaposs plate. I spoke to the manager of the catering ision who said they would donate them to a Sea Le Centre. Itaposs just incredible to see two of these amazingly coloured lobsters. Iaposm glad theyaposve been saved so they can be enjoyed by people. Live lobsters normally have dark brown or grey colouring which makes it easier for them to camouflage in the wild. They only turn orange after they are cooked, making the sight of two with a carrot-coloured exoskeleton even more rare. Makro store manager Anthony Burrage said: We have donated them to Birmingham Sea Le centre. After they arrived in the store from our delivery partners we realised they were unique and not the norm we called our Quality Assurance department and they did the rest. They called Birmingham Sea Le and they were collected on Saturday.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @MirrorWeirdNewsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnRare animalsViral"},{"url":null,"title":"woman left stitches cats unenthusiastic","story":"NewsWoman left in stitches at her cats unenthusiastic response to his new toyThe moggie barely had the energy to raise a paw as his devoted owner Casey tried to entertain him with a new toy, and she admitted he actually preferred the box the gt came inmirrorShareCommentsByRosaleen FentonAudience Writer:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video woman-left-stitches-cats-unenthusiastic-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:CScGMn,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The gondola connecting the northern Italian Alps town of Stresa, on the shores of Lake Maggiore to the ,-ft Mottarone peak plunged to the ground near its highest point on Sunday. The crash killed all aboard aside from a five-year-old Israeli boy, Eitan Biran. He remains in hospital after his entire family including his parents, grandparents and brother died.Police have arrested three men in connection with the cable car disaster, saying an emergency brake system had been deactivated to overcome a fault.  Prosecutors suspect involuntary manslaughter and negligence, authorities in the northern Italian region of Piedmont say. Police say the cable caraposs brake failed to engage after a lead cable snapped, causing the carriage carrying the tourists to plummet to the ground where it crumpled in a wreck on Mottaroneaposs steep, wooded slopes. Carabinieri Lieutenant colonel Alberto Cicognani told broadcaster RAI the suspects, who he did not name, admitted that a fork-shaped clamp had been placed on the safety brake system, preventing it from operating as it should.  The cable car had not been working properly, with the brakes constantly kicking in. The clamp would stop them from activating, allowing the cable car to keep ing. It is certainly very serious and very disturbing, Olimpia Bossi, the chief prosecutor of the city of Verbania, told reporters after the arrests. With the conviction that the cable car would never break,took the risk which determined the deadly outcome, Bossi said.  A Carabinieri official in Verbania told the Reuters news agency the trio arrested were the manager of Ferrovie Mottarone, the company that manages the cable way, its director, and the manager of the cable way. The cabin was nearing the end of its journey to the top of the Mottarone mountain when the lead cable snapped, around -ft above the ground.The gondola slipped back very fast until it pulled off the cable and tumbled to earth, where it rolled over before hitting trees, police said.  The cable car underwent major maintenance work between  and . Checks were carried out in  and again last year by specialist technicians. Most of the victims died at the scene, with bodies found inside the gondolaaposs red and white wreckage and some thrown into the woods. Eitan suffered multiple broken bones and was airlted to a hospital in Turin, where he remained in a critical condition this week after undergoing surgery. The bodies of his family, including his brother Tom, , mother Tal Peleg-Biran, , father Amit Biran and great-grandparents, Barbara and Yitzhak Cohen, were being sent home to Israel on Wednesday.

It is headquartered in Wetherby.Morgan Stanley Infrastructure confirmed it is “in the preliminary stages of considering making an approach” to acquire all of Augean’s shares.The announcement to shareholders meant Augean’s shares soared by % this morning.

It’s massive.“You just want to cherish the moment as these nights don’t come around that often in your career.“I turned around in the dressing-room before the game and there were players with immense quality all around me.“On the park, when things aren’t going well, you look around and see a Premiership team.“We’ve definitely got a side here that can go and have a right good go at the Premiership and kick on.“I think we’ve got the nucleus of a team that can do something.“We’ve shown that not just on Monday but in other games.“We took a doing from Hearts at the start of the season but since then we’ve picked ourselves up, done well against Hibs in the cup and against St Johnstone we gave a good account of ourselves. | Dundee Promotion Joy As Kilmarnock are Relegated | SPFL\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed A_hgapJNaw featureoembed\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay clipboard-write encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“We’ve got a team that’s hungry and is young as well.“We’re ready for the Premiership.“We’ll do it our own way. We can rest up now and look forward to next season and start with a bang, hopefully.”The turnaround in fortunes for the Dark Blues has been a remarkable one – losing - to Hearts on the opening day, poor defeats to Ayr at home and away and failing to find any lasting consistency.Until the final stage of the season, that is.Since the - loss to the Honest Men at Dens Park, Dundee lost two matches in the next .One of those was to eventual Scottish Cup winners St Johnstone and the other in an aggregate win over Raith.On top of struggling for form at times, there has been a global pandemic to contend with in the players’ personal lives as well.That saw last season finish early with Dundee in third place and play-offs scrapped before an extended summer kept them out of action until October.And McGhee says coming out of all those dficulties in the manner they have speaks volumes for the club.“To a man, we’ve been kicked up and down the park all season by everyone,” he added.“Especially with the way we started the season against Hearts. To come back and get the club back where it belongs means everything to us as players.“I couldn’t tell you what the turning point in the season was – probably our attitude and finding confidence.“We found a formation which suited us and people have chipped in with goals all over the park.“When that happens, you’ve always got a chance of winning.”McGhee insists those struggles made their success even sweeter on Monday night.And he hopes Dundee fans can be back at Dens next season to enjoy their being back in Premiership football.He added: “I didn’t think about it too much because the whole Covid situation meant there was more to le than football.“But I think we’re stronger for what happened. The play-off games are completely dferent to any other games.“The pressure in them is unbelievable. We know we’ve got players in there who can play under pressure now.“We’ve done it in the past four games.“I think promotion is thoroughly deserved. I’m just delighted for everyone at the club and all the players and the fans back home who deserve it more than anyone.“The  who were in Dens last week were incredible so fingers crossed we get more numbers through the doors and there’s more normality for everyone.“We should cherish this moment and come out after the summer all guns blazing.”Liam Fontaine says promotion with Dundee is on a par

have condemned culprits who forced the cancellation of a mobile Angus Covid- test site two weeks’ in a row.Cones cordoning off the area of Brechin’s Maisondieu West car park for the weekly Wednesday sessions were moved.It left testing teams without sufficient space to run the drop-ins for asymptomatic residents seeking a coronavirus test.They had no option but to call off the drop-in because of what a local councillor has branded “selfish” actions.Angus Council said it will be taking steps to ensure the situation doesn#t crop up again.Brechin and Edzell representative Gavin Nicol said: “I don’t know what would go through the mind of someone to disrupt a valuable service like this as we try to emerge safely from the pandemic.#This is a really important service for our burghs.#It encourages people without symptoms to get tested and will hopefully help us keep our local rates down.#These test centres have been a great asset to many folk and there are enough around for people to know why parts of our car parks are coned off.“It might have been kids just moving the cones around, but they have to realise the problem they’ve caused and take responsibility.“But it could also have been someone who felt they were entitled to a space and didn’t care at all about the consequences for others.“That would be a pretty selfish thing to do.#To cause further upset to someone living in the same town who has concerns about their own health and that of others is just not on.”The community testing initiative is run by NHS Tayside in partnership with the Scottish Government, NHS Tayside, Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross Councils, Scottish Ambulance Service and the British Red Cross.It aims to drive down local Covid- rates and transmission by identying positive cases more quickly.People can simply drop in, but are also able to book a test by phoning  to speed up the process.The Angus sessions run in Arbroath, Monieth, Forfar, Brechin, Kirriemuir, Montrose and Carnoustie on dferent days each week.Dr Emma Fletcher, NHS Tayside director of public health said, “We are seeing a rise in the number of cases of Covid- in Tayside so it is more important than ever that the mobile testing vans are able to operate in our communities.“It is very disappointing that what I’m sure is a very small number of people in Brechin are preventing the testing team from providing this important service to the town.“Getting tested regularly for Covid- evenyou don#t have symptoms is one of the ways to keep our communities safe as restrictions ease # evenyou have been vaccinated.“Regular testing helps us to find positive cases in people who have no symptoms, but who are still infectious.“If people who test positive and their contacts self-isolate, we can break the chain of transmission and limit the spread of Covid-.“I would encourage everyone to make regular use of the testing services on offer.”An Angus Council spokesperson said: “Asymptomatic testing is a key part of the national strategy to keep this virus under control, allowing families and friends to meet, and local businesses to remain trading.#The council will continue to support the Scottish Ambulance Service and the NHS to deliver this programme in Brechin and will be taking action to ensure that this valuable facility remains available for the vast  majority of responsible Brechin citizens.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a

To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge. They were trying to renew the basement concrete which supports the new bridges in spite of the wet, cold weather.Fortunately, April was drier and they managed to fit the new gates thanks to the massive cranes and the skill of the lorry drivers carrying these heavy loads to and from the canal.Others have cleared the rubbish, including lots of old car tyres, which had been dumped.It is good to see the canal filled and in working order again.J Thorgrimsson, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"reduce farm costs save time and make life easier","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

How can we move the figure up and ensure we get all managers contributing #Jane Fowler, head of improvement and HR with the council, responded: #We would have loved to have had a greater response to that. These things come with conflicting pressures on managers’ time, which is why we offer the opportunity to be part of a working group.#The performance in getting responses to surveys is something we want to improve. We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The live action and CGI film tells of Peter#s latest adventures, this time out of the garden, where he finds himself in a world where mischief is appreciated, but soon his family comes to bring him home.Also hitting the big screen when the cinema reopens is the new part-live action and part-animated Tom and Jerry – the latest tale of the renowned mayhem-causing cat and mouse – and action-smash-fest Godzilla vs. Kong, a sequel to Godzilla: King of the Monsters and Kong: Skull Island.Coming in the next few weeks will be Nomadland, Minari, The Father, and A Quiet Place II.Alongside the newer films, the cinema has also rescheduled its #Thirty Films to See Before You#re Thirty# season, kicking off with Trainspotting and The Goonies.Ellen added: #Along with social distancing please ensure to wear your mask at all times in the building, except when eating and drinking in your cinema seat.#"},{"url":null,"title":"inez picks up prizes amid winning streak","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

With Children.\"She [Rebel] is like me, in that Ive been a working mum my whole le,\" says the -year old, who is married to Kurt Sutter, her third husband and Sons of Anarchy co-star .\"I am a much better mumIm a working mum, and I would not know how to sacrice one of them - and shes the same.\"Shes got this huge drive and passion for what she does, she also has children and loves them, and it gets messy and somebody gets neglected.\"In the series you see the repercussions on her older kids, and theyll complain about her - that she didnt spend enough time with them and she didnt make it to school s and she didnt do all that.\"But, at the same time, the two older children go into service work: ones a doctor, ones a lawyer, and theyre fighting the good fight. So, you see how it [Rebels work] kind of rubbed off on them.\"Also starring John Corbett, Tamala Jones and Andy Garcia, the series follows the \"funny, fearless, brilliant\" Rebel, and her work as a blue-collar legal advocate without a law degree.When Rebel applies herself to a fight she believes in, she will win at almost any cost.It feels notably rare still to see \"messy\" women like this on screen, and Sagal loves playing someone whos flawed.\"She is not perfect, by any means, and you get to see a three-dimensional person thats trying to juggle everything,\" elaborates the actress.\"And she orders a lot of people around - shes not always polite. Shes just kind of in your face. She thinks shes right and you have to do what she says.\"Empowering lead characters aside, what was it about this script that stood out for Sagal \"I was very energised by the creator of the show, Krista [Vernoff]. And when I knew that it was inspired by Erin Brockovich - it wasnt her le, because we dont have her le rights - I was immediately interested in that because I love what she does.\"Another draw was that Sagal knew the team behind Rebel wanted her she was actually approached and asked to play the part, she reveals.And it sounds as though it was a no-brainer to say yes.\"I love that shes working for something,\" she follows. \"I like that it means something.\"As an entertainer, I look at the whole thing as helping people, really. And then to have subject matter that actually gives voice to helping people... I dont think people necessarily need to watch television because of that but for me, personally, to be able to be saying something is important to me. So, all of that attracted me to it.\"Also, shes very dferent to me. People think just because Ive played a lot of badass characters that I am that way, but Im really not. So, thats always fun for me to be in that position.\"As part of her preparation for the role, Sagal met Brockovich, who is now in her sixties, a couple of times.She recalls having lunch with her and Vernoff, and how they all \"just got on so well\".Being able to pick up on the activists vibe informed her work on the show, she explains, as the lunch quickly \"became like a sort of girls chat\".\"I understood who she was just sitting there with her. She talks very passionately and very quickly - and shes very smart and funny.\"There is a lovely warmth that radiates from Sagal, even though the interview is through a screen, over a Zoom call.As well as an impressively ied acting career, she is also known as a singer-songwriter she worked as a backing vocalist for the likes of Bob Dylan and Etta James, was a member of Bette Midlers backup group, The Harlettes, and she still performs on stage today.\"I love to play music,\" she enthuses. \"Now its so in the right place in my le because I dont rely on music, but I have my band. We go out and play and have fun.\"We end our chat discussing what Sagal has learned about herself from making Rebel, and she muses on how all roles allow an \"inner something to be released\".In the case of Rebel, \"she gets angry a lot in the name of something righteous\" - something the star has obviously enjoyed getting her teeth into, from the way she smiles playfully when talking about the emotionally-charged scenes.\"Its so great to be able to scream and yell at somebody,\" she admits. \"And she doesnt censor herself. As a human being, I think Im a little more diplomatic, Im a little more concerned with what other people think I struggle with a lot of that. She doesnt care what you think.\"She knows that shes in the right world, she knows what she believes in and shell just let it fly - and theres something very liberating about that.\"Rebel premieres exclusively on Disney+ on Friday"},{"url":null,"title":"gardening-safe-plant-tender-veg","story":"Gardening: When is it safe to plant out tender veg Tomatoes and chillies in a bowIts just about time to plant out tender veg safely - or is it The rise and fall of temperatures this spring - April started off warm and dry, but ended up being the frostiest April in  years - has left some gardeners in a quandary about when to plant out their tender edibles, including courgettes, tomatoes and chillies.Gardening expert, bestselling author and presenter, Alys Fowler, says that a handful of tender crops need to bake in warm conditions, and sulkthey are subjected to cold and wet.\"Chillies, tomatoes and aubergines should have already been sown, although you could get away with sowing courgettes and possibly sweetcorn in mid-May,\" says Fowler, whose new book Eat What You Grow offers a wealth of advice on growing fruit and veg.As a general rule, tender plants that have been sown indoors can be taken outside between mid-May and early June, depending on where you live, but only when all danger of frost has passed.Tender plants will need to be hardened off - acclimatised gradually and with protection, whether it be a cold frame, greenhouse, sheltered porch or under a cloche, she advises.Tomatoes\"To have good tomato growth you need night-time temperatures to remain above  degrees, and preferably -C. The cold spring doesnt mean they cant go outside, but they really do need to be protected.\"They need to be in a patio greenhouse, or something like that. You can use a cold frame but really the best tomatoes are grown in a greenhouse in this country.\"Growing them outside means you are growing them really late and you wont get tomatoes until September. They need heat and sun to ripen. Dont expect to be eating them in June.\"Some ieties are better for growing outside, such as Gardeners Delight, Kenilworth and Matts Wild Cherry.\"She says hardening off takes two or three weeks, and dont just turf them out on a really sunny day, as the change in conditions can cause the plants stress and they may wilt as they try to adjust.Top tip: \"The more room that you give your tomatoes, the better they will grow. Put them in the biggest pot you possibly can. The more root mass, the healthier the plant. And as soon as you see the flowers, start feeding the plant every week.\"Chillies\"Chillies are like tomatoes, they really need heat. They come from South America and want to bask in the heat. A good place to grow them is on your windowsill, butyou are growing them outside, it needs to be a really sheltered, sunny spot like a sunny courtyard or patio.\"They make a lovely houseplant, although some grow to ft, while others are really small such as Prairie Fire, which would work on a windowsill. The chillies start off yellow and ripen to bright red.\"She notes that chillies are hungry, so will need potting on a lot more regularly than tomatoes, in fact every time the roots stick out of the bottom of the drainage holes, youll need to pot them on. And once flowers appear, feed them weekly, she advises.Top tip: \"Some ieties produce a king chilli, which is the first fruit which appears on the first axis of the plant. Take it off, otherwise it will prevent further flowering by concentrating a lot of the growth into this single fruit.\"Courgettes\"Put them out too early and you may get lots of male flowers when its cold, which will mean flowers and no courgettes, which is frustrating. The only thing to do is wait for it to warm up.\"Courgettes are big plants and people tend to put them slightly too close together. They really are better .-ft apart.\"Top tip: \"Keep picking them when they are small and they will keep producing. If you let them grow into marrows they start to think that the end of their days are coming and they wont produce so many.\"Sweetcorn\"If you havent sown it already, you can still sow sweetcorn in May, preferably indoors in pots. The minute theyve got to a good size - thicker than a pencil - get them in the ground when all danger of frost has passed.\"They are wind-pollinated, so you need to plant them in a block so that you raise the chances of the pollen hitting a neighbour. Plant them between - inches apart ideally. They dont need staking but keep them out of a direct wind tunnel.\"Sweetcorn are easy to grow but they will need a fairly good summer to produce good cobs.\"Top tip: \"If you think theyre getting rocked about too much, you can draw up the soil around the base.\"Eat What You Grow by Alys Fowler is published by Kyle Books, priced pound.

As we await OECDrsquos final word on the curriculum, we take this opportunity to highlight some of our concerns.CfE began as a promising development, and it is still laudable for its forward-thinking and holistic aims. Itrsquos not too late for these ambitions to be realised and used to build a world-class Stem education system, however we must first recognise the wider context that has hindered its delivery. Even the best-designed Stem curriculum will falter in the face of pervasive and persistent structural challenges.Reforming the senior phase led to a narrowing of subject choice, sowing the initial seeds for a review of CfE and contributing to declines in enrolment in Stem subjects at SCQF levels  and  since .Secondly, Scotland faces shortages of subject-specialist teachers, and secondary school laboratory technicians, both of which are critical to delivering the kind of engrossing Stem experiences which inspire lelong interest in these subjects.More widely, classrooms are having to resort to multi-course teaching ndash the dficult practice of teaching more than one course in the same timeslot ndash to combat the effects of limited staff capacity and timetabling pressures.Finally, primary teachers can lack confidence in teaching Stem an increased focus on Stem subjects in primary teacher education, both initial and career-long, is required to build teachersrsquo knowledge and understanding in these subjects.Among its widespread havoc, Covid- upended many of our traditional approaches to education, from empty classrooms to exam cancellations. Many of these adjustments were profoundly stressful and often had the greatest impact on the most disadvantaged learners. However, they also prompted important questions and challenged longstanding assumptions of what it means to assess learning.As the pandemic and its aftershocks subside, some of these changes may persist and gain further traction. There could be an opportunity to reconfigure assessments to improve their effectiveness and reduce teacher workloads. However, rather than rushing into any large-scale educational upheavals on the back of post-Covid recovery, any lessons learned will need to be sensitively applied, ensuring they bring genuine benefit for teachers, parents, and pupils alike.Stem education in Scotland faces several obstacles. While valuable in its own right, its role in building the next generation of problem-solvers and keeping Scotlandrsquos economy and research sectors internationally competitive cannot be denied. With the right systemic changes, Curriculum for Excellence can live up to its name ndash and support an exceptional Stem education system in the process.Professor David Cole-Hamilton FRSE is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and interim chair of the LSG."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-smooth-return-work-depends-handling-change","story":"HYBRID working, where people split time between home and office, is the consequence of a year of novel change in the workplace and looks set to stay. But even as businesses contemplate reopening they must remember that change is unsettling and ato \"normal\" may feel anything but to employees.Throughout lockdown, we carried out surveys to gauge how clients saw their businesses changing as restrictions tightened. And now, as they ease, many businesses acknowledge that office le will undergo signicant change.Accommodating flexible working means some fundamental aspects might be lost and others added. Hygiene stations and \"Zoom spaces\" are set to become part of office design, but the days of personal desks for every employee are numbered. And while this is a logical approach to flexible working, the wise business will bring their employees with them on the change journey, before implementing it.Physical space has to support, and be aligned with, new working practices, rather than the other way round. Whether existing space is reconfigured or new offices acquired, it is vital to engage with employees on how best to use the new space to reduce old working practices or workarounds creeping back in.We love our own desks, but our experience is that inidual desk \"ownership\" leads to a lot of empty desks. The loss of a space to call your own can be unsettling for iniduals, no matter how logical it might be for the business as a whole. Thought and consultation is needed to make \"hot-desking\" accepted. Some solutions might include personal storage or locker spaces, appropriate portable technology and providing smaller, more flexible private spaces where telephone calls or remote meetings can take place without disruption.Numerous figures have been reported with regards to future space requirementand some organisations have declared the end of the office altogether, stating that their people can work from home indefinitely. Time will tell what the actual change will be.One thing cannot be denied. People want to get back to their offices primarily to interact once more with their colleagues. The informal knowledge-sharing that comes from everyone sharing a workspace cannot be replicated through remote links alone. The sense of belonging that comes from feeling part of something bigger, and an understanding of a business culture and ethos relies on observation and interaction. This is especially true for new starts and junior staff.Physical workspace changes, which might be cost-saving can have other costs in terms of workplace happiness and productivity. So as workplaces open, the transition will ultimately be so much better for those companies that make spatial design decisions that support how their employees want to work, bring staff into the change process and not impose it upon them.Phil Muir is Group Director Consultancy and Design, SPACE"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12623330.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kevin-mckenna-cummings-statements-reveal-covid-19-response-shambolic","story":"THE question by Rebecca Long-Bailey in todayrsquos evidence session of the Health and Social Care Committee cut to the heart of the UKrsquos shambolic response to Coronavirus.The Labour MP asked Dominic Cummings about his tweet last week that pointed to ldquodestructive behaviour in the political system.

The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure.

The kilt has never been so ubiquitous, but maybe a lot of men think the lighter, cheaper kilt is easier to wear and lug about. The cost of a hand-made kilt can also be daunting ndash these days, you can easily pay more than pound,.The other problem with kilts is that,you do get one, it comes with a lot of baggage and attitude, some of which is a load of rubbish. For many, the kilt is the standardised vision of Scotland, but they werenrsquot always so common. My parents married in the s and it didnrsquot even cross my fatherrsquos mind to wear a kilt. I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar.

But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria.

The SNPrsquos electronic bard Pete Wishart is similarly engaged in the juvenile pursuit of Mr Johnson with his repeated jibe that he is \"a clown in clownrsquos shoes\".Comparisons of Mr Johnson with Churchill are all too frequently overblown but one common characteristic is a shared determination to employ robust argument without denigrating their opponents.

Especially at Holyrood.One of the interesting dferences between yesterdayrsquos session and the typical Scottish Parliament offering was who was in charge.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchOpening the questions and setting the tone of blunt inquiry was Greg Clark, a minister from the outset of the Toriesto power in , who held two cabinet posts and is now chair of the Commons science and technology select committee.The other lead inquisitor was Jeremy Hunt, a three-time cabinet secretary from  to  who now chairs the health and social care committee.It is not unusual for former big beasts to chair select committees, posts that are not only elected by MPs, conferring authority, but are remunerated at pound, a year, so the occupants have to earn their keep.It helps maintain the tradition of independent-minded scrutiny, even by MPs of the governing party.The experience former ministers bring to the job is also invaluable as they know best how the system works and how best to penetrate the wiles and evasions of officialdom.Both Mr Clark and Mr Hunt are Tories perfectly willing to make le hard for a Tory Prime Minister.Yes, both were Remainers ousted in Boris Johnsonrsquos first reshuffle, so there may be personal factors at play, but they are still part of a healthier-than-Holyrood system where loyalty to onersquos party is not paramount.Meanwhile in Edinburgh, it is rare for recent ministers to be committee conveners, and rarer still for former cabinet secretaries to take on the role.In the - Scottish parliament, there were only three former SNP ministers who led committees, and only two in the - session, when one former cabinet secretary also fleetingly took charge of a committee for two recess months one year.In Westminster, committee chair is a perfectly respectable afterle for a former minister or cabinet secretary, with remuneration offering lsquojam todayrsquo to make up for the workload.Holyrood is quite dferent. Conveners are not elected by the parliament as a whole, but by the MSPs on each committee.:Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionWith parties choosing which MSPs go where, it gives the government of the day a huge say in who gets many of the gigs, and naturally it has no wish to implant thorns in its own side.Convenerships are very often the stepping stones to ministerial office.There is no remuneration for the considerable amount of extra graft.Instead, there is the lure of lsquojam tomorrowrsquo in the form of promotion.That incentivises loyalty to the government and not causing a fuss.Other MSPs of the governing party follow this example. Mavericks, such as Alex Neil, are welcome but rare.Holyroodrsquos committee system was famously supposed to be the jewel in its crown, offering the scrutiny of a second chamber without the cost.But as we enter a sixth parliamentary term, its clear theyrsquove been a let-down, arguably reaching their nadir in the gutless toadying from some SNP MSPs during the Alex Salmond inquiry.Some problems come down to the parliamentrsquos size. The talent pool is more paddling than ing.Even with the SNP having close to a majority, around a fth of all MSPs are part of the government, and so unavailable for committee duty.Infrequent reshuffles mean a low turnover in ministers, so government experience is lacking among the rest.The present First Ministerrsquos habit of re-hiring old hands also leaves former ministers who are on committees wonderingthey might one day , so best to bite their tongue.There have been many tinkering attempts at reform. In , then Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick asked the Standards Committee to investigate the case for elected conveners, an idea she supported.ldquoIf conveners were elected by the whole Parliament, they would derive their authority and mandate from the Parliament itself, she said.ldquoThis sht of responsibility... would strengthen the role of the Parliament and so enhance the sharing of power between the government, the Parliament and the people.The Committee preferred fudge, concluding the Parliament ldquoshould set aside the idea on elected conveners and discuss general scrutiny instead.The next PO, Ken Macintosh, tried again, establishing an independent commission on parliamentary reform to help improve scrutiny.It backed elected conveners, with procedures in place from the start of the current session, with potential remuneration based on workload.The committees have yet to be formed for this session, but there is no sign yet of any elections or pay bumps.Instead, it looks like the same old patronage and pusillanimity.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday promised ldquounashamedly ambitious policies for the coming term, while priding herself on Holyrood not transplanting ldquothe old ways of Westminster.But grand plans merit deep scrutiny and Holyrood doesnrsquot offer it.ldquoWe do not claim a monopoly of wisdom, the First Minister added.In that case,some Westminster ways are worth importing, do it."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647717.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-road-closures-announced-cop26-summit","story":"Details of roads close to the event at the citys SEC campus have been released for the first time along with a map.It comes as businesses are being invited to sign-up for an event to find out about the work being done to prepare Glasgow for the arrival COP.The virtual event is being organised as part of the Get Ready Glasgow campaign developed by Glasgow City Council in partnership with event organisers - the UK Government, and with Police Scotland and Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.Read more:Scotlands covid memorial campaign boosted by trust fund donationAs host city of this potentially historic climate change summit, Glasgow is in a position to raise its profile globally as a sustainable city, attract investment to key sectors and promote itself as a visitor destination.Get Ready Glasgow campaign is aimed at keeping the city moving and open for business in the lead up to and during the COP conference.It will also be used to make sure the city is prepared to welcome visitors and that citizens feel confident and reassured about Glasgow hosting a covid-safe event.The event comes as details of the impact of the conference on this cityrsquos road network around the main venue, the SEC, and river restrictions are announced. These measures are needed to facilitate the safe delivery of the event and maintain the safety and security of participants, citizens and visitors:Exact dates on the period of road closures and when they will come into effect are still to be confirmed but will be widely communicated in the coming months.Glasgow road closures in place for COPDiversion routes will be in place around the SEC to keep traffic moving and, as with previous city events, Local Area Traffic Management Plansare being developed to keep traffic moving for road users.Active travel routes are still being refined, however, pedestrian and cycle access will be maintained on Finnieston Street, Lancefield Quay and Clyde Arc at all times as will routes for emergency services.The River Clyde will be closed to private and commercial vessels ahead of and during COP. It is proposed that a safety zone is established from the first tidal weir at Glasgow Green to a position just east of King George V Docks. This stretch of the river will not be able to host vessels or water-based activities around the summit site.To keep the city moving and open for business, people will be advised to prepare journeys in advance, but with built in flexibility in case of unexpected disruption.The campaign also includes further engagement sessions in the lead up to COP and the development of a business ready guide, due to be published late June.The Get Ready Glasgow website will also provide information about plans to deliver a covid-safe event based on the most up-to-date public health guidance, and what measures will be put in place to protect citizens and the participants in COP.Ros Eales, Chief Operating Officer, COP Unit said: ldquoCOP, is an exciting and historic moment for the city. The Conference will be an inclusive event, bringing together world leaders, delegates, academics, businesses, civil society groups and activists from over the world to inspire climate change action.ldquoSupport from businesses in the city and the people of Glasgow is crucial to making this Conference a success and we thank you, as well as other businesses and communities of Glasgow, for your support so far and look forward to continuing to work with you this year.Councillor Susan Aitken, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said: ldquoThe purpose of Get Ready Glasgow is to ensure that business and residents have the information they need to go about their daily lives while COP is running.ldquoPlanning teams concentrating on city operations have been established to manage the impact of COP on the city and what impact the events will have on the services that the council provides to businesses and residents in their day-to-day lives.ldquoIf we start to talk about some of the things that may change in the lead up to and during the COP now, people, particularly businesses, can begin to think about how they may need to adapt their operations, particularly on the days where the city may be busier than usual, due to the main COP programme or side events.ldquoCOP will change the way the city runs for a period of time in November but we will make sure that everyone is well informed and when the time comes people can feel proud at Glasgow having played its part in the success of such a globally signicant event.Routes around the SEC campus will be affected during COPAssistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins, Police Scotland, said COP will be one of the most high profile and signicant security and policing events ever held in the United Kingdom.He said: ldquoCOP presents some unique policing challenges but Police Scotland is well prepared for any eventuality. Our main focus will be on the delivery of a safe and secure event and also managing likely activist activity, while keeping the city, and indeed the country, operational and moving.Stuart Patrick, Chief Executive of the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said few events in Glasgowrsquos history can match the signicance of the cityrsquos hosting of COP.Mr Patrick said: \"It is an opportunityto show just how much our city can contribute both to solving climate change andtolaying the foundations for our next phase of economic growth.There will be a signicant and positive long-term impact ofGlasgow being at the centre of the solutions.ldquoIt is vitally important that plans are made and implemented to handle the event and its impact on the day-to-day running of the city, and Glasgow Chamber is ready and willing to support these plans in our role as the mechanism to engage with the business community."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12647832.jpg?type=article-full","title":"time-scottish-businesses-get-handle-green-revolution-climate-solutions","story":"THE climate emergency is all around us. It now influences our thoughts and actions in innumerable ways, so it is essential that we are properly informed about it. The more we understand, the more we can do to combat it.Learning is the key to this, and itrsquos an area in which Scotland is emerging as a global leader. Today, The Herald is launching an exciting and empowering new programme that aims to bring climate change discussion and solutions to iniduals and organisations everywhere ndash not just in this country, but around the world.Our Herald Climate Solutions initiative is linked with Climate Solutions Network, a pioneering new initiative developed by The Royal Scottish Geographical Society in association with the Institute of Directors , Universities of Stirling and Edinburgh and Jump Digital.This ground-breaking project offers two compelling courses allowing participants to learn about the climate crisis and how they can help to address it.One is the Climate Solutions Professional., which consists of four easy-to-follow web-based modules and an online workshop. It will help time-poor managers to understand climate issues and their relevance to their organisations and personal lives.The second is Climate Solutions Accelerator, an express online learning programme which teaches the basics in vital areas such as climate science and policy legislation and offers ideas around solutions in just  minutes.Both courses feature highly motivational materials as well as contributions from some of the worldrsquos leading figures in the fight against climate change.Those featured include global campaigner Greta Thunberg, former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, ex-Irish President Mary Robinson, former Norwegian Premier Gro Harlem Brundtland and recent UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.The programmes are the brainchild of Mike Robinson, CEO of the Perth-based Royal Scottish Geographical Society and a veteran climate change and sustainability campaigner.In  he helped found, and chaired, Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, the largest civil society coalition ever formed in this country.What drove him to launch this new programme  ldquoIt became obvious to me that far too many people still didnrsquot understand the relevance of climate change to their businesses and they didnrsquot have the time to sort that out, he explains. ldquoI realised I had built up a lot of knowledge in this area and that there wasnrsquot anything out there that could teach people what they could do. So I got together with the IoD and Edinburgh and Stirling Universities to produce this course.The full four-module course has recently been launched and contains some  hours of online learning as well as the two workshops. ldquoThere is a lot of expertise crammed into it. We had already had about  people subscribe to it, including  in the Scottish Government.ldquoItrsquos aimed at people who are managers, directors or board members ndash anyone who wants to have a robust organisation. Wersquove got people signed up from a whole range of sectors and I think that is part of its appeal. The point is that climate change is now pervasive. It goes beyond the Sustainability Officer or a single department.ldquoItrsquos going to impact every aspect of organisations, so itrsquos really important that everyone from the board through to Finance Directors through to those in personnel, HR, purchasing and other areas has a better and more rounded understanding of where this is all going.ldquoWe do touch on the science, though that has been settled for quite a long time and we only tell people what they really need to know. Then therersquos another part that is about the inevitability of the direction of travel.ldquoPeople need to realise the ways things are going on this ndash the forthcoming COP conference in Glasgow later this year is a case in point. International commitments on climate change are ramping up year on year.The shorter, single session Climate Solutions Accelerator programme offers the basics in an easy-to-digest fashion. Several organisations have signed up to put their entire senior management, and in some cases their entire workforce, through one or other of the two courses. And this appeal is global.ldquoOne major US company enrolled some of its Scottish staff in an early session of the full course and quickly decided that the learning and knowledge gained needed to be rolled out to all its staff globally, more to follow on this. Wersquore getting a sense now that there is a really strong appetite for this sort of thing ndash businesses really want to understand the issues and get on top of them quickly.ldquoThe global names wersquove brought in on both of the programmes to help convey the message have helped with the content and to make it clear why people need to wake up to this issue.Although the courses are attracting interest worldwide,Mike Robinson says that they are unapologetically Scottish. ldquoCountries are at dferent points and therersquos no question that Scotland is well ahead of the rest of the world on this journey.ldquoNo-one is perfect in this, but the UK is the leading country on addressing climate issues in the G and Scotland is the leader within the UK, with much more stringent commitments than the other parts. That means that we have a responsibility, but there is also an opportunity for us in terms of leadership. Itrsquos about helping people understand the whole of the debate so they can be better informed and better prepared. I hope that by taking the courses, they will be better able to build change and deliver the future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12587103.jpg?type=article-full","title":"lorna-slater-scottish-greens-optimistic-formal-agreement-snp-holyrood","story":"Ms Slater said that she \"wouldnt expect\" any deal between the parties to mirror the format set down by alliances between the Liberal Democrats with both Labour and the Conservatives at Holyrood and Westminster in recent years.The newly-elected MSP said that talks with Nicola Sturgeons SNP were in a very early stage and may not be resolved for months, and that both parties were looking for common ground.:Nicola Sturgeon in talks with Greens over groundbreaking cooperation dealThe First Minister announced yesterday thather SNP Government is holding talks with the Scottish Greens over a possible \"formal cooperation agreement\".The First Minister said the move could see Green MSPs entering the Scottish Government as ministers.Structured talks, supported by the civil service, will now take place with a view to reaching a deal between the SNP and the Greens.Ms Slater is no-leader with Patrick HarvieSpeaking this morning, Ms Slater said that the aim was to establish a \"new kind of politics\".She told BBC Radio Scotland: \"What were hoping to achive is to create a dferent kind of working environment in the Scottish Parliament to prioritize the kind of things that really matter to the Scottish Green Party - which is a fair and green recovery from the pandemic.\"To put practical actions in place to tackle the climate crisis.

Instead, the decoration and design suggests that it is a piece of Central Asian metalwork from halfway round the known world.ldquoWhat was revealed was decoration that is unlike the other two, they were made in a Christian context in the Carolingian empire probably sometime in the th century AD.ldquoOur vessel has non-Christian symbolism on it and in particular there is a central icon which is a Zoroastrian fire altar and Zoroastrianismwas the state religion of the Sassanian empire, which is much further to the east in central Asia, what was Persia and is modern day Iran, and there are leopards and tigers in the vegetation on the vessel and the whole thing just has a much dferent symbolism.ldquoIt was quite a surprise, itrsquos really opened up that international picture.Dr Chris Breward, director of NMS, described the hoard as ldquoprobably the most signicant find from the period of the Vikings in Britain or Ireland that we know of.The exhibition, which opens on Saturday, shows how the hoard was buried in four distinct parcels ndash two of silver bullion and one a cluster of four elaborately-decorated silver ldquoribbon arm-rings bound together and concealing a small wooden box containing three items of gold.:poundm grant will help unwrap Viking hoard secretsThe final parcel was a lidded, silver gilt vessel wrapped in layers of textile and packed full of carefully wrapped objects that appear to have been curated like relics or heirlooms.They include beads, pendants, brooches, bracelets, an elaborate belt-set, a rock crystal jar and other curios, often strung or wrapped with silk, as well as two mysterious balls of dirt containing tiny specks of gold.The beads found in the containerThese balls are similar to other lumps of earth preserved by the Vatican archives, purported to have been dug up by pilgrims in the Holy Land of the Middle East and brought back to Europe.Samples of the actual ground Jesus and the apostles walked on would have been considered holy relics, explaning why they were secreted away among other more obvious valuables.It is not known why the hoard, which had items belonging to four owners, was buried, though they were typically hidden by people under threat or stress who hoped to reclaim them later.Research into the hoard, found by metal detectorist Derek McLennan, continues through a pound million project led by NMS in partnership with the University of Glasgow.The exhibition Galloway Hoard: Viking-age Treasure will be open at the National Museum of Scotland in Chambers Street, Edinburgh, until September  when it will then tour to Kirkcudbright Galleries and Aberdeen Art Gallery."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12649848.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgows-hampden-park-transformed-ahead-opening-euro-2020-fixture","story":"Our images show the iconic South Side stadium clad in official Euro  banners and badges ahead of the tournaments kick-off on June .The Mount Florida venue will play host to Scotlands opening game against the Czech Republic three days later when Steve Clarkes men make history by playing in a major mens tournament for the first time in more than  years.The national stadium will also see the Scots welcome Croatia in their final group match with a trip to face rivals England at Wembley sandwiched in-between the two fixtures.In all, four games are to take place at Hampden, including one last- tie on June .The tournament, which was delayed last year due to the Covid- pandemic, is being held across  host cities and will run between June  and July .As we reported this week, a giant fan zone is to be set up in Glasgow Green throughout to give supporters the chance to get a taste of the action.Euro  banners have also been placed on lampposts throughout the city "},{"url":null,"title":"term-digital-native-term-not-compute-scottish-classrooms","story":"TECHNOLOGY is ubiquitous: it surrounds us to the point where we use it intuitively and virtually without noticing.

Computers and IT are simultaneously our best friend and an inhibitor to our advancement. We know things will happen when we click an app without ever really thinking about how it works or remembering that skilled people have worked to create and polish that app.This creates an assumption and an entitlement that acts as a barrier to learning when it comes to learning computer science. If youngsters in particular grow up with technology all around them, the thinking goes, then why should they feel the need to build that technology themselves Todayrsquos children are generallyregarded as what are known as lsquodigital nativesrsquo ndash young people who have grown up with computers and the internet as an integral part of their lives and as such, they are all comfortable and confident using these things.But the challenge is getting them to realise thatthey donrsquot develop a consciousness and a curiosity about the technology in their hands, itrsquos hard to convince them that they should consider a career in the science underlying it.To put it another way,someone is having a smooth ride in a modern car, they really donrsquot need to think about what is happening underneath the bonnet in the engine compartment.

It also assumes that they will automatically have the skills they need to enter the sort of tech-centric careers we are trying to encourage students into.ldquoThat might be the case for a minority, but it certainly isnrsquot for a majority. In fact, the phrase lsquodigital nativersquo diminishes the work that we do by suggesting the programmes we support for young people arenrsquot really needed.He adds: ldquoThey can go through school thinking that all they need to do is pick up an iPad and they can find everything they need on the internet.ldquoBut when they get beyond school and into university or an apprenticeship, they find they do need some computer science skills for a lot of careers in the world today ndash and not just tech-based roles. Once they realise they donrsquot have the necessary skills to get into many job markets, what do they do then  They can reskill or upskill but itrsquos much easierwe instil these computing skills earlier.Kraig makes the point that previous generations using popular early domestic computers such as the Commodore  or BBC Micro generally had to learn something about programming.ldquoYou had to know about computational thinking just to use them! Modern computers have eliminated that need. Thatrsquos good in many ways, it makes technology more accessible, but it also means many modern users donrsquot have those skills anymore.The declining numbers of computer science teachers in Scottish schools over the last  years hasnrsquot helped the situation. Even in , computer science is not taught in every secondary school.In the Highlands alone ndash an area nearly the size of Belgium ndash there are nine full-time Computer Science teachers covering  secondary schools. ldquoI think most senior leadership teams in schools appreciate how important the subject is by now, but because many donrsquot have the staff or resources, they canrsquot be as proactive in promoting the subject or getting their students as involved as they would like.Last yearrsquos Logan Review into education produced for the Scottish Government recommended that computer science should be treated as a core subject such as maths and physics.Kraig supports this, though he concedes the shortage of computing teachers will be an issue. ldquoThe challenges with computer science at the secondary level is negatively impacting a lot of young people in Scotland, eventhey donrsquot know it yet. I believe one solution is to aggressively upskill our primary teachers and introduce computing skills at an earlier stage to give them the foundational skills they need as well as excite them about the possibilities of tech.Recruiting more computer science teachers or introducing these skills earlier wonrsquot helpthere isnrsquot uptake from young people in secondary and beyond. How can the question of exciting students about building computing skills be successfully addressed  He believes the learning must be directly connected to real le.ldquoIn my opinion, the best way is to get industry involved ndash ideally young experts or professionals, but really anyone who can talk about their career, the skills they use, and how technology impacts this. So much of what we do in daily le is based on technology and the pandemic has only amplied this. It has also highlighted the growing importance of having technology and connectivity in place for all.Many people born before  have recently learned new digital skills as a matter of necessity. Kraig believes that the same kind of urgency and thinking is now required to inspire todayrsquos generation of young people to take the next steps to become digital creators and digital leaders, not simply lsquodigital nativesrsquo.www.digitalxtrafund.scot"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : amFor the first time in its almost -year history, the Orkney Folk Festival will be held virtually, this weekend.

This month, a group of people from around the country have decided to make their work-outs matter for those who need it most, by running in support of international relief development charity, Tearfund.Saraand Ricardo will be running km each day while currently teaching in Malaysia. Sara teaches Reception-aged children and Ricardo teaches maths to secondary students. “Running in Malaysia has certainly been hot, humid and sweaty’, Sara says, “But it is a worthy challenge. My husband and I dont run regularly so it has been good to spend time working on our stamina, especially in a hot climate. “Running has also many mental health benefits and as we are in Lockdown # here in Malaysia, it is good to get outside and go for a run to clear the head.”The pair have been in Malaysia since .The group of  members is together covering the distance between Belfast and the very tip of North Africa - , kms, over the month of May. Running mainly in Northern Ireland with a few international participants in Malaysia, Lincolnshire and Geneva, they hope to raise pound, for Tearfund - which could help up to , families living in poverty with health and hygiene training and food support as they await safe access to a Covid-vaccine.Millions of people in Northern Ireland are now partially or fully vaccinated. But for billions of people around the world, a vaccine is still a long way off. It is estimated that amongst people living in poverty, only  in  will access a safe vaccine this year with most others having to wait until next year or even  before they are able to.Sara says, ‘Covid- has affected so many people around the world in many dferent ways. From the loss of jobs to the loss of loved ones, it has been a very dficult time for many. “We are both fortunate that we have been able to work from home and that our families are safe. We feel it is so important to help others in need, especially during this dficult time. “To raise money for food to feed families and to support those in need of imminent healthcare is something we should all consider doingwe can.’Glen Mitchell, Tearfund’s NI Director, says: “We talk about the pandemic being a storm we are all experiencing, but in very dferent boats. This inequality has never been more evident than when it comes to the access to Covid- vaccines.AMPLE DOSES“Those of us who live in countries with enough resource to purchase ample doses of the vaccine are often also those who can afford to social distance and freely access things like clean water or soap. “For many people living in poverty, going to work in crowded spaces is their only chance at putting food on the table for their families. Still others, in refugee camps for example, have no way of isolating. “Many others have to walk for miles in order to access clean water, which they then have to ration through the day,’ he added.“Tearfunds core values are centred around compassion and being servant-hearted,” notes Sara.“The work that they have done and continue to do to help those in poverty or in the face of natural disasters is humbling. “We had heard of the km a day in May challenge through word of mouth and wanted to be part of it to help families. “To know that pound can provide a family with health and hygiene training and food support for  months whilst they wait for the vaccine, really motivated us to jump on board and do our bit to help!“For over  years, Tearfund has walked alongside communities around the world as they respond to disasters, including supporting people living with HIV and those affected by recent Ebola outbreaks. Tearfund helps communities to recover and create a more resilient new normal’. VULNERABLE“And now, Tearfund is working through local partners in more than  countries where the most vulnerable people need help with emergency food and hygiene supplies before, during and after Covid- vaccines become available. “Tearfund is playing a vital role by preventing the spread of the virus through improved hygiene and sanitation and supporting our locally based partners and churches to m“ake a meaningful, sustained response. While people are waiting for access to the vaccination, it is important to act to mitigate the spread of the virus and its impacts.The aid and development organisation is also working to spread accurate information about Covid- vaccines. ‘Alongside our work tackling poverty, we are also helping church leaders and organisations to use their influence to build a good understanding of the Covid- vaccines and help shape and support vaccination programmes that are good for society, particularly the most vulnerable and marginalised.”From the support she and Ricardo have received, Sara is encouraged: “We have been blown away by the generosity of our friends and family during our km a day in May challenge. “It has also been great to be part of a community with others who are also completing the challenge. “The simple words of encouragement and opportunity for accountability with pictures and Strava screenshots has really helped to spur us both on each day for our next run. “The Tearfund staff have provided helpful tips and cheered us on every step of the way!”To make a donation in support of Tearfund’s work responding to coronavirus around the world and support Sara and Ricardo’s running challenge, visit their Justgiving page at https:justgiving fundraising Sara-Braganza.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteFermanagh and South Tyrone DUP group express ‘disgust’ at removal of Arlene Foster as leaderLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestAC-’s latest recruits... a Line of Duty hen partyAutonomous vehicles join regular traffic in Cambridge in UK firstDrag queens walk the carpet at Death Drop’s West End reopeningAcademy sets a date for the  OscarsMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteFermanagh and South Tyrone DUP group express ‘disgust’ at removal of Arlene Foster as leaderLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestAC-’s latest recruits... a Line of Duty hen partyAutonomous vehicles join regular traffic in Cambridge in UK firstDrag queens walk the carpet at Death Drop’s West End reopeningAcademy sets a date for the  OscarsMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Niall Carson PA WireLauren HarteTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIncoming DUP leader Edwin Poots has refused to be drawn on whether he would be willing to attend Massinvited.Mr Poots is a member of the Orange Order which forbids members from taking part in Catholic ceremonies.However, previous DUP leaders have in recent years steered the party away from this hardline attitude.If he accepted an invitation from the Catholic church he would be following in the footsteps of his two predecessors.Peter Robinson attended the funeral Mass of murdered Catholic PSNI officer Constable Ronan Kerr at the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Beragh, Co Tyrone in April .It was the first time a DUP leader had attended a Catholic Mass.It was also the first time any Taoiseach had attended the funeral of a PSNI officer.In March , Arlene Foster was applauded as she entered Derry’s Long Tower church for the Requiem Mass of former Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness.Mrs Foster later revealed she “lost friends over going” to the funeral but still believed “it was the right thing to do”.A fundamentalist Christian, Mr Poots is a member of the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, founded in  by Dr Ian Paisley  years before he established the DUP.If Mr Poots reverses the policy of his immediate predecessors and declines invitations to attend Mass, it is likely to increase fears from some observers that he wants to bring the DUP back to its traditional evangelical roots.A DUP spokesman told The Irish Catholic: “The DUP has worked with the Catholic Church on many issues from freedom of worship through to protecting the le of the unborn.”However, when asked whether Mr Poots would accept an invitation to attend Mass, the spokesman said: “Mr Poots is heartened that people of all faiths are able toto congregational worship and has received a number of invitations from the faith community which he will consider in due course”.Last October, the Agriculture minister made controversial comments that levels of Covid- are higher in nationalist areas than unionist ones.Mr Poots claimed the dference in virus transmission between nationalist and unionist areas was “around six to one”Sinn Fein’s John O’Dowd subsequently called on the Lagan Valley MLA to apologise for his remarks, claiming Mr Poots had effectively accused nationalists of spreading the virus. He said the remarks had caused “huge offence”.Mr Poots later denied his remarks were sectarian, saying they could not be because “most Sinn Fein leaders don’t attend the Catholic Church on a regular basis”..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearFermanagh and South Tyrone DUP group express ‘disgust’ at removal of Arlene Foster as leaderVictim of notorious paedophile Billy Adams tells of role pervert’s twisted priest gay lover played in financing her sexual abuseTop VideosPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie saysSelf isolation requirement scrapped for movement within Common Travel AreaAntrim man who caused the death of his friend in a crash while on drink and drugs is jailed for seven yearsSame effort must be applied to tackling waiting lists as Covid: Michelle O’NeillDepartment of Health ‘committed’ to Northern Ireland abortion servicesLatestAC-’s latest recruits... a Line of Duty hen partyAcademy sets a date for the  OscarsMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie saysHolyrood minister seeks talks with Patel on ‘more humane’ immigration approachWilliam ends Scottish tour by praising the nation and its people,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The coup, which cleaned out bookies in Ireland and England, was simple but brilliantly conceived and executed.Curley had noted that there was only one public telephone at the racetrack at Bellewstown in the heart of rural Ireland. There was also a private line, but mysteriously it was out of action that day, presumed to have been cut. In tandem with the Belfast bookie Sean Graham, Curley had organised a small army of associates to bet anything from £ to £ in bookie shops around Ireland and England on his “slow but steady” horse Yellow Sam, running in the .pm Mount Hanover Amateur Handicap hurdle that Wednesday. But crucially he had to prevent news of the gamble getting to the course in order to keep the odds at  .Five minutes before the bets were laid, Benny O’Hanlon, an associate of Curley’s, wedged himself into the only working telephone box at the course and refused to budge, preventing news of the money piling on the horse being relayed to the on-course bookies. So Yellow Sam, a rank outsider with jockey Michael Furlong on board, passed the winning post well ahead of the rest of the field. Curley made an estimated £, on that single race.“We paid out like men,” said the Dublin bookie Terry Rodgers, ruefully. “But what annoyed me later on was the revelation that Curley and Graham had been in cahoots, which is a bit rich for a guy who is always going on about bookies rigging the market. It’s fortunate for Barney that he trained as a theologian, because he can justy everything he does to his Jesuitical conscience.”Curley then bought Middleton Park, a stately home on nearly  acres on the shores of Lough Ennell, in Co Westmeath. It was originally the ancestral home of Sir Cecil Boyd-Rochford, horse trainer to British royalty. At the foot of the great staircase he told me in  that his main reasons for disposing of the mansion was because the Irish telephone system was so unreliable, he didn’t know who might be listening in on the line as he planned his secretive gambling exploits.But instead of selling the estate he raffled it. With an elaborate brochure, a video featuring racing and GAA commentator, Michael O’Hehir and appearances on RTE’s Late Late Show and other media he grossed an estimated £.m selling , tickets at £ each. But when gardai raided the house the week before the draw, they came away with just one ticket, leaving Curley with a warning that what he was doing was illegal.With the draw due to take place at pm on Thursday, February , , in a nearby hotel, Curley surmised that the gardai might seize the tickets before the winner could be picked. In a pre-emptive strike at am that morning, as several gardai arrived following a front page story in the Evening Herald, O’Hehir hastily drew the winning ticket bearing the name of Tony Ray.Curley and O’Hehir were arrested and appeared before Judge William Tormey at Ballynacargy District Court, charged with running an illegal lottery. O’Hehir was cleared as his was a “professional” assignment. The judge, a racing man himself, convicted Curley of a “blatant and illegal” breach of the Lotteries Act and dramatically sentenced him to three months in prison.On appeal just days later, he was given the Probation Acthe agreed to donate £, to St Vincent de Paul. Curley wrote a cheque for £, and walked out a free man with an estimated £m in his back pocket, for a house that was sold some years later for £,.Bernard Joseph Curley, who died last Sunday of cancer at his home in Newmarket, England at the age of , was born in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh. His parents were Catholic, but his father, a shopkeeper, was an “enthusiastic” gambler and drinker who often left the family in dire financial straits.Curley was educated at the Jesuit seminary of Mungret College, Limerick but left after falling ill with TB shortly before he was due to be ordained.“People were dying all around me like flies,” he said later. “There was not much to be scared about after that.”In his autobiography Giving a Little Back, he said he never held down a regular job. He ran a pub, went bust as a bookie, and then became a showband manager with Frankie McBride and the Polka Dots, getting them into the British charts in  with the slushy ballad, Five Little Fingers.At a gig in Killarney, he was introduced to Maureen Curley from St Helen’s in Lancashire, England and when they married, he estimated that given there were so few Curleys in the world their union was a  million to one shot.But it wasn’t all big paydays. He recalled nursing losses of £, after betting against Vincent O’Brien’s Golden Fleece, favourite for the  Epsom Derby. “My judgment just misfired completely,” he wrote. “A lesser man might have been persuaded to pack it in immediately, but I never panicked and I didn’t allow it to get to me. I took Maureen and the kidsto Calornia and effectively retired for three months.”After the Middleton Park raffle, he moved to Newmarket and took out a trainer’s licence. In his memoirs he said that he needed to make £, a year from gambling, just to keep the operation afloat — and there hadn’t been a year that he didn’t meet that target.In May  after two of his long-priced horses won at substantial odds a third, trained by his former assistant, was backed from   to   and landed a gamble that was said to have earned him in the region of €.m, although some online bookies refused to pay. He had another touch, making an estimated €.m in .One of his protégé’s, the jockey Frankie Dettori, conceded that Curley “got under people’s skin” but added that he was “a one-man band” who owned, trained, raced and gambled on his own horses.In later years most of his energies went into the charity, Direct Aid for Africain Zambia. Supported by Dettori, JP McManus and Sheikh Mohammad of Dubai he established it with a friend from his seminary days Fr James O’Kane, following the death of his -year-old son Charlie in a car accident in .He travelled to Africa regularly and said he got great solace and comfort from the work it did there, after his roller-coaster le as gambler, showman and thorn in the side of authority..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadI don#t think he#s laughing now: Christian Jessen to pay record damages over Arlene Foster  tweetTragedy as toddlerdies after car incident near his homeBelfast was the place blues legend Rab McCullough loved so much, mourners hearPoots stays tight-lipped on whether he’d accept Mass inviteFermanagh and South Tyrone DUP group express ‘disgust’ at removal of Arlene Foster as leaderTop VideosPlayVideo: Donkey gets emotional when reuniting with ownerPlay#Unionists have had to pay the price for Brexit# Cllr John Kyle tells NI committeePlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie saysSelf isolation requirement scrapped for movement within Common Travel AreaAntrim man who caused the death of his friend in a crash while on drink and drugs is jailed for seven yearsSame effort must be applied to tackling waiting lists as Covid: Michelle O’NeillDepartment of Health ‘committed’ to Northern Ireland abortion servicesLatestAC-’s latest recruits... a Line of Duty hen partyAutonomous vehicles join regular traffic in Cambridge in UK firstDrag queens walk the carpet at Death Drop’s West End reopeningAcademy sets a date for the  OscarsMy leadership will be ‘rough around the edges’, new UUP boss Doug Beattie says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

End to end swashbuckling football that turns the stomach inside out. Slaughtneils shoot-out with Kilcar in Omagh a few seasons back. Derrys win over Dublin in the  All-Ireland semi-final. Armagh and Kerrys blockbuster in the  All-Ireland Final are some that instantly jump onto this page. But championship is about so much more. It is about character and pulling a result from somewhere, like a rabbit from a hat. I think about Dungivens Ulster winning team of . Their performance against Errigal Ciaran that day in Clones was brilliant. It was a convincing win, but they nearly didnt get out of the first round of the championship in Derry that year. googletag.cmd.push In two nerve-tangling encounters at Drumsurn, they escaped from Glenullins clutches on the seat of their pants. Ruairi Boylans - nearly toppled them in the drawn game, before coming through by a point in a replay, their lowest winning margin of the season, second only to a two-point Ulster semi-final over St Pauls of Belfast. There are many others down the years, but when I think about the term championship team those two games in Drumsurn rush to the forefront of my mind. A team finding a way to win, Glenullin dying with their boots on. Chatting to Mark Lynch for a piece on Derrys encounters with Longford got me thinking. Are Derry really a qualier team  googletag.cmd.push More often than not, it was a sorry story from the house of pain. Before the qualiers began in , Derry were on the wrong end of two massive refereeing decisions. Henry Downeys perfectly time shoulder charge on Paddy McKeever yielded a free in as their Ulster semi-final with Armagh sat in the mixer, with the Orchard County going on to win the first of two Ulster titles. Then,  months later, they got another soft free – with BBC commentator and former Armagh legend Jimmy Smyth admitting as much on commentary – to go ahead before Anthony missed a chance to level the game from a free well outside the .     Sting through the championship records, I start to wonder how the mental scars couldve affected the county as a whole. Derrys runs to the All-Ireland Qualiers yielded the  tilt at Sam, only for running out of diesel coming down the final furlong of the infamous semi-final and Galways Matthew Clancy delivering a hammer blow. As the years went past, the challenge dwindled. The  season ended in a comprehensive enough defeat to Kerry in the semi-final. There was the high-octane battle against the Dubs in the  Quarter-Final and the defeat to Tipperary in the last- clash in Breffni in . Outside of that, Derrys championship record of the last  years is a reality check. Of the  championship games, there were  wins,  defeats and a sole draw, against Tyrone in , Mickey Hartes first game in charge. Derry have played  qualier games, winning . Of the  defeats, three were after extra time and the only extra time win was over Cavan in  at Celtic Park. Of the  victories, only the  win over Mayo and a one-point win over Armagh the same year jump out as scalps. The win over Monaghan in Clones two years later was of note. The rest, on paper, were games Derry were favourites in, including three wins from four against Cavan – the only county Derry havent faced over the last two decades in the Ulster championship. Then you have the Longford story with one win in four games. Add in two wins from four against Laois, another team Derry would fancy beating. In Ulster, Derry have won just  times in  games, with that one draw thrown in. On the face of it, the result looks grim, but scratch the surface and  of those games were against either Donegal or Tyrone. Of that,  were in the first round. The  win, under the baking sun in Ballybofey, was Derrys only win over Donegal in eight attempts. Of the eight clashes with Tyrone, the famous  win in Omagh, when the Red Hands were All-Ireland champions, is the only victory. In fairness, thats a tough series of draws. Five of the defeats to Donegal came in an era when they were jostling in the pecking order behind Dublin. The same can be said for Tyrone. But Glenullin wouldve been fair from Ulster club contenders in , yet couldve dumped Dungiven out on their ear. A team with the McKeevers, Brolly, McGilligan, goalkeeper Eoin McCloskey and rising star Paul Murphy. As Derry go into this years Ulster championship, they search for a first win in the competition since  and there is a decent chance it will be Donegal again. From looking back at the championship records, it changes the attitude on where Derry currently sit. Yes, there is a lot of talent coming along, but there is nothing that breeds growth like winning games. And especially when against the odds. I think back to Castlebar in . After being relegated from Division  and shipping a hammering by Tyrone in Ulster, Derry were seconds away from turning Mayo over. Conor Loftus bagged a goal to change the game and Derry went out with a whimper after extra-time. Two years later, in the Ulster championship opener in Omagh, Derry had Tyrone momentarily on the ropes. But after Shane McGuigans goal, they needed to attack the jugular even more. Darren McCurry had the ball in the net a matter of seconds later, as Tyrone outscored Derry - to -. Then there was last years game with Armagh. If Derry had got anything out of the first ten minutes, when they were all at sea, theyd have had a brilliant chance of victory. Thats three games and three massive uses of the word , but thats where Derrys future lies. Speaking before the start of this season, manager Rory Gallagher highlighted how Derry, in recent years, failed to win games that mattered. He mentioned championship and key relegation or promotion games. The manner of both league wins so far point to a team that can have a real cut at the Ulster championship on the other side of battling for promotion. Derry need to replicate Dungiven from that night in Drumsurn, in the  championship. By hook or by crook, find a way of turning performances into results.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just over a year before his tragic and untimely death, Karl dragged Ballinascreen to the  title, overturning their U final defeat at the hands of Banagher two years earlier. The restructuring of the age grades, away from U, means the rescheduled  meeting of Lavey and Dungiven will be the last time a trophy will be presented in Karls honour. Karl proudly wearing his Ballinascreen colours. googletag.cmd.push Fittingly, Fridays showdown will be played at Ballinascreen, but his legacy wont end there. A banner placed prominently along the new walking track at Dean McGlinchey Park will keep his memory burning brightly. Either side of Karls photo are images of his Ballinascreen jerseys, football and hurling. His hurl and boots, as well as his distinctive helmet are also pictured. The generations that follow, those too young to remember his performances in the maroon and white, will be forever reminded of Karl. He epitomised sport. His jovial character made a team more than about training and games. On the flip-side, youd want him in your corner when the chips were down. googletag.cmd.push Step back in time. With seven minutes of the  U final remaining, Gavin ONeills penalty levelled matters and it was time for someone to stand up and be counted. Ballinascreen had that somebody. His name was Karl McAuley. After powering upfield, he laid the ball off to Carlus McWilliams and one pass later Dean Flanagan slotted the ball beyond goalkeeper Daryl McDermott for the game-defining goal. Ballinascreen captain on the day was Karls best friend Alastair Clerkin. They grew up a mile apart, were in the same class at the nearby Straw Primary School and soldiered together on the same football teams.     Ironically Alastairs son was born on the anniversary of Karls death. Alastair would place flowers on Karls grave and is still a close friend of the family. Shortly after Karls death, Alastairs mother Bernie left a statue at the grave of two warriors battling for a high ball, which inspired the design of the model handed out to the dozen who followed in Karls footsteps as Man of the Match. It helped Karls spirit stand the test of time. The Mid-Ulster Observers report described his  final midfield performance as a Tour de Force.  The Mid Ulster Observer match report from the  U Final The year after Karls death, Derry minors first trial was at Ballinascreen where had been tipped to play a starring role and nail down a place on the . There was an impeccable minute silence in the clubs hall before an army of nervous and excited trialists embarked on a morning of football. But for that minute, there wasnt a sound. And there will be a lump in every Ballinascreen throat on Friday night when the final U Man of the Match follows in Karls footsteps. He played around the middle for Ballinascreen teams, somewhere he could shape a game from. Those who knew him best, coached him and played alongside him tipped him for a long career. “Karl was brilliant that day,” Clerkin recalls of his box to box U final performance. “He was just everywhere and making things happen...he covered every blade of grass. “He wouldve been very consistent, but in that game, he was on a dferent level by his own standards. It was one of those games when he stood up and dragged the team with him.” It was fitting that Karls spadework made the dference, in the pressure cooker of the closing stages. Clerkin paid him the highest compliment, calling him a big game player. A championship man. Martin Boyle, who coached that U team with Mickey ONeill and Jerome Bradley, said how Karl, in his finest hour, simply dragged his side to victory by refusing to accept a defeat that was staring them in the face. Outside of the white heat of battle, Karl didnt take himself too serious. At training, many wouldve been on the receiving end of his jokes. Then, asflicking a switch, hed put his game face on and deliver by the bucketful, when it mattered. “He was there primarily for the craic and to enjoy himself and he was quite good at football as it happened,” Clerkin adds. “Hed still be playing with all the lads he grew up with...you miss the craic you wouldve had with him.” The banner to be erected at Dean McGlinchey Park.

The Kilrea team, led by James Kielt, who went through their entire club underage careers unbeaten overcame Ballinascreen in the  Feacuteile final. “He was our best player that day at corner back and he was a year young,” Boyle remembers. Boyle is now the Derry minor manager, a team that includes Matthew Downey and Dan Higgins, the last two winners of the U final Man of the Match. “I told them just how special an award it is as Karl was such a special person and sportsman.” Like Clerkin, Boyle echoed Karls off the pitch qualities. “Karl made a lasting impression on everyone fortunate enough to come into contact with him,” Boyle said. “In a team environment he was a dream, brilliant for morale and craic among lads.” At school, he played on St Colms U Derry championship winning team of , their first in many years. When asked for a memory of Karl McAuley, their coach Ciaran Meenagh looked back on their Ulster clash with St Pauls Bessbrook. St Colms were leading by two points, as the game ticked into the last  minutes in a foggy winter afternoon. After an off the ball incident, the game  boiled over. Meenagh points to it as a scary moment for a typical  year-old. But not Karl, who won the hop ball, kicked two late points and alongside Anton Kelly, the pair stemmed the tide. “It was just indicative of his character and his backbone,” Meenagh states. “He was tough and had a savage temperament...he would have gone far...I’m sure of that. “He was just a super lad altogether, what a character. He had a brilliant heart on the field of play.” The McAuley family will feel Karls loss more than anyone. Theyll miss him every day. But, tucked amongst those emotions, they can take strength from how he rubbed off on others. Those who competed with and against him on the playing fields of Derry and beyond held him in the highest regard. Its fitting the last piece of the history from the Derry U football championship will be the presentation of Karls award, the final Tour de Force. Thats his legacy. He will never be forgotten.

Glentoran’s - margin of victory did not flatter them at the Brandywell last night, but Derry can take comfort from always being an attacking threat. With Northern Ireland Women’s manager, Kenny Shiels in attendance, Glentoran were keen to make an early impact on the game.  Derry struggled to contain the Glens midfield and the impressive Joely Andrews opened the scoring on seven minutes. googletag.cmd.push The away sides dominance and control on the game was strengthened on  minutes, when Rachel Rogan nipped in at the front post to double the visitors lead. Derry eventually settled but the contest was over on the half hour mark, when Kerry Beattie scored the first of the night’s contenders for goal of the game. Glentoran started the second half in a similar vein and Rogan got her second on  minutes. Derry maintained a threat however and Alison McGonagle pulled one back on  minutes, with a great strike from outside the box. The relief for Derry was short lived as Glens stalwart Kerry Baille, neatly restored the four goal margin a minute later, heading in from a corner. googletag.cmd.push Lauren Cregan’s tenacious lob of the keeper was unlucky not to go in on  minutes but in the aftermath, Paula McCrory sidestepped Shannon Dunne outside the Glentoran penalty area and unleashed a great shot that had Ashleigh McKinnon static in the Glentoran goal. A minute later, Alison McMaster again scored for the visitors. On  minutes, the final contender for goal of the game was a wonder strike from substitute Lauren Wade. The final twenty minutes required Derry to show strength and tenacity in the face of constant Glentoran attacks. Rogan quietly celebrated her hat-trick on  minutes and condemned Derry to a final score line of eight goals to two in favour of the visitors.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was impossible not to notice the atmosphere of optimism at the Lisnagelvin club recently as City of Derry re-opened after too long away, the cobwebs of covid shaken off by the camaraderie and revelry of those who have seen tough times before and come through it together. Unity has ed to the club after a few uncertain years, and as President Billy Jones greeted everyone, as Charlie McDaid walked around with his hands clasped behind his back ensuring everyone had what they needed, and as Treasurer Jim Ross sat and surveyed the club’swith satisfaction, one word sprang to mind – contentment. googletag.cmd.push Just being back at the club and back amongst friends was a huge step that the club has been waiting for, and with a brand-new competitive season approaching fast, the excitement was tangible. If anything, the cub has strengthened over the past year, with President Jones revealing that there have been over  new members joining City of Derry. “This marks the raising of the flag and I’m just delighted with the turnout,” he said. “The new members are playing with the well-established players and it’s great to have this confidence run through the club at the present time. We welcome anyone who is interested in the bowls to come up to City of Derry and you’ll be made most welcome. googletag.cmd.push “Last year, even Covid didn’t put the membership down it actually brought the membership up. More people were out and about. The garden centre is close by and I think people just put their head over the fence and seen that this was an activity that they could get into, so they came and joined us, and we were very fortunate that the numbers were so good.” There was also excited chatter about a few new star players who have joined the club… “We’re very lucky that people who have moved from other clubs have come joined us,” Billy explained. “The quality of player to come to us is very welcome and it’s very, very good for the future of City of Derry, and we have a good chance of playing for some cups in the IBA. The prospects we have would be very good this year and I’d be delightedwe could recognise some of the talent that’s in City of Derry.”      Freedom City of Derry is now in a position to play two teams in the upcoming league, and because of the signicant boost in numbers through new memberships, there is real hope of some silverware for a club that has always had the potential to go further. For former President and current Treasurer Ross, the club is about opportunity – for competition, for friendships, for peace of mind. “Last year we had no competitive bowls because of the lockdown, although we did play some friendly bowls amongst ourselves. It’s good to come up here and get a bit of freedom because it’s good for the mind,” he said. “This year we’re hoping the league will start at the end of May and the start of June. We have a club now with around  members, and we will likely have two teams in the league, an ‘A’ team and a ‘B’ team. Things are looking good,the virus continues the way it’s going. Most people here would be the older generation, although we have some new stars coming through here and we’re hoping to have a good season. “It does help with getting out and meeting with your friends and colleagues but we’re looking forward to competitive bowls again. That’s what it’s all about. It’s a great hobby. Fingers crossed it starts on schedule. This is our official opening day and we’ve had such a great turnout. The weather hasn’t been that good to us, but the turnout has been great.” Bowling has always been on the periphery of sport in Derry, a real niche market compared to the more glamourous sports that attract a large percentage of the youngsters in the city. Bowling is very much a generational game though and the potential to expand and grow is there more than ever for City of Derry. “Clubs like Ballymoney, Coleraine and Limavady have what they call an academy and they have young fellas coming from schools straight into the teams, but we don’t have that facility,” Jim continues. “We don’t have that facility here, but we would love to have it. It’s hard for us to attract the young people because most of us are the older generation, but we have one or two star players who are younger, andpeople see that we’re progressing we might draw more young people. In years gone by you could have played bowls in Derry seven days a week, especially indoor. We all enjoy the outdoors, and everyone is excited to get it open again and get it done. They are all waiting to see the teams picked so they can get into competitive bowls again.”  Mixed bowls for the first time For the first time in the club’s history, this year will see women integrated into the league, a recent law change permitting mixed teams, opening up yet another door for those who love the game. For Jim, this move only strengthens the club even further. “Women can now join our club and take part which wasn’t the case before,” he revealed. “We had a separate ladies’ team here but they were struggling for numbers. The governing bodies changed the rules and said that women can play with men now and take part in the leagues as equals That strengthens us, especiallyyou have a good lady bowler. We’re quite happy to have them. “Doors are opening that haven’t before, and of course we are all cross-community- it doesn’t matter what colour or what creed you are, we’re just happy to have you. If you can walk and throw a bowl then we want you. “We have some great new signings. We were never top of the league but we were always sort of in the middle of the league but I think this year we could have a very good year, and maybe even get a bit of silverware.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As well as being part of a major community development in Creggan which will bring the club’s facilities into the st century, the club have recently unveiled an U girls team, while their senior team heads into the Neal Carlin Cup final against Glack this weekend. Ciaran Wilkinson, part of the Dolan’s team which won the treble back in , is in as manager for the first time, and, following victories over Limavady Reserves, Drum and Faughanvale Reserves, they are just one game away from silverware. googletag.cmd.push It would be a nice way to begin a managerial career that ‘Wilkie’ never, ever saw coming. “I never thought about it but when your body doesn’t let you play anymore, it’s a close second,” he said. “I was just asked would I like to do it and I jumped at it, and got my team around me and that was it. “I’m enjoying the challenge to be honest. It’s nothing compared to playing, but I’m enjoying it. It’s still very early and things are going well, but it always is when you are getting results. It’s only pre-season, it’s not the league or the Championship, but it’s going alright.” googletag.cmd.push Ciaran has his own ideas of how he wants to manage, insisting he wants to change the mindsets of the players to help them realise their potential. “I want boys to believe in their own ability and back themselves,” he explained. That was me as a player no matter who you are up against in that ision, you have to back yourself, so it’s just a matter of getting the players to believe that they are good enough and against anyone in that ision, they’ll give them a game not to fear anybody andyou approach every game like that you have a good a chance as they do.”     Glack are tomorrow night’s opponents, reaching Celtic Park by defeating Craigbane Reserves, Magilligan and Steelstown Reserves. Whilst the silverware would be nice, there is something more important for the new Dolans manager. “I just want them to enjoy it more than anything,” he admitted. “You don’t get to finals every whiparound. I never enjoyed it much as a player, soanything, I’m hoping to get the players to enjoy it win, lose or draw. That’s why we’re playing the game at the end of the day it’s not always about winning. Of course, it would be nice to win, and it’s better when you’re winning, but I’m just drilling it into them to enjoy it. I didn’t win anything until I was almost finished, and I wish I had enjoyed it more, soI can get them to enjoy it, without us focusing on the win, I’ll be happy enough with that to be honest.”  Notable addition A notable addition to the Dolans coaching staff this year is that of Ciara McGurk, someone who knows all about winning due to her success in recent years for both club and county. Still a player with Steelstown, Ciara has now stepped into the coaching side of the game, and such is her reputation in the game, that Wilkinson sees it as a huge benefit to have her as part of the team. The addition of a female coach at senior level adds something dferent he believes. “Ciara is there on merit,” he said. “I have watched her up close and from afar and she’s a great coach. She’s passionate and she brings a set of skills to the table. There’s not many people around the town has that experience or those medals. It’s great. I didn’t even have to think about it when I was asked. It was just about thinking outside the box, and she’s capable, and the fact that she’s a girl didn’t even come into it. It’s what she brings to it and she’s there on merit.” Geoffrey McGonigle, manager of the  treble-winning team, has also agreed toto the coaching set-up at Dolans, meaning there is no shortage of winning experience at the club this year.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

So far, they have contributed pound, to the project which has allowed us to go the extra mile with more extensive resources and a very high spec finish in the ious areas.He said that the welcome garden was created almost exclusively by volunteers such as grandparent Stephen Vaughan, who built the planter boxes, the garden furniture was designed and constructed by brothers Lawrence and Gareth Blaney, the circular stone planter built by parent Fergus Rooney , grounds work was carried out by Pascal Magee and planting by Bill Carew. Plants and shrubs were provided at a discounted rate from Cunningham Flowers in Dundrum.The schoolrsquos head of outdoor education, Sean McReynolds, oversaw the project with building supervisors Brian Tweedie and Bill Carew, classroom assistant Ryan Craig and Gemma Vaughan, the schoolrsquos eco co-ordinator.Parent Roisin McKenna, who along with Andrea McMenamin, Natasha Shields and Rosaleen Cunlfe leads the PTFA committee, said that they had enjoyed ldquoamazing support from parents, the wider school community and local businesses.Roisin said: ldquoThe ethos of our PTFA is about \"making memories\" and this is always at the forefront of our fundraising. We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Access should only be restrictedany confidential information is discussed. If any person considers that access to meetings is being restricted unnecessarily, their first step should be to approach the council with these concerns.But access remained denied, so the Minister was asked to amend legislation around this sticking point.A spokesperson replied: ldquoGiven legislation currently allows public press access to committees and subcommittees subject to the exclusions previously advised, the Department is not at this time considering making amendments.This was shared with councillors, with all who replied commenting positively around press attendance.Councillor Barry McElduff, Sinn Fein formally called for press to be permitted access to Health Group meetings and Chief Executive Alison McCullagh suggested this could be achieved by upgrading to subcommittee status.Following unanimous agreement in December, BBC Local Democracy enquired when this could be expected, and were advised it was part of an ongoing review.The matter arose last week, and what started out as a victory for democracy, quickly dwindled when members learned upgrading meant quota rules of membership would apply.Councillor Emmet McAleer, Independent suggested retaining working group status, but opening meetings to public and press, but the Chair Councillor Stephen McCann replied: ldquoThat conversation has been had a number of times and we are aware why that cannot happen. However it was given extra clout as a subcommittee, I understand the press would have access. That would address some concerns members have raised in the past.The Chief Executive stressed: ldquoThe only dference is Standing Orders apply in subcommittees, therefore press and public would have normal access.Current Health Group member Councillor Donal OrsquoCofaigh, Independent, acknowledged subcommittee status would cost him his place under the quota, but nonetheless was willing to agreeit meant public and press access.SDLP Councillor Mary Garrity said: ldquoIf itrsquos not legislatively enforceable, we come upon this quandary, whether we like it or not.However she felt working group status meant reporting back to full council and: ldquoAbsent the press, we would still get all our concerns highlighted.The Chief Executive confirmed: ldquoActions would be reported, irrespective of working group or subcommittee status.Councillor Josephine Deehan, Independent found it: ldquoRegrettable we didnrsquot have information regarding legislative requirements prior to making this decision. Irsquom concerned that members of small parties and independents would be excluded. I strongly believe in inclusion and as elected members we have a duty to represent our constituents.She added: ldquoTherersquos not a huge amount of dference between a subcommittee and a working group. In terms of involving the press and public, we would have the opportunity to raise issues at standing committees.Proposing retention of the current working group status to ensure inclusivity and current membership, Councillor Deehan said: ldquoThe only dference is access to the public and press hellipRepresentation and input from members is more important and should be the greater priority.This was seconded by Councillor Garrity.Councillor McElduff requested clarity around press access noting: ldquoObviously where possible, when we arenrsquot talking about issues which are confidential, wersquod want to err on the side of openness and transparency.The Chief Executive pointed to legislation in which: ldquoThere is no provision for press or public to attend working group meetings.Councillor Adam Gannon, SDLP noted the Health Group was: ldquoLooked at to change into a subcommittee because some members wanted it opened to the press. Whilst it would be nice to have public access to everything, it may not always happen and canrsquot always be that way.Concluding the discussion, he said whatever the status of the group: ldquoThe work is still being done. It would be nice for the public to be present, but we donrsquot need the press there to do our work. I know I donrsquot.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He notes the view seen from his home on the shores of Belfast Lough. The Mull of Gallowayless than  miles away. The Mournes, some  miles away. Holywood where John, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Earl of Anjou, stayed a night in  after crossing the Lough from Carrickfergus Castle built in  by the Norman, John de Courcy. The sailors who had brought the king from Bayonne, long before nation states had come into being, were tipped  shillings.He notes the Castlereagh Hills without mentioning Robert Stewart at  a member of the Irish Parliament for Down, who when ennobled as Viscount Castlereagh took his title from the hills near his home.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...He had shown leanings towards the Belfast United Irishmen – enough for the founder, William Drennan, to see in him a young hopeful. A visit to France and what he saw of the aftermath of the French Revolution changed Stewart’s mind. He saw the choice for the ills of the Kingdom of Ireland either a parliamentary union with Great Britain or incorporation into the French Napoleonic Empire, for French troops once landed in Ireland would never leave. An opponent of Castlereagh and the proposed Union was the Marquis of Downshire, a prominent Orangeman.Castlereagh failed to achieve all he had hoped for in the Union . But Belfast was able to take advantage of access to new markets the Union opened and grew from some , inhabitants into an industrial city of over , a century later.Castlereagh became British Foreign Secretary – admired today by Henry Kissinger and William Hague for diplomatic skills as a negotiator at the Congress of Vienna aimed at keeping the peace in Europe. His home in County Down is now a National Trust property.Alexander Stewart, Castlereagh’s grandfather was an elder in what at the time would have been Rosemary Street Meeting House, today’s Rosemary Street Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church.His son John, the father of Castlereagh, conformed to the Church of Ireland making possible the election of his son Robert to the Irish parliament.On a wall close by the church a Blue Plaque notes William Drennan’s birthplace and the history column in the street outside the church records his United Irishmen connection but has no note, surely somewhat odd, given the tourists, of the Stewarts, Castlereagh’s family links.But then neither does the history notes in front of St Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church in Donegall Street record that Castlereagh was amongst the subscribers to the building cost of the earlier chapel on the site.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  local people are urging the Cardf and Vale University Health Boardto build a health centre on Eagleswell Road, where a former primary school closed in .The disused plot of land is currently owned by Vale of Glamorgan council, and is allocated for  potential houses in the local development plan.But campaigners want the council to allow the health board to build a new health centre there, complaining the townrsquos current surgeries arenrsquot up to scratch.Councillor Gwyn John, of the Llantwit First Independent party, is organising the petition. He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.
