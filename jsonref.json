So if you\u0027ve seen the original movie, you\u0027ll know what comes next.For the first film, the action was set in Edwardian London in 1910. For the sequel, it takes place in the capital in 1934.Mary is called back to help her former charge Michael Banks, now a father-of-three, played by Ben Whishaw, who is despondent over the death of his wife and money problems which means he risks losing their home.Also helping to care for his children is his sister Jane, played by Emily Mortimer, who takes after her campaigning suffragette mother by becoming a union activist.When Michael dumps his old kite in the bin, it is picked up by his youngest son Georgie, who flies it the park nearby — only to bring it down to earth with Mary Poppins attached.For Mary\u0027s grand re-entrance, costume designer Sandy Powell says it was essential that the character\u0027s new reincarnation cut a recognisable silhouette.\u0027You\u0027re trying to do another version of an iconic look. And, in a way, her character can\u0027t change too much as she\u0027s always the same person like Peter Pan or James Bond.\u0027To bring her up to date, Mary\u0027s skirt has a shorter hemline, she wears a double cape made of cobalt blue and carries a carpet bag with a Thirties Art Deco design.Sandy says: \u0027Traditionally, a nanny\u0027s coat would have been navy blue, but I wanted Mary to add brightness to a dark, grey world\u0027.Despite her dainty landing, Emily Blunt admitted she was terrified while filming the arrival scene because of her fear of heights.Emily says: \u0027I was 50ft in the air and so scared. As I landed, one of the camera guys came up and said: \u0027I got really choked watching you arrive there.\u0027\u0027It reminded me people really need a film and a moment like this. Maybe we didn\u0027t realise how much we wanted Mary to come back.\u0027WHY JULIE TURNED DOWN £1 MILLION TO APPEAR          When Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than study the original film again she read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books insteadWhen Surrey-born Emily Blunt took the part, she wanted to make it her own. Rather than studying the original film again — which she hadn\u0027t seen since she was a child — Blunt read author P.L. Travers\u0027s original eight books instead.Emily, 35, says: \u0027I decided not to be intimidated by Julie Andrews in the iconic role, and just approached it as I would any other part. No one is going to out-do Julie Andrews.\u0027Blunt found a different side to the nanny in the books, written in Thirties and Forties — \u0027a little more acerbic and vain and weird\u0027.Indeed it\u0027s a portrait the Australian-born Travers would probably have preferred, having loathed the saccharine portrayal of her creation in the first film.Emily was the only actress approached to reprise the role made famous by Sound Of Music Star Julie Andrews, now 83.And, despite a rumoured offer of over £1 million to make a cameo, Julie Andrews turned down the invitation.Director Rob Marshall says: \u0027Julie was incredibly gracious, but she made it clear right up front.\u0027She said: \u0027I really want it to be Emily\u0027s show. I really want her to take this and run with it, because she will be brilliant.\u0027 \u0027However only two members of the original onscreen Banks family survive — Glynis Johns, who is now 95, who played Mrs Banks, and Karen Dotrice, now 63, was her daughter Jane.David Tomlinson, who was strict father George Banks in the original, died in 2000 aged 83, while Matthew Garber who played his mischievous son Michael died age 21 in 1977 after catching hepatitis during a trip to India.THE MOST FAMOUS ADDRESS IN CHILDREN\u0027S BOOKS          In the original, Dick Van Dyke played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks. Now the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s sonAmerican actor Dick Van Dyke\u0027s cockney accent as a London chimney sweep has gone down in film history for all the wrong reasons.Indeed, the actor himself has branded it the worst ever, claiming that his vocal coach was Irish and didn\u0027t know how to do one himself.          Van Dyke spent two days on set often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songsDick, now 92, says: \u0027People in the UK love to rib me about that accent. They ask what part of England I was meant to be from and I say it was a little shire in the North where most of the people were from Ohio.\u0027In the original, Van Dyke also played doddery old banker Mr Dawes Sr, who employs Michael Banks.Now that\u0027s he\u0027s hung up his chimney brush, the actor reprises the role, this time as Mr Dawes\u0027s son, who would now be the same age — so this time Van Dyke needed no make-up to age him.Van Dyke spent two days on the set of the film, often bringing cast members like Emily Blunt to tears by singing snippets of the original songs.FROM CHIMNEY SWEEP TO LAMPLIGHTER          Meryl Streep joins the new cast as cousin Topsy Tartlet. She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a TuesdayIn the original film, Mary\u0027s only relative was Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), who laughs so much he floats on the ceiling.For this outing, she is joined by her cousin, Topsy Tartlet, played by Meryl Streep.She has a fix-it shop in which everything, from grand pianos to china and statues, turns upside down on a Tuesday.As a result, the Oscar-winning actress performs her song Turning Turtle upside down from a chandelier.Designers say her shop was the most challenging of the 50 sets to build.Topsy\u0027s costume — inspired by Bohemian poet Edith Sitwell — was also the hardest to make and based on a pair of Twenties vintage pyjamas and a kimono.For three weeks, a team of ten textile artists bleached the material before hand-painting it with Art Deco patterns of orange, pink, turquoise and yellow.To complete the look, Streep asked for a vibrant orange wig cut into bob which was topped off with a green turban and curtain tassles for earrings.THE BATH THAT BECOMES AN UNDERWATER ADVENTURE          Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) go on a series of adventures in the filmJust as they did in the first film, Mary and the Banks children Georgie (Joel Dawson), Anabel (Pixie Davies) and John (Nathanael Saleh) — embark on a series of Technicolor-style fantasy adventures.One of the most beloved in the first film was when the characters jumped into Bert\u0027s chalk pavement pictures to discover a magical world where they interact with cartoon characters.And rather than use computer-generated images, the makers returned to traditional hand-drawn animation, a technique not employed in a Disney movie for nearly ten years.However in other parts of the film, computer animation is used when a dolphin beckons the children into the bath tub — and leads them to an underwater fantasia.The mix of special effects and live action meant that, although the live filming only took four months, Mary Poppins Returns spent more than a year in post-production, as long as a science fiction movie.RETURN TO A VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL          In one scene in which the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside itWhen the children break a Royal Doulton bowl, Mary decides the only way to fix it is to disappear inside it.She spins the bowl around, creating a whirlwind that transports them within.Once there, Mary Poppins picks up her umbrella, and turns it to create a tent which turns into a Victorian music hall where Jack and Mary put on a show — with dozens of dressed-up cartoon animals in the audience.Hollywood film star and cricket hero are named among 35...Share this articleTo help the character fit with the animated creations, costume designer Sandy Powell says they wanted to make the humans\u0027 clothing look two-dimensional, as if had also been drawn by the animators.The outfits were then made out of canvas-like material which was hand-painted with details like collars, buttons and bows.Sandy Powell says: \u0027I wanted the effect on all of these costumes to look like watercolour on paper with the white coming through.\u0027THE RETURN OF THE PENGUINS          In the new movie the dapper bow-tied  penguins return once more. At the time of the original movie it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animationThe scene where Dick Van Dyke as Bert performs a tap dance with a group of four bow-tied penguin waiters was one of the most beloved from the original movie.At the time it was a pioneering move to combine live action and animation — shot against a bright yellow, rather than green, screen — which was so hard on the eyes that the actor reported he couldn\u0027t see by the end of the day.Now the dapper penguins have returned once more — named after Hollywood legends, (Fred) Astaire, (Oliver) Hardy, (Cary) Grant and (Charlie) Chaplin — to perform a music hall number with Mary and Jack.As well as some of the favourites from the original movie, the film also features nine new songs written by the same team who wrote the musical Hairspray, but which are intended to sound as if they could have been written in 1964.Although she has to match the legendary singing voice of Julie Andrews, Emily Blunt also has no problem holding a musical note.Before she became an actress, she was considering career as singer until she was spotted in a school production performing at the Edinburgh Festival.A LOVE LETTER TO LONDON          The film include\u0027s so many of London\u0027s landmarks- from areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham PalaceThe film has been called a \u0027love letter to London\u0027, because it includes so many of the city\u0027s landmarks.Areas outside the Bank of England and also Buckingham Palace were taken over during night shoots by hundreds of extras on vintage bikes and buses borrowed from the London Transport Museum.To add to the atmosphere, mist was used to look like a pre-war fog.However, actor Lin-Manuel Miranda said using the iconic locations piled on the pressure to get the scenes right first time: \u0027The adrenaline was pumping. You\u0027re never coming back to Buckingham Palace to get a second take.\u0027Throughout the film, the set is built on many levels to show as many dancers as possible during the musical numbers.To perfect the scenes, the actors and dancers rehearsed for eight weeks to get every move perfect — even though in some scenes they had to interact with cartoon partners who were not added until after.Miranda says they had to work with instructions such as: \u0027The penguin is going to be heavier holding on to your cane. Can you show us that?\u0027In order to recreate a scene with Big Ben for the climax, the filmmakers built a giant recreation of the clock face in a studio — all to scale, after making set visits to Westminster to see how it worked close-up.Production designer John Myhre says: \u0027The clock face and sections of the tower are completely authentic and an exact reproduction of what is behind the clock face. It\u0027s a little bit of movie magic.\u0027 Mary Poppins Returns is released in the UK on Friday, December 21."},{"url":null,"title":"Ted Baker boss Ray Kelvin asked 17 year old girl legal","story":"Ted Baker founder Ray Kelvin (pictured) asked \u0027if it was legal\u0027 to take a 17-year-old female employee \u0027into the fitting room\u0027, a former manager at the fashion store has alleged.

It could be voted down on TuesdayTuesday, the day the Commons votes on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal, is being framed as the moment of her downfall. It could well be. But, much more significantly, it is also shaping up to be the moment of the Remainers\u0027 greatest triumph.  The instant the Commons formally begins the process of erasing the verdict of the British people, and calling a halt to Brexit.That is not how committed Leavers see it, of course. They believe this is their finest hour. \u0027We can\u0027t give in to tyranny,\u0027 one anti-Chequers rebel told me, \u0027this is like 1939. We have to stand up to the EU. We can\u0027t surrender.\u0027The hardcore Tory Brexiteers may not be surrendering. But they are falling into a trap – a brilliantly planned and executed trap by those they have complacently dismissed as the Remoaners.   The former Labour leader Tony Blair said there is no point in just running head-on into a defeat and that he would pull the vote if he was still in No10It was first laid before the celebratory champagne of June 23, 2016 had even grown warm. Gina Miller, a hitherto anonymous investment-fund manager, walked into the offices of London law firm Mishcon de Reya and asked it to prepare a legal challenge to Article 50. The House of Commons, not the Government, should have the final say on the course of Brexit, she argued.Brexiteers decried her action as frivolous, attention-seeking. Then, incomprehensibly, they embraced her central argument. As recently as June, Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote: \u0027Calls for MPs to have a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit are nothing to do with parliamentary scrutiny they are about stopping Brexit.\u0027And yet on Tuesday he will march through the No lobby to derail a Brexit deal in that self-same \u0027meaningful\u0027 vote. Meanwhile, the advocates of the self-styled People\u0027s Vote are pinching themselves. \u0027When we launched our campaign we were told it was pie in the sky,\u0027 one MP told me.           Gina Miller argued that the Commons, not the Government, should have the final say on Brexit\u0027But we\u0027ve had two major marches, a million signatures, and now we\u0027ve got MPs from all parties saying, when her vote falls, they\u0027re going to back a new referendum.\u0027Crucially, they have also secured the unwitting support of their opponents. The Remainers believed they would have to starve out the supporters of Brexit by delaying and frustrating the process until eventually the British people said: \u0027We give up, leave things as they are.\u0027But not only are hardcore Brexiteers joining them in these wrecking tactics, they have also become the most vocal critics of all they once passionately championed. \u0027Staying would be better than the Brexit deal.\u0027 \u0027The Brexit deal will leave the British people even worse off than the status quo.\u0027 These aren\u0027t the arguments of Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry, but Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson.And their arguments are hitting home – if not in the way they intended. \u0027Next week we\u0027re going to reach the tipping point,\u0027 a Remainer MP predicted. \u0027When May loses, we\u0027re going from a second referendum being at best a 50:50 proposition to the most likely outcome.\u0027    Theresa May speaks to the Commons in this week\u0027s Parliamentary Question Time, ahead of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027. On Tuesday the Commons will vote on her Brexit dealSlowly and carefully the Remain chess pieces have been moved into place. Establishing the primacy of the parliamentarians over the people. Creating and embedding a narrative in which the reversal of Brexit becomes possible, then probable. And on Tuesday they intend to remove their opponents queen, and position themselves for checkmate.For the past few weeks May has been alive to this danger. \u0027It\u0027s my deal, no deal or no Brexit,\u0027 she has warned. And she is right. Because it is here the Brexiteers have made their most staggering blunder.\u0027Reject May\u0027s deal, and we can get a better one,\u0027 they argue – playing right into the EU\u0027s hands.\u0027They don\u0027t understand what they\u0027re doing,\u0027 a No 10 official raged. \u0027They actually think if they hammer the PM by 100 votes the EU will roll over and give them what they want. The opposite will happen. If they kill the deal, the EU will be licking their lips.\u0027\u0027He wanted me to have an abortion\u0027: Mother-of-one claims her...Eight of Britain\u0027s most elite schools sent 1,310 students to...Share this articleOf course they will. As will their Remainer allies. They know that if May\u0027s deal is scuppered, they can rebuff any demand for a harder Brexit – leaving only two options on the table. No Deal and No Brexit. And they know there is no way Parliament will countenance a No Deal Brexit. That was demonstrated by arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve\u0027s amendment, which handed MPs a fresh meaningful vote on a Plan B if May\u0027s deal is rejected.\u0027That amendment was the Tory Party\u0027s moderate wing putting the Brexiteers on notice,\u0027 a Downing Street official explained to me. \u0027If the Brexiteers defeat the deal and bring the PM down, the moderates will go to war. They won\u0027t stop until Rees-Mogg and his chums are crying into their cornflakes.\u0027 They might well end up weeping into their cereal. The problem is, the rest of the country could end up joining them. On this the hardcore Brexiteers are right.     As recently as June, Jacob Rees-Mogg wrote: \u0027Calls for MPs to have a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit are nothing to do with parliamentary scrutiny they are about stopping Brexit\u0027If the will of the people as expressed in 2016 is reversed, the consequences are incalculable. The repudiation of a popular vote, which was itself a repudiation of the arrogance and aloofness of the political class, could lead us to catastrophe.On the streets of Paris the protesters have been expressing their disgust in all politicians, and calling for the appointment of the former head of the military, General Pierre de Villiers. It is not impossible to imagine the Gilets Jaunes movement being transposed across the channel into the Gilets Rouges, Blancs et Bleus.In the opening of the Brexit debate last week, there was a significant moment. Boris Johnson rose, and with characteristic panache, began to set about the Government\u0027s deal. \u0027It has achieved an extraordinary thing,\u0027 he proclaimed. \u0027It has finally brought us together. Remainers and Leavers, myself and Tony Blair, we are united.\u0027They are indeed. Tony Blair is cheering Boris on. So is Gina Miller. And Peter Mandelson. And Alastair Campbell. Each and every Remainer is willing him to send Mrs May and her Government down to defeat. Before Boris and his colleagues walk through those ision lobbies next Tuesday, perhaps they should take a moment to pause and ask themselves why.  Now Sir Humphrey tries to kill BrexitIt\u0027s not just MPs rebelling against Mrs May\u0027s Brexit deal.

Prince William and Kate SKIP a board...Share this articleThis is just his fourth interview since the fall-out with Harry and Meghan after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor.Today, in a wide-ranging interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle, for the first time, categorically rejects some of the most ‘grievous’ lies against him and produces evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth:          They are the words of love from a daughter who clearly adores her father. In a Valentine\u0027s card, Meghan writes: \u0027Daddy, Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. ‘All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – her childhood nickname‘Everything has been met with a stony silence. Their silence means people continue to attack me and write lies about me.’Mr Markle says he has been surprised by a spate of recent negative stories about his daughter that portray her as a petulant a.One claimed she reduced a staff member to tears with her 5am demands and another said she wanted to spray air freshener around ‘musty’ St George’s Chapel – a request rejected by the Queen.Perhaps the most damaging claim concerns an alleged rift between Meghan and Kate, who is said to have been ‘reduced to tears’ by Meghan’s demands over Princess Charlotte’s bridesmaid gown and who later, allegedly, reprimanded Meghan for ‘berating’ a member of her staff.Kate is said to have told Meghan: ‘That’s unacceptable. They’re my staff and I speak to them.’Meghan’s father says he is baffled by the reports. ‘I don’t recognise this person,’ he says, shaking his head. ‘The Meghan I know was always sweet, kind, generous. She was always demanding but never rude. I don’t want to say or do anything to hurt my daughter but I worry she is going to hurt herself.’And in a Christmas card, left, showing a colourful llama, she writes: ‘Because you have always been so generous with me… it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’ Inside was a gift of $2,000 for a holidayMr Markle, a retired Emmy award-winning Hollywood lighting director, adds: ‘Meghan grew up on set. I taught her to have respect for the crew. They can make you look good or awful. I don’t pretend to know what she’s like now.‘She bends the rules. She’s good at that. But this acting up is new. She’s never been rude to me before. I can’t believe I’ve done anything severe enough to be treated this way by her.’ Indeed, he believes his bond with Meghan is ‘unbreakable’ – a point illustrated by two cards from his treasured collection.Meghan trained as a calligrapher and wrote wedding invitations to help support herself through the early days of her acting career, a skill highlighted in her cards to her father, which are written in elegant cursive script.‘I loved getting cards from Meghan,’ Mr Markle says. ‘She wrote me hundreds of little cards and notes through the years. Sometimes they were for special occasions, other times just little notes she would leave around the house. I’ve still got a Post-It Note on my fridge which says, “I love you Daddy.” I see it every day. I got a card every Valentine’s Day.’ He pulls one Valentine’s card from a manila folder. It shows a picture of a chubby baby holding a daffodil with a touching message: ‘Daddy… I don’t express as often as I should how much you mean to me. Everything you do for me has turned me into who I am and I am so grateful. All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it. Thank you for everything daddy. I love you with all of my heart now and forever. Love Bean’ – a reference to his childhood nickname for her.    Mr Markle suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor when she married Prince Harry - who he is yet to meetOver the years, Mr Markle ‘willingly’ spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on his daughter, sending her to private school and even cashing in Facebook shares to help pay for her first wedding.A Christmas card showing a llama and the words ‘Fa-La-La Llama’ arrived at Mr Markle’s Mexican home just a couple of years ago, by which time Meghan was a successful actress, earning $50,000 (£40,000) an episode on the hit TV show Suits. The card contained $2,000 for him to put towards a holiday. She wrote: ‘Daddy, Because you have always been so generous with me and taken the best care of me it brings me so much joy to be able to give you this this Christmas. I love you to no end. Meg.’For Mr Markle, the prospect of never speaking to his daughter again is unbearable: ‘I’m hurt by what’s happened but I’m not going to stay silent.          In a wide-ranging interview with Caroline Graham near his home in Mexico, Mr Markle revealed the anguish he feels at the thought of never seeing his daughter again‘My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry. When they announced her pregnancy I had seven paparazzi on my doorstep night and day for seven days. They rented the house next door.‘Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.‘I’m trolled on the internet by one guy who sits in his mother’s basement spewing lies about me. Twitter is the worst but I can’t avoid it.‘I don’t read things but then people send them to me anyway. They say I faked my heart attacks, that I wasn’t at the first wedding. It’s all bull****. Meghan and I never had any problems before this.‘If she would just speak to me, things could be different. I love Meghan very much. I want her and Harry to have a beautiful, healthy baby and a great life.‘But I want them to stop believing the lies.’Does he believe he and Meghan will ever be reunited?He shrugs. ‘Maybe. Some day.’  \u0027I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown\u0027: Thomas Markle unveils touching photograph that proves he DID go to his daughter\u0027s first wedding but said no to the party bag marijuana He was reduced to what he calls ‘a footnote in history’ when two heart attacks prevented him from walking his daughter Meghan down the aisle of St George’s Chapel amid the pomp and pageantry of the Royal Wedding in May.But Thomas Markle did take a starring role at Meghan’s very different first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson in 2011, which took place under swaying palm trees on a Jamaican beach, complete with a Caribbean steel drum band and a most unusual welcome gift for the guests.Mr Markle says he is ‘sick and tired’ of reading erroneous reports that he failed to attend the wedding, which sadly ended in orce for the couple two years later. He explains that he asked the photographer to ignore him and concentrate on the young people showing off their beautiful bodies in swimwear.          The invitationto Meghan’s first wedding showed her entwined with Trevor on a beach with a beer‘There are no pictures out there of me at the wedding because it was on the beach and everyone else was in their 30s and I was in my 60s’, Mr Markle said last night, before showing The Mail on Sunday a photograph – published here for the first time. It shows him posing proudly with Meghan just moments before he and his ex-wife Doria walked her across the sand to marry Trevor.Mr Markle also kept his business-class ticket to the four-day affair, along with an invitation, which featured a picture of a bikini-wearing Meghan on the beach entwined in Trevor’s arms, and a chilled bottle of Red Stripe beer within arm’s reach.The wedding took place at the famous Jamaica Inn, where Meghan booked all 55 rooms and villas, taking the £1,200-a-night largest villa for herself and her new husband.‘Meghan planned everything down to the tiniest detail. She took control of everything. I was given a white shirt to wear, as were all the male guests. She micro-managed everything,’ says Mr Markle.‘The picture was taken when I walked into her bungalow just moments before the ceremony was due to start. I was so proud and overcome with emotion to see my baby in a white gown, looking so beautiful. We took the picture and then Doria and I both walked her down the aisle.‘Trevor is Jewish and his father, who is a rabbi, conducted the service. But it was not a traditional Jewish ceremony. Meghan read vows she’d written herself.’          Prince Harry severely berated Mr Markle after he posed for photos before the royal wedding - contributing to their riftEach heartfelt word reveals the true sentiments of a devoted daughter. Meghan’s love for Thomas Markle is as plain as day.Yet today he is a pariah. At 74, in failing health in his twilight years, he is spending Christmas ostracised by his daughter. Heartbroken, cut off and cast out into the cold by an angry and indignant Meghan.The irony will be lost on the new Duchess of Sussex, as she fine-tunes her favoured philanthropic causes, that charity, as the saying goes, should begin at home. But to her, Thomas has become an embarrassment and a rolling public humiliation.Unable to manage and control him, she has pulled up the drawbridge. Behind the castle walls she will not – cannot – be reached. While Thomas feels wounded, Meghan feels betrayed. She is unwilling to climb down from the battlements. Meghan’s Royal ambition is leaving a large and untidy wake.She has in the past been accused of using people and then quickly moving on up the ladder, never looking back.It may be harsh to say she’s ‘ghosting’ her father – the fashionable term used when someone cuts off all communication without warning or explanation. Thomas prefers to describe her behaviour as ‘acting up’. But what’s certain is that she has approached her new Royal life at full tilt, head down, powering through.As Thomas says: ‘She was a control freak but never in a bad way – she was always sweet and kind.’Meghan’s marriage to Prince Harry wasn’t simply falling in love – although that was the main impetus – it was a life transformation of unimaginable proportions.A girl raised in a series of Los Angeles apartment blocks, who reinvented herself as a successful TV actress, is now reinventing herself as a princess.Since joining the House of Windsor her personal style has got more regal and refined. She has made sure social issues are front and centre of her public persona, like her high-profile cookbook launch to help Grenfell survivors with mum Doria in tow. And, of course, she plays the Royal wife with aplomb, as we have seen on the couple’s dazzling tour to Australia and New Zealand. She is, as one source says, ‘putting everything into this’. And as Thomas observes, his perfectionist daughter has always liked to micro-manage her life.Meghan knew her arrival in the Royal circle would be tricky. A orcee, a woman with history, there was always the chance of a disgruntled ex speaking out.What no one expected – and what has repeatedly wrong-footed Palace officials – is that it would be her immediate family who would prove to be the headache.While Doria has been the personification of discretion, Meghan views her father’s meandering outbursts during this critical time as a reminder of where she came from – not where she’s going. And right now, she finds it unforgivable. A post she shared on her old lifestyle blog The Tig gives a telling insight into how she deals with such ‘negative experiences’.She quoted Portuguese life coach José Micard Teixeira, who wrote: ‘I no longer have patience for certain things, not because I’ve become arrogant, but simply because I reached a point in my life where I do not want to waste more time with what displeases me or hurts me. I lost the will to please those who do not like me, to love those who do not love me and to smile at those who do not want to smile at me.’This philosophy still drives Meghan’s thinking and has been firmly applied to her father’s behaviour.From day one she has appeared to play favourites with her parents – Doria got an official Palace scroll announcing their wedding, Thomas didn’t. Doria was formally invited to the nuptials, Thomas wasn’t. And he was very hurt when told he couldn’t make a speech at the reception.In most family feuds, it takes a third party – a husband or partner – to intervene, break the entrenched positions and tactfully suggest the offer of an olive branch might be the best way forward.Harry should have been that peacemaker. But headstrong, unworldly and in thrall to his starry, beautiful wife he did nothing to calm the brewing storm.Rather than respectfully meeting his father-in-law face to face before the couple’s engagement was announced, he chose a quick chat on the phone. Harry – or rather his advisers – had the chance to bring Thomas into the Royal tent before the world even knew Meghan and Harry were a couple. It was a dropped ball that has led us to this point.When, only days before the wedding, Thomas foolishly agreed to stunt some photographs, Harry was on the phone again, this time to severely berate him. Thomas, recovering from urgent heart surgery and deeply embarrassed by his actions, pulled out of his daughter’s big day. Some Royal insiders suggested he faked the surgery to find an excuse, but, as we reveal today, it actually saved his life.For Meghan, the joy of her Windsor Castle wedding shared by the world was a chance to put all the unpleasantness behind her. She decided to take a ‘time out’ from her Dad, but neglected to communicate that to him properly. Once again, he felt hurt and slighted and reacted angrily in a live TV interview.Right now it’s hard to see Meghan giving ground. Just in practical terms she is heavily pregnant, working with interior designers and armed with swatch fabric and paint samples, to redevelop the couple’s new home, Frogmore Cottage, in time for the spring birth. She won’t be jumping on a plane to Mexico to make peace with her father in those circumstances. But with Thomas in ailing health, Harry needs to man up and fix what he inadvertently set off in the first place by failing to show Meghan’s father the necessary respect. Only then will Meghan and her father be reunited.Time is a great healer – but time is also something that we can never have enough of. Harry and Prince William spoke movingly last year of how they are haunted by their last hurried phone call to their mother, Princess Diana, the evening before she died.They were eager to get off the phone because they were having such a great time playing with their cousins at Balmoral. Harry said in an interview: ‘I can’t really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was.’It’s a sentiment we have all felt in one way or another. A visit we never made, a call not returned, and suddenly the chance to say what we wanted to say is gone for ever.Meghan is at heart a good and generous woman who is ambitious and could be critical in the reinvention of the Royal Family for another generation.But what she cannot be is forever cast as the cruelly unforgiving daughter of a heartbroken and lonely old man.And Harry holds the key to making sure that doesn’t happen – before it’s too late."},{"url":null,"title":"Man held attempt kidnap girl Christmas fair","story":"Witnesses have been urged to come forward (Joe GiddensPA)Body is found in search for British backpacker Grace...Share this articleOfficers were on the scene within minutes of the incident being reported. The suspect is described as white, around 5ft 9 tall and of a slight build. He is said to have been wearing a grey cap, a black jacket, jeans, trainers and glasses and was carrying a black rucksack.An investigation is under way, and police have called for anyone who witnessed the incident, or who has any other information, to come forward. People are asked to call on 101, quoting crime reference number PR45180130630 or contact independent charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."},{"url":null,"title":"Meet woman pays team FIVE 2 000 decorate three Christmas trees","story":"    Sonya Latham and her husband Paul spent £2,000 decorating the three trees in their household- one of which is a 11ft tree adorned with red and gold baubles that stands in the entrance hall\u0027People are always telling me I\u0027m obsessed with my Christmas tree,\u0027 says Laura, 33. \u0027I know I\u0027ve spent a lot of money on it, but I love it.

The UK homes transformed into winter...Share this articleFestive decorations are fast becoming the subject of the latest game of one-upmanship – as those with the money and an Instagram account outdo each other with the size, decorations and price of their Christmas spruce.Celebrities are rushing to be the first to unveil their efforts – usually professionally styled at an eye-watering cost.England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and his fiancee Megan Davison have shown off their tree, which was almost invisible underneath an avalanche of baubles, ribbons and stuffed toys, including polar bears and penguins. The none-too-subtle creation is believed to have cost almost £2,000.Comedian Paddy McGuinness posed with a tree five times his own height in the garden of his home, covered in gleaming gold lights.           In her living room stands a 9ft tree adorned with white and gold baubles. The retired couple, who have two children and three grandchildren, now have three stunning trees at their home near Market Harborough in LeicestershireAnd former Strictly contestant Katie Piper posted two photographs on Instagram last week. The first showed her show-stopping tree with twinkly Swarovski crystal decorations. The other was of a more modestly sized affair, decorated sweetly, albeit haphazardly, by her \u0027creative little girl\u0027.Katie finds herself in good company, as having multiple Christmas trees has become de rigueur in certain circles. The Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s mother Carole Middleton revealed she has several, including one for Prince George and Princess Charlotte to decorate themselves.John Lewis even offers a tree-styling service costing upwards of £450, in which staff hand-pick a tree and decorations, bring them to your home and dress it for you.           In a second reception room is another 9ft tree, this time decorated in gold, purple and ivyAnd those choosing to do the work themselves can still spend a fortune, with the store selling a 15ft unlit artificial tree for the princely sum of £999.Keri Sheehan is an interior stylist known as the \u0027Queen of Christmas\u0027 because she specialises in adorning Christmas trees for John Lewis and Peter Jones.\u0027People have become very competitive,\u0027 she says. \u0027Everyone wants theirs to look professionally decorated so it looks good on social media. Seeing other people\u0027s trees – particularly those of celebrities – has raised everyone\u0027s game.\u0027Having more than one tree is very popular now and people often have one they let their children decorate which they\u0027ll hide in a bedroom, while their big show tree will be beautifully styled and displayed in the hall or living room.\u0027For Laura, ensuring her tree looks as good as that owned by any celebrity is a cherished part of her Christmas preparations, which begin when most of us are still enjoying the final throes of summer. \u0027September is when the Christmas collection hits the John Lewis website, and I\u0027m on it straight away to see what the new themes are so I can buy more decorations,\u0027 says the mother- of-two from Stockport.Each decoration Laura owns has a special meaning to her or her daughters, Scarlett, eight, and Sienna, five.\u0027I spend more than £15 each on many of them, but I love them all because they have a story,\u0027 she says.           This week Laura Howell (pictured with daughters Scarlett 8 and Sienna 5) is turning the art of tree styling into something considerably more elaborate – and far more expensive\u0027Every year I buy the girls handmade ones from craft fairs with their names and the date on. They like pretty, girly designs so we have unicorns, mermaids and fairies, and baubles which are beaded or iridescent.\u0027I like glass and wooden ones, which is why they\u0027re expensive, and I\u0027m always buying more. I\u0027ve just found an astronaut one which I was excited about, because that\u0027s what I wanted to be as a child.\u0027According to Keri, Laura\u0027s passion for unique decorations is one of the year\u0027s biggest trends. \u0027I\u0027ve seen so many unusual designs – squids, cacti, unicorns,\u0027 she says.\u0027Personalisation is very popular, as are heirloom pieces, which cost a lot and are intended to be investments to keep for a long time.\u0027Among the most sought-after designs are those by Gisela Graham, whose delicately intricate fairy and ballerina ornaments cost up to £100. \u0027Decorations are becoming like items of jewellery to hang on the tree,\u0027 says Keri. \u0027I am seeing more and more bling.\u0027Laura\u0027s Christmas mania stems from her childhood, when her mother waited until two weeks before the big day to put up the family tree.\u0027I\u0027d be desperate to do it earlier and she\u0027d say, \u0027When you have your own house, you can do it as soon as you like.\u0027 Now she jokes, \u0027You really followed through on that, didn\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027She festoons the rest of her home with snow globes and Santa cushions. So extensive is her collection of decorations that it took Laura and her mother two hours to get them all out of the attic. \u0027The boxes filled the living room,\u0027 she laughs.\u0027I do it all while the girls are out and tell them elves decorated it. It makes me so happy to make everything look magical for them. \u0027And the tree is the most important part – it\u0027s my pride and joy.\u0027While putting up the tree has become a much-loved festive ritual for people like Laura, the ultimate Christmas indulgence has to be hiring somebody to decorate your tree for you, allowing you to sit back and watch while your home becomes a winter wonderland.For style specialists, business is booming. Anya Banks runs a premium Christmas decoration company and says that she\u0027s never been in greater demand.\u0027This year it\u0027s been absolutely crazy,\u0027 she says. \u0027It\u0027s been extremely busy, and I\u0027ve noticed it started earlier than usual, too.\u0027Among the homes Anya has already transformed is that of Sonya Latham and her husband Paul. The retired couple, who have two children and three grandchildren, now have three stunning trees at their home near Market Harborough in Leicestershire. In their entrance hall stands an 11ft beauty adorned with red and gold baubles, bows and golden twigs. The living room boasts a 9ft tree bedecked with gold, silver and white ornaments and cinnamon sticks. In a second reception room is another 9ft tree, this time decorated in gold, purple and ivy.\u0027It\u0027s an indulgence, but it\u0027s so lovely,\u0027 says Sonya, 61.\u0027The trees look so special and they\u0027re perfect – if I tried for a fortnight I could never make them look so nice.\u0027All the trees are artificial, but Sonya sprays them with pine scent to \u0027get the best of both worlds\u0027. She and Paul also own countless baubles, bows and lights.\u0027When we met Anya, she came to our house to talk about what we wanted and see the colour scheme of the rooms,\u0027 says Sonya. \u0027She sourced the baubles and garlands for us initially, and every year she replenishes anything that\u0027s looking a bit tired. She looks out for things I\u0027ll like, such as the gold pear ornaments she found this year.\u0027For £2,000, Anya and her team of five arrived at 9am on November 29 and spent more than six hours assembling and dressing the trees. They also decorated other parts of Sonya\u0027s home, including her orangery, in which they hung twigs and twinkly lights.On January 4, while the rest of us are lugging our threadbare firs to the local recycling point, Anya\u0027s team will reappear to take everything down again, leaving it all packed away neatly in boxes and her home looking spotless.For Sonya and Paul, the cost is worth it for the pleasure the immaculately decorated trees will bring them over the coming weeks.\u0027We love Christmas and the whole family are celebrating it at our house, so we want everything to look as inviting as possible,\u0027 says Sonya. \u0027It\u0027s Paul\u0027s birthday just before Christmas, so we\u0027ll be celebrating that, too – the decorations will be seen by plenty of people.

Obviously, with such a big tree it needed a lot to cover it.\u0027Steve\u0027s children are grown up, but they will be hosting friends and family for parties throughout the Christmas period, so they view the investment as worthwhile.Some will see this level of extravagance for a season which is over all too quickly as festive madness.But Jaclyn says: \u0027We love Christmas and it\u0027s great to have something everyone can enjoy when they come over.

As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take’.Although multiple sources say that a growing number of senior Government figures were urging Mrs May to delay the Commons vote until after another attempt to extract further concessions from Brussels, the Prime Minister was maintaining the line that her Cabinet was united behind the idea of holding the vote this week.‘I have obviously talked to my Cabinet colleagues as well as I talk to other colleagues. I think we all recognise that this is a good deal’, she insisted.Mrs May is privately furious that the Brexit ‘ultras’, including Jacob Ress-Mogg and Boris Johnson, are so determined to crash her deal that they will topple a line of dominos which could lead to a vote of no confidence, the end of Mrs May’s leadership, the suspension of Article 50, a General Election ushering in a Labour-SNP Government and a second referendum to attempt to reverse Brexit. As one ally says: ‘We would go to hell in a handcart’.But while large sections of her Parliamentary party remain unconvinced by her deal and her determination to put it to a vote, Mrs May says she has been cheered by more than 3,000 personal messages of support from ordinary voters.‘I’ve had a lot of letters, a lot of emails, a lot of support from people,’ she says. ‘It really has been encouraging. The overwhelming message from people is: let’s get this deal done and then we can focus on the future. People say, “look, we just wish you the best because we really want to see Brexit and we want to get on with this.”’Mrs May – one of the most effective stonewallers in Westminster –deflects all questions about whether she will resign if she is defeated over the deal or go back to Brussels to demand more concessions.But she is openly dismissive about moves by a cross-party group of MPs, led by Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, to call a second referendum – and withering about her predecessor Tony Blair’s call for one.‘His view is that we should go for another referendum,’ she said. ‘We had a people’s vote, that’s what frustrates me when people talk about this, the second referendum being a people’s vote. We had a people’s vote, let’s deliver on the first people’s vote.’The prospect of another General Election, particularly after last year’s fiasco, chills many Tory MPs, who argue that the party machine is not ready to fight a successful campaign, and that Mrs May is the wrong person to lead them into one.             \u0027Please do not remove from office\u0027 and \u0027Proud to be a Bloody Difficult Woman\u0027Mrs May was delighted when former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke called her a ‘bloody difficult woman’, and she celebrates the epithet on her mug. But will she last longer in her office than her hole punch?                         Her devotion to Philip, who she married 38 years ago after meeting at Oxford, is obvious. The tight bond between the pair was forged in extremis when her father, an Oxfordshire vicar, died in a car accident a year after the wedding. Her mother died the following year and she does not have any siblings.Mrs May praises Philip’s Christmas present choices, saying he is particularly ‘good at handbags he does pick a good handbag’.What is the best present she has got him? ‘I think he would look me in the eye and say, “You, darling!” ’Even Mrs May’s fiercest critics admire her resilience in the face of what must be almost intolerable pressure, combined with official duties such as last weekend’s 14,000-mile round-trip to the G20 summit in Argentina.It was former Chancellor Kenneth Clarke who delighted Mrs May by describing her as ‘a bloody difficult woman’.But surely her husband must worry about the impact of the pressure on the diabetic, 62-year-old Prime Minister. ‘He is like any supportive partner is,’ she says. ‘He’s there and wants to help.’She adds that she never takes out the strain on her staff. ‘I am not the sort of person who naturally loses their temper,’ she says, but confesses she does swear ‘sometimes’.Does she ever wake up with nightmares? ‘If I woke up and went “aaagh!” I’d probably have several armed police officers coming into the bedroom,’ she replies.The most unexpected moment of the interview comes when she reveals how she comforts herself after a gruelling day dealing with Jacob Rees-Mogg et al. ‘One of my little indulgences, I have to confess, is peanut butter. Either on toast, or just a spoon. But I don’t spend the entire day doing it.’Food has always been a passion for Mrs May: the woman who has more than 150 cookbooks says she is currently enjoying Ottolenghi Simple, by Yotam Ottolenghi, the Israeli-British chef.So although her workload means that she only sees ‘snatches’ of television programmes, she has enjoyed the ‘odd bit’ of the new Masterchef: The Professionals series: ‘They have been absolutely amazing, absolutely incredible.’But she hasn’t been to the cinema since watching Skyfall six years ago.Mrs May’s vicarage upbringing was imbued with the sense of public duty exemplified by her father’s work in the parish. ‘What my upbringing taught me was whatever you’re doing, put your whole self into it and do your best.‘I am genuinely trying to do my best for the country. I suppose it is a sense of public service’.Mrs May is keen not to strike a valedictory tone in the interview – but cites her work on modern slavery and establishing the National Crime Agency when Home Secretary as the greatest achievement of her political career.And she laments the fact that Europe has suffocated the domestic agenda, with passions such as boosting technical education and her industrial strategy drowned out by the noise of Brexit.But is she still the best person to lead the Conservative Party?‘Yes I am’.   "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abdf5b17296779b74c54785e8df4b7158a56c9b0/703_945_2840_1703/master/2840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1f38514bda824c8b23b8384b98b50e","title":"hannah starkey photographer interview space for women sean ohagan","story":"For more than 20 years the Belfast-born artist’s cleverly constructed portraits have captured the gestures of everyday female experience – and tried to find new ways of seeing women• See a gallery of Hannah Starkey’s photography‘When I first started out, photography was very male and not really considered art,” says Hannah Starkey. “I didn’t set out to have a feminist agenda, it was more that my interest in making work about women comes from the simple fact that I am one. That commonality of experience is at the heart of what I do as an artist.”Now 47, Starkey has been making images of ordinary women for more than 20 years, her complex, cleverly choreographed portraits blurring the lines between portraiture, documentary and staging. A new book, Photographs 1997-2017, is a selective survey of an artistic career that started in spectacular fashion when her MA show in 1998 caused quite a stir in the London art world and has since settled into a quiet, consistently attentive exploration of female experience that also implicitly questions how women are represented elsewhere in our profligate image culture.Though her photographs appear at first glance to be traditional observational documentary, they are deftly choreographed. Often she reimagines what she has observed on the street or in cafes, clubs and bars, using women she has hired to meticulously create stilled moments of female reverie, togetherness or fleeting interaction. The results are both truthful and artfully constructed, capturing the small gestures and glances of everyday experience while also subverting traditional notions of documentary and street photography.“In the beginning, I wanted to create a hybrid out of the different approaches I had been taught,” she says, “by somehow bringing together the emotive language of documentary with the slickness of advertising and the observational style of street photography. I think I’ve become more reflective and considered, but the performative element has been a constant.”Having “wandered into” photography via a vocational course at Napier University in Edinburgh, Belfast-born Starkey went on to study for an MA at the Royal College of Art. There she found her subject and her hybrid style, influenced, she says, by Peter Galassi’s book, Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort, which laid bare the anxieties at the heart of the American ideal of home through images by the likes of Nan Goldin, William Eggleston and Cindy Sherman. Her MA show featured seven large-format photographs of young women interacting, their style and compositional skill self-consciously referencing both classical painting and elaborate film stills. It caught the attention of London gallerist Maureen Paley, who left a note for her at the college and has represented her ever since.“That graduate show set me up,” says Starkey. “Suddenly I was in demand and simultaneously I became very aware of the different space that women occupy in the photography world, both as practitioners and subjects. I have been acutely aware of that ever since, the ways in which women are constantly evaluated and judged. My gaze is not directed in that way. A lot of what I do is about creating a different level of engagement with women, a different space for them without that judgment or scrutiny.”With two teenage daughters of her own, she is concerned about the tyranny of selfie culture and the ways in which young women are “being targeted much earlier as consumers and told constantly that their value is in their looks”. At the same time she is inspired by how younger female photographers are making their presence felt. “It just feels like things are opening up because so many young women are expressing themselves through photography.”Though Starkey has always been an implicitly political artist, the concluding series in the book – images of protesters at the Women’s March in London, 2017 – is the closest she has come to more overtly activist photography. Here, too, the images have been created using technological post-production, allowing her to distil the experience of the protest into more formally constructed photographs. She is, she acknowledges in the afterword to the book, “interested in the psychological truth more than the photographic truth.” That, perhaps, is the essence of her hybrid way of seeing.Photographs 1997–2017 by Hannah Starkey is out now (Mack, £40).

He said some reporting had come from “an ideological perspective” that Dawson “must be guilty”.“That is a worry because it can distort people’s memories and there have been significant delays in this case and inadequacies in the investigation by the police,” he said.But others argue that true crime podcasts have helped to add a layer of complexity and nuance to the genre of true crime reporting, and argue that media attention, no matter how intense, is nothing new for the legal system.“My gut reaction is that journalism has always been a curse for defendants,” Thalia Anthony, a University of Technology Sydney law professor told the  this week.“Trial by media is nothing new, in that sense, but I think the strength of some of the podcasts like Teacher’s Pet and Serial is they do something which tabloid newspapers haven’t done in the past by providing a layer of accountability and transparency in the process.“Think of the Sun in the UK running the headline ‘the truth’ after Hillsborough, in those examples you don’t get to, I guess, understand what biases are operating, whereas in a podcast you get a frankness of the journalist’s purpose but also a sense of their sources and the depth of the investigation.”Mother of two Lynette Dawson disappeared from her home on the northern beaches of Sydney in January 1982, when she was 33 years old.Chris, her husband, a former first grade rugby league player and PE teacher, has maintained ever since that he had nothing to do with her disappearance.But the mystery and circumstances surrounding the case have remained unanswered in the decades since, with no previous arrests despite two coronial inquests finding Dawson most likely killed his wife.And the podcast has heaped the full force of the Australian media’s glare on the case. Hedley Thomas – one of Australia’s most prominent journalists – has been at the centre of that. Peter Fray, a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald and now a journalism academic, said the collaboration between Thomas and the police was noteworthy.“I think it’s new use of the genre for two reasons. I mean first of all it brings up the question of trial by media, but I think what’s also interesting about Teacher’s Pet is the extent to which Hedley Thomas worked with the cops,” he said.“He’s obviously not the first journalist to work closely with cops, the exchange of ideas, contacts and information is sort of stock-in-trade for crime reporters, but I think the extent of the collaboration is somewhat new.”But does that hinder Chris Dawson’s right to a fair trial?Tyrone Kirchengast, a professor in criminal law at the University of Sydney, said any investigative crime reporting risked some form of prejudice to a defendant.“Really any kind of investigative reporting, particularly a podcast like this that turns out to be so popular, you’re talking about exposing a large number of people to something which could potentially influence or taint them as a juror,” he said.“It’s an example really of how good intentioned reporting looking at victim rights could effect rights of the accused.”But Kirchengast said that while podcasts might be a newer form of media, widespread exposure to a case was nothing new. He said criminal justice “shouldn’t try to compete” with technology.“Popularity itself doesn’t necessarily compromise a trial,” he said.“Could we still find 12 jurors who haven’t listened to the podcast? I think so.”Doug Humphreys, the president of the New South Wales Law Society, agreed. He said that despite the reach of Teacher’s Pet and other high-profile podcast series, the media’s interest in important cases is nothing new.“In any high-profile case there is always significant media attention and often courts go to extra lengths to warn juries to approach matters only on the basis of what is before the court,” he told the .“To date we’ve been largely successful in ensuring that’s the case. Obviously there have been some exceptions in the past, but all we can do is rely on the integrity of the system and the jury to only try matters based on what’s before them.”Thalia Anthony too said the criminal justice system’s role was to limit the role of prejudice, and said it was likely Dawson would face a judge alone trial.“There are protections in our criminal justice system to provide for a fair trial, the transfer of location, for example, though no where is immune when 28 million people have listened to it,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2222acadb02fa45ff56eef77da886ab9b8a5e336/313_248_4868_2921/master/4868.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4e6cb09e01e91d91dbd0853e32f4837","title":"with brexit the choices of the country have become clearer comment david gauke","story":"This Tuesday, the House of Commons votes on the deal agreed by the government with the European Union on the terms of our departure.For some of my colleagues, they are concerned that the deal is not sufficiently pure a Brexit to satisfy them. For others, the deal takes us too far away from EU membership.Like most MPs, I campaigned and voted to remain in the EU. I was concerned that extricating ourselves from a relationship built up over 40 years would be complex and challenging and that the economic cost of increasing friction in our trade with the EU would be high.I do not resile from that assessment. But these were arguments that were put before the British people and did not prevail. Leave won the vote. It wasn’t what I wanted but the government and parliament has a duty to implement that decision in the best way possible.Inevitably, the process has not been straightforward. There are tradeoffs between independence and co-operation, between regulatory autonomy and market access. This means that compromises are necessary to deliver a pragmatic Brexit that protects jobs and living standards while respecting the referendum result.The prime minister has succeeded in delivering that deal. The agreement delivers on the referendum result – we leave the institutions, the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, we will cease to make vast payments to the EU budget, freedom of movement comes to an end, as does the jurisdiction of the European court of justice. But we will still have a deep and special partnership that ensures continued co-operation on trade and security. It avoids the significant economic cost many feared would be the inevitable consequence of Brexit.In parliament, the arguments against the deal fall into three categories.First, there are those want no compromise with the EU and would be willing – even happy – to leave without a deal. I have to say that this would be an irresponsible act of self-harm.Second, there are those who accept that there is a need for a deal but just not this deal. Some argue for a Canada-style free trade agreement without a Northern Ireland backstop. Others, like the Labour frontbench, argue, in effect, for membership of the single market and customs union without free movement.Neither position is negotiable, as anyone with even a passing acquaintance of the thinking of the EU would know. A Canada-style deal for the whole of the UK results in a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. For that reason, it has never been acceptable to the EU without a permanent hard border down the Irish Sea.And it has been clear from the early stages of the negotiations that the type of relationship supported by the Labour frontbench means agreeing to free movement which Labour supposedly opposes.A slightly more credible position in terms of negotiability is to favour an EEA-plus customs union relationship. But given the level of continuity with the current relationship, including free movement, many will ask what is the point. Unlike the prime minister’s deal, we do not gain control of our laws, borders and money. We would neither be able to strike trade deals with countries around the world, nor would it be as straightforward to negotiate as some suggest.Others support the deal but for concerns about the backstop. The government is committed to not imposing a border in Ireland and the backstop guarantees that. It has been made abundantly clear that both sides would find this situation acutely uncomfortable. Nonetheless, what is clear is that no backstop means no deal.The third argument is to say that we should not proceed with Brexit until there has been a second referendum. But rejecting the deal to pursue a so-called “people’s vote” comes with great risks. It is by no means guaranteed to be a silver bullet. In fact, it is more likely to further entrench ision and lead to at least a further year of damaging uncertainty.The choices for the country have become clearer. No deal would cause unnecessary economic damage. No Brexit, which runs huge risks for our political stability. Or supporting a pragmatic deal that, yes, involves compromises but can ultimately bring the country together. Ruling out the only deal on the table puts the country in a perilous situation.So, let me make this appeal to those MPs of all parties who see themselves as pragmatists and who live in the world as it is, not as they would like it to be. Seize the opportunity to deliver a sensible Brexit and vote for the deal on Tuesday evening.• David Gauke is Conservative MP for South West Hertfordshire"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/085a99c5cbccf200dc29626e990af0a6ae62ea95/0_101_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd8ea24dcff90116584760f36da0818","title":"david lammy brexit is a betrayal","story":"The European Union was once just an audacious dream. A fragile hope built out of the ashes of two world wars. European integration was not just a project led by the French and the Germans from its birth, the UK had been an active parent. It was built on the values we sacrificed so much to protect: democracy, equality, human rights and freedom.Many of the Britain’s leaders in the 20th century – Clement Atlee, Harold Macmillan, Roy Jenkins, Harold Wilson – understood this first hand. And it was Winston Churchill who, in Zurich in 1946, first showed the courage and vision to articulate the case for integration. It is debated whether or not he saw Britain within this “kind of United States of Europe”, but months later, in May 1947, speaking in the Albert Hall, he argued: “Britain will have to play her full part as a member of the European family.”From its quixotic beginnings, European integration relied on the confidence of nations to be able to work together, pool sovereignty and take joint control. Britain at its best has always recognised that sovereignty is not an asset to be hoarded, but a resource that only has value when it is spent. It is why we have become the keenest treaty-signing power in the world, and why we have played an outsized role in the G7, G20 and global climate change negotiations.Edward Heath, the Conservative prime minister who brought us into what would become the EU, saw that Europe was post-imperial Britain’s opportunity to restore its wealth and dignity, and he did so with the memories of a soldier and student observer who had seen Europe tear itself apart. The generation who witnessed the Second World War first hand are no longer involved in British politics, but it would be a tragic error to forget the lessons of their experience.As soon as we became a member state, we began to shape Europe in our own image. Ironically, Britain’s imperial experience of constitution writing, part of diplomatic training, was useful for drafting EU legal texts. Witness Margaret Thatcher’s crucial role in the creation of the single market in 1986. There is a deep irony now that fears of immigration have pushed us to the exit door, given for decades it was Britain that pushed for more. As a nation we should be ashamed of the violent political rhetoric that has followed the arrival of hundreds of thousands of eastern Europeans from the mid-2000s. Their contribution has been vast. Over their lifetimes, European migrants in the UK will pay in £78,000 more to the exchequer than they take out. But the prime minister is not alone in turning away from our closest friends and most steadfast allies. Seventy years after 1945, we are drawing the wrong lessons from history. The lesson at Suez, of how the lethal combination of political isolation and imperial delusion led to a moment of excruciating humiliation, has been largely forgotten. Instead we focus on a distorted myth, in which a conflict of alliances, fought by Britain and the former empire is reduced to the “darkest hour” cliche, in which Britain supposedly “stood alone”.This misremembering of the past has enabled the Brexiters’ fetishisation of isolation and sovereignty. Rather than alliances and diplomacy, we are told all that is needed is that we “believe in Britain”. This is a fantasy that Churchill himself would have dismissed as childishly naive.In recognising Britain’s story of renewal through Europe, I do not forget that our country is crying out for change. A decade of austerity, of extremity and ision has left us as broken as after Suez, but leaving the EU will not help. After Theresa May’s deal is voted down, MPs from all parties have a responsibility to begin a new politics of hope. We need to build a new consensus around pride in our role shaping a peaceful and more prosperous Europe.One hundred years after the end of the First World War, we should celebrate Europe again. To do this we have to offer the public a chance to right the wrong of 2016 – another chance to vote for Britain at its best and another shot at the audacious, if imperfect, European dream.• David Lammy is Labour MP for Tottenham"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2dff9a0fa3b91d88c3b7b378e3902ce6621cd50/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df483156d40f6c6324b2cf7c55584285","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of happy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘happy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘happy’ (please note that these are no longer published online).Share your photos of what happy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 December at 10am.

The new lingerie is all about comfort and body confidenceAlso in 1994, AKA the Year of Our Cleavage, and in response to Wonderbra’s dramatic uplift in sales, rival lingerie brand Victoria’s Secret launched its first TV advert. VS has since become a global behemoth, best known for an annual catwalk show where its models, or “angels”, with spectacular bodies and pushed-up breasts – the highest paid of whom (models, not breasts) have included Adriana Lima, Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid and Joan Smalls – parade the catwalks in their next-to-nothings under the appreciative eyes of front-row guests, such as Leonardo DiCaprio, and a global TV audience of 500 million.The push-up bra as tool for (hetero-)sexual attraction has been the dominant trend in the women’s lingerie market for the past quarter of a century. But is its time up? Last month Victoria’s Secret came under fire for the lack of body-shape ersity in its most recent show (not helped by Ed Razek, its chief marketing officer, telling Vogue that he had no interest in transgender models or portraying a wider range of sizes and shapes), and there is evidence that the lingerie sector is ready to change into something more comfortable.“The definition of sexy has evolved,” is how Heather Gramston, buying manager at Selfridge’s Body Studio, the store’s lingerie, hosiery and sportswear department, puts it. “It is now defined as how a woman feels when she is wearing something – as opposed to what she looks like in archetypal lingerie created with men in mind. Women,” she adds, “are driving this.”One of Selfridge’s biggest brand launches this year is Myla. Originally founded in 2000, it was relaunched this year by former CEO of Agent Provocateur Gary Hogarth. Leila Habibi, Myla’s product and supply chain director and part of the original AP team, says of underwear in the 90s: “It was all about the push-up. Sometimes, my boobs were pushed up so far that by the end of the day they’d popped out.”Myla now uses the best French fabrics, but its styles and fits have moved with the times. Soft bras with triangle cuts and bralettes in stretch lace feature, as do sportier silhouettes and pyjama bottoms that you could wear out as much as stay in. Although they don’t like using the C-word (comfort) there’s more than a suggestion of it. “Women want to feel like they can move around, be active in their underwear, just like they are in their clothes. And we’ve got older,” says Habibi of the design team. She points out a bra with a higher, potentially more flattering cut under the arm. “Our bodies have changed and we wanted to reflect that in our cuts and shapes.”The British label Beija London goes so far as to claim it’s “definitely not selling sex.” Sister founders Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher have come up with an innovative range where each bra is created in three versions to suit various shapes. “The product is unsexualised, as are the model poses on the website, the hair, the make-up,” says Miranda. “It’s the opposite of Agent Provocateur. Some people are happy bossing their sexiness, but that’s not necessarily where you’d feel comfortable going with your daughter.”Digital engagement allows customers to interact directly with brands and them to respond accordingly. “What performs well for us on Instagram is if the model has a little bit of a roll on her tummy,” says Miranda. “It’s like seeing your hot friend. We’ll get an extra hundred likes for that more realistic image.”The body positivity message appears to be getting stronger even as the years move on. Back in 2016, the New Zealand label Lonely attracted attention when Girls’ creatorstar Lena Dunham and star Jemima Kirke fronted its campaign in unretouched images. Likewise, the minimalist underwear label Baserange prides itself on its no-retouching policy in its photography. Marie Yat Kan, founder of seamless underwearswimwear line Marieyat believes that lingerie is “all about feeling comfortable and confident in your own body and not about changing the appearance of your figure by pushing up or flattening assets”.Modern, minimal underwear with women in mindMinimalist: Rossell Launched in 2016, Rossell employs natural fabrics for cleverly designed underwear that supports without underwiring (rossellengland).Anti-shapewear: Marieyat Seamless, versatile, made from cotton and silk blends and wire-free, this brand blurs the line between lingerie and unisex underwear (marieyat).Modern classics: Myla Traditional French lace fabrics with a London-in-the-60s aesthetic.

We might as well eat it. Scourge of allotment holders, farmers and gardeners, the wretched birds can spot a cabbage seedling at 200ft. They had my crocuses last spring. Except that is more likely to be its distant and distinctly undelicious London cousin. I first came across Serve-You-Right Pie in Margaret Costa’s Four Seasons Cookery Book. Made with beef, bacon and the breast and leg meat of the pigeon, it has long been on my wish list. “Tiny bones are maddening in a pie,” says Mrs C quite rightly. Mixing so many animals under the same crust is not my bag so I would use the bird alone, its meat made to go further with leeks and mushrooms.The breasts are lean and therefore dry. The skin rarely crisps, especially if you have marinated the meat with olive oil, bay leaves and garlic. The answer to both conundrums is to cook the breasts briefly and off the bone, either on the bars of a griddle or in a shallow-sided pan with butter. I include crushed juniper berries for their aroma of gin-and-tonic, though I actually think they smell more like the original Eau Sauvage.The bones are pure treasure. Bring them to the boil with water, bay leaves, celery, onion and plenty of peppercorns, then lower the heat and let them simmer for half an hour to a clear and subtle broth. Bolster the pale liquor with slices of steamed pumpkin, sautéed mushrooms or, as the ultimate delicious revenge, some of your home-grown cabbage.There is a surprising quantity of meat on a plump pigeon breast. Cooked rare and sliced thin, you need just one bird per person if there are other good things on the plate. Greens, of course – soft folds of spinach or earthy chard, or sweet, butter-softened cabbage leaves, are contenders. A spoonful of sauce, deepened with meat juices, softened with cream and given a kick with a sharp fruit jelly is both traditional and rarely bettered.Remove the breasts from the birds, reserving the carcasses for broth. Cut the pears in half lengthways and then in half again removing the cores as you go. In a large frying pan, warm the butter and oil over a moderate heat then lay the pears in single layer and let them cook until light gold. Turn and lightly brown the other side, checking that the fruit is tender before setting aside. Keep the pears warm.Turn the heat up, place the pigeon breasts in the pan, adding a little more butter if necessary and fry until golden, turning once. Remove the pigeon to a small bowl and cover with a plate. Let them rest for 10 minutes. Reserve the pan with its cooking juices.Trim and wash the chard. Put the wet chard into a shallow pan over a moderate heat, cover with a lid and cook for 3 minutes until the leaves have wilted and darkened slightly. Drain and set aside.Crush the juniper berries using a pestle and mortar. Warm the pigeon juices over a moderate heat, then stir in the cream, let it bubble briefly then stir in the redcurrant jelly and crushed juniper.Put the rested pigeon breasts on a chopping board and slice each into two horizontally. Divide the chard between the plates, add the pigeon breasts and the pears, then spoon over the juniper sauce.Pigeon gives a clear, light, almost fatless broth. To add depth and body I include a handful of pork ribs with the spindly tangle of pigeon bones, turning them over until they are a rich golden brown, their meagre flesh sweet and caramelised. To this broth, sweetened with carrot and onion, you could introduce any crisp, lightly cooked vegetable or some soft textured mushrooms.In your largest saucepan, warm the olive oil over a high heat, add the pork ribs and brown them all over, turning them from time to time. Roughly chop the carrots and celery. Peel the onions and roughly chop them. When the ribs are nicely browned add the pigeon carcasses, let them toast for a minute or two then add the carrot, celery and onion, stirring them in the oil and meat juices to coat them. Pour in the water and add the bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring it to the boil, lower the heat and let it simmer for 1½ to 2 hours, until the pork and pigeon bones have done their work.Break the cauliflower into florets then slice each into pieces 1cm thick. Slice the mushrooms likewise. Melt the butter in a shallow pan then sauté the cauliflower for a minute on each side. As each piece starts to colour, remove from the pan. Add a little oil to the pan and fry the mushrooms.Strain the broth through a colander then correct the seasoning. You will need salt and perhaps a little more black pepper.Divide the mushrooms and cauliflower between four warm bowls. Mix a few dill fronds amongst the mushrooms then ladle in the hot broth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57365c09acd0ec026a60be1460caee100219144b/70_50_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=090a9bf3043c8fdd05fef8735e84b750","title":"arsenal huddersfield premier league match report","story":"Arsenal were able to inhale the sweet taste of a late victory thanks to the inspirational force of Lucas Torreira. The waspish presence who has breathed such effervescence into Arsenal’s midfield was the difference to break a tight, tense deadlock with an improvised overhead kick.Huddersfield’s unrelenting efforts meant Arsenal needed to extend themselves, to persevere, to keep plugging away to prise all three points out of this game. That kind of attitude seems to come naturally to Torreira.“We want to break every expectation with players and he is improving and works every day with good commitment and behaviour,” Unai Emery said. “He has the hunger we need. He can do very good work in defensive moments and he can get into the box and score.”The last time these teams met was an occasion that marked the curtain coming down on the Arsène Wenger era and Emery has proved himself a man unafraid to reshape the team as he did again here, and eager to recharge the energy levels. At the end of a demanding week his players found enough to scrap it out. In the seven minutes of stoppage time he was so engrossed as to wander all the way across into David Wagner’s technical area to beckon Sead Kolasinac over for a quick instruction.Huddersfield, like all of Arsenal’s Premier League opponents this season, got themselves safely to half-time. But a 0-0 scoreline did not reflect the nature of an increasingly feisty and complicated game, with tempers heating up and the yellow-card count veering out of control – five dished out over a five-minute spell set an intense tone. Huddersfield competed diligently, rising to the challenge set by Wagner to prove they could restrict Arsenal and give themselves a platform.There were chances, including a piledriver from Torreira that was parried brilliantly by Jonas Lössl and when Alexandre Lacazette found the net he was aghast to be penalised for a tight offside decision earlier in the move.Emery wasted no time in shaking it up. While his instinct was to push for the breakthrough, there were growing concerns at the back. Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Shkodran Mustafi picked up their fifth bookings of the season and will serve a suspension at a time when the squad are very short of fit and match-sharp centre-backs. Mustafi then hobbled off injured with what Emery described as a “small” hamstring injury.Laurent Koscielny’s appearance on the bench after a seven-month absence was timely but Arsenal have to use him cautiously after such a bad injury so Nacho Monreal came on instead. The defensive trio for the closing stages comprised Granit Xhaka flanked by Monreal (nominally a left-back) and Papastathopoulos. Remarkably, they held it together for a first clean sheet in the Premier League since September.Huddersfield contributed wholeheartedly, even if they missed some cutting edge. Alex Pritchard scooped one effort over and later on appealed in vain for a penalty. Arsenal’s increasing desperation showed as Mattéo Guendouzi was booked for ing (a third for simulation in the game). The teenager was more productive in the 83rd minute, prising Huddersfield open with a well-crafted ball for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. The Gabonese found room to chip over a cross and Torreira was there to deliver another big moment for his new club.Wagner felt his team deserved something. “Because of defensive shift and effort and tactical quality we limited Arsenal and kept them away from our goal. That’s enough if you are Huddersfield Town to deserve a point,” he said. “Unfortunately we don’t have it. I can see the positives.”Now 21 games unbeaten for Arsenal, on they go. “The injuries and yellow cards are coming with matches,” Emery said. He will need to keep shuffling to find solutions. Having bustled around all game long, he is looking forward to a couple of days off to clear his busy head."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7347f7914da767c62d77d6022dde62b7fd9bb2e0/108_577_4810_2886/master/4810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2118b04acc252ee2a5439b6c1a35107b","title":"chelsea manchester city premier league match report","story":"Now, perhaps, we can understand why Pep Guardiola did not want to entertain any questions before this match about the possibility of Manchester City going unbeaten through the entire season. The Invincibles mark II? Not quite. The champions have been reminded what it feels like to lose a Premier League match, eight months since it last happened, and suddenly it is Guardiola’s team playing catch-up at the top of the table.Those of us who have lauded them for so long would probably be well advised not to join the stampede of revisionists finding fault in what had previously looked like a perfectly oiled machine. Yet, if nothing else, at least it is a reminder that City are not as slick as many people believed. They had been behind for a grand total of 12 minutes in all their previous league fixtures and, on the evidence of this defeat, it is fair to say Liverpool, the new leaders, can be encouraged by the possibilities that have opened up.One bad result does not change the fact City are a supreme, brilliantly efficient and dangerous football team – quite possibly the most exciting collection of players we have seen in English football. But it was also brought into sharp focus during this display that Guardiola and his players have not, contrary to popular opinion, created a form of football perfection. Not yet, anyway.For starters, there is no point outpassing opponents if you don’t outscore them, as was the case with City before N’Golo Kanté’s goal completely changed the course of this match. For the opening 44 minutes, Chelsea were grateful for City’s inability to turn their superiority into the hard currency of goals. Thereafter, Maurizio Sarri’s team played as though determined not to let an away side dictate play so comprehensively. Their victory was sealed by David Luiz’s 78th-minute header from a badly defended corner but, even taking into account the home side’s improvement, it must have been startling for Guardiola to see the deterioration in his own players. Their response to going a goal down was surprisingly weak and, at 2-0, there was absolutely nothing from the visitors to make it look as though they still believed the game was salvageable.Instead, it turned out to be the most satisfying result yet for Chelsea of the Sarri era, while Guardiola will have to accept it did not work to start the match with Raheem Sterling operating through the middle. City undoubtedly missed the injured Sergio Agüero during the parts of the game early on when they were let down by a lack of penalty-area ruthlessness. David Silva went off with a possible hamstring strain and, perhaps for the first time, City badly needed Kevin De Bruyne, the match-winner in this fixture last season.Tactically, Sarri did something similar to Guardiola with Chelsea’s frontline, with Eden Hazard playing through the middle and Álvaro Morata not even among their substitutes. Early on, however, it was not easy to gauge the success of this experiment, simply because the home team found it difficult to create any momentum whatsoever. Hazard could be seen turning to Sarri, arms outstretched, as if to say he was not particularly relishing his central role. The game had not reached the half-hour mark and, at that stage, not many people could have imagined Guardiola would be walking on to the pitch at full-time to congratulate the victorious players in the darker shade of blue.Chelsea rode their luck at times but this was also a reminder that football is ultimately about putting the ball in the net rather than merely looking elegant in possession. Leroy Sané alone had three chances to open the scoring and Sterling could not get a clean contact with probably the most inviting opportunity of the opening 45 minutes. Chelsea, on the other hand, were clinical, taking the lead on the only occasion they caught their opponents out of position in the first half. Hazard slipped the decisive pass between two defenders and Kanté’s shot, from close to the penalty spot, was still rising at it flew into the roof of the net.Until that point, the pattern of the game was a familiar one for regular City-watchers, with the away team knocking the ball around with immense confidence and streaming forward in what was, at times, a 4-1-5 formation. Ederson refrained from making any no-look passes or keepie-ups inside his own six-yard area, as he had in the midweek win at Watford, but neither was the Brazilian particularly troubled before Chelsea surprised everybody, perhaps even themselves, by taking the lead.Chelsea began the second half as though determined that it would not follow the same pattern as the opening 45 minutes and, having starting the match with Sterling as a false 9, Guardiola soon brought on a real one in the form of Gabriel Jesus, albeit wearing the No 33 shirt. Sané, who had lost Kane for the opening goal, was taken off, with Sterling switching to the left, and Riyad Mahrez often looking like City’s best hope on the opposite side.By the time the game reached the hour-mark, however, City had stopped passing the ball as effectively and Bernardo Silva, in particular, had gone off the boil. Chelsea had lost Mateo Kovacic with a second-half injury but were now looking far more controlled. Kanté’s influence was growing, while César Azpilicueta’s defending typified their determination not to surrender the lead. Something strange and unexpected was taking shape: a football match in which Guardiola’s men suddenly looked devoid of ideas.Guardiola was aggrieved about the corner decision that led to David Luiz’s goal but the replays confirmed the ball had gone out via a faint touch off Mahrez’s foot. City’s manager ought to have been more concerned about the marking from Hazard’s corner, or the chaos that was caused by David Luiz’s long, diagonal pass in the moments before Kanté’s goal. It turns out City are fallible, after all, and the most relevant question now, perhaps, is how quickly they can shake it out of their system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab15d4bc07fdefd66f2d4db20c4c1ef3aa9c63d9/0_42_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a85617bbf6d78483ab398c2171d59b1","title":"leicester city tottenham premier league match report","story":"How deceptive appearances can be. On the face of things this was hardly an assignment Mauricio Pochettino would have asked for with a potentially season-defining match in Barcelona three days away, and to the naked eye his decision to name Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen on the bench seemed to play fast and loose with the evening’s outcome. Yet reality told a different tale: one of a surprisingly comfortable win that at once minimised Tottenham’s stress levels before visiting the Camp Nou and left them aglow with what feels like a renewed set of possibilities on the domestic front.That they departed so buoyantly owed plenty to Son Heung-min, whose slow start to the season has seemed a distant memory over the past three weeks. A largely dreary first half was drawing to a close when, cutting inside on to his left foot, he cracked a marvellously clean 20-yard shot across Kasper Schmeichel and ended a Leicester resistance that had just begun to appear precarious. He crossed for Dele Alli to score Spurs’ second after half-time and ensure that, with 36 points from 16 games, they have made their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign.“Now I will allow us to start thinking about Barcelona,” Pochettino said, although Tuesday’s fixture had manifestly crossed his mind well in advance. As Leicester asked questions of Tottenham’s defence in the first 20 minutes, while a mobile but outwardly brittle front three of Son, Alli and Lucas Moura struggled to impose themselves further forward, an inquest into his resource management did not seem unrealistic. But they settled thereafter, keeping possession well enough to deprive the home side of counterattacking oxygen and gradually making inroads in attack. The end product left Pochettino, whose side have responded admirably to their defeat at Arsenal and its surrounding storm, visibly enthused and sufficiently confident to talk up their chances of staying in the title race.“The reality is that we are there fighting,” he said, having seen Manchester City’s defeat at Stamford Bridge offer a shaft of light to those chasing the top two. “We are in a very good position with Liverpool, City, Chelsea and Arsenal. That is the reality.” They have not drawn any of their last 20 league games the defeats, when they come, tend to bring doubts about their ability to match those around them but Spurs showed again here that the winning habit is hard to kick.They limited Leicester’s chances to an early flurry and then, when the game had long since been wrapped up, a succession of crosses flashed across goal. Jamie Vardy was missing for the second week in a row, a groin injury continuing to lay him low, and Kelechi Iheanacho was a nervy stand-in. He shot wildly over when sent away by an early ball over the top although Jan Vertonghen then denied him a tap-in after the overlapping Ben Chilwell had crossed. There were cheers from some sections of the crowd when he was replaced by Rachid Ghezzal early in the second half and Leicester, who have as good a chance as anyone of landing the “best-of-the-rest” spot below the top six, look in need of more potent attacking options in January.As it happened Ghezzal’s chances of effecting an improvement were nixed almost instantly. Two minutes after he came on, Tottenham’s forwards contrived a tour de force, Moura finding Son on the left and Alli, with characteristically adept timing, running in from the opposite side to head the South Korean’s cross in at the far post. He was arguably a shade offside, but not obviously enough to impact upon the post-match narrative.Now they travel to Catalonia with that vigour spread across the entire team. Kane, whose vigorous applause of Son’s goal from the bench was perhaps laced with relief that he would not be wheeled out for a salvage operation here, received a light runout for the last 20 minutes and Eriksen was afforded only slightly more. The cotton-wool exercise paid off and the only possible dampener for Spurs was an injury to Serge Aurier, who hobbled off to be replaced by Kyle Walker-Peters. It was hardly the biggest of troubles and the benefit of such a stately evening’s work may become apparent soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07df1b1766af39152a0c16ae941e3737ff60fc13/0_55_2724_1634/master/2724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a34cb9fe44487c8b740a360f134e1c0e","title":"manchester united fulham premier league match report","story":"If only Manchester United could play Fulham every week people might begin to take them more seriously. The joke before kick-off at Old Trafford was that Liverpool had done United a favour by winning so handsomely at Bournemouth, because goal difference might be important in the battle for eighth place.Enter the Premier League’s bottom club, with a performance to prove the table does not lie, and suddenly United are not just above Bournemouth but up to sixth. Admittedly Everton do not play until Monday but José Mourinho will take what he can at the moment.“We are unbeaten in four league games,” the allegedly happy one said beforehand, which was one way of putting positive spin on the fact United had not picked up a win since before Bonfire Night. “We were good at every level in the first half,” the manager said. “We played like I want us to play, we were a compact unit that gave Fulham no chances.”Fulham were kind enough to let United boost their goal difference with their biggest win of the season, and although a significant gap remains to the top five, Mourinho and his players are at least in the right place to be pushing for a Champions League spot.On the edge of the European positions sounds a lot better than mid-table obscurity, though a truer test will come at Anfield next Sunday. Claudio Ranieri’s strugglers were far too easily dominated, with the Italian reduced from an early stage to standing on the touchline with a resigned look and extended right hand to show his players the direction they were supposed to be playing. With just Aleksandar Mitrovic ploughing a lonely furrow up front it never happened, and Fulham looked beaten from the moment Ashley Young opened the scoring.The United captain initially appeared likely to attempt a cross when he took the ball high on the left but once he beat Denis Odoi to find space in the area he caught sight of goal and found Sergio Rico’s top corner with a curling right-foot drive.Juan Mata scored next, applying a confident finish after Marcus Rashford cut back the ball from the goalline. Romelu Lukaku was criticised earlier in the week for not doing much except trying to score goals, so he should be quite proud of the pass that played Rashford behind the Fulham defence. Rashford then had the awareness to pick out Mata at the back of the penalty area, and when his shot beat Rico’s e the contest was as good as over.The Fulham fans certainly seemed to think so. “You’re nothing special, we lose every week,” was the chant from the travelling support.Rico produced a good stop to keep out a thunderous free-kick from Rashford, before United increased their lead just before the interval with a slick triangular passing move that clearly pleased Mourinho. Jesse Lingard found Mata, whose first-time ball along the six-yard line was neatly tucked away by Lukaku.Fulham showed a little more life after Ranieri made two half-time substitutions, though their best chance in open play fell to André Schürrle following a weak clearance by Diogo Dalot, and the winger skied his shot. It summed up Fulham’s afternoon when less than two minutes after Aboubakar Kamara had pulled a goal back from the penalty spot, following a foul on the substitute by Ander Herrera, they went down to 10 men when a studs-up challenge on Rashford by André-Frank Zambo Anguissa brought a second yellow.Any hopes of United running up a cricket score were dashed when Rico managed saves from Rashford and then Lukaku, although the goalkeeper was beaten at his near post when Rashford scored an audacious fourth from the angle of the area.Had Fred not tried a risky pass rather than a straightforward one in stoppage time United might have hit five in the league for the first time since Sir Alex Ferguson stepped down.In the end Fulham were not quite that obliging but it was close. “It is quite simple,” Ranieri said with his usual pithiness. “If we play like we did in the first half, we will be relegated. Play like we did in the second and we can survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a17b00e0037016bddbca326d3b807bc90987a4/0_176_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=388d9a824aca477fabd6562e1d6166b7","title":"qaser al yahud mission to restore faith halo trust west bank landmines restoration churches","story":"In the West Bank, at the third most holy site in Christianity, work is under way to clear thousands of landmines and reopen seven ancient churches abandoned since 1967’s six-day warBravery comes in many guises, but in those whose work demands courage on a near-daily basis, it often takes the form of a certain studied nonchalance. Lasha Bluashvili, who makes his living clearing landmines, is a case in point. He would rather go to the trouble of making me a cup of tea – here in the Judean desert, the kettle stands on a gas canister inside an old oil drum – than talk of what I regard as his everyday heroism.“Oh, don’t worry,” he says, fingers lightly tapping a cigarette packet. “We never forget the dangers. But everyone here knows their job. We are all very well trained.”Is this project important to him?“I don’t think about that.”Well, is it satisfying?“Let’s speak of this when we’re finished.”I push him. Can he imagine that day? How will he feel then? For a few moments, he looks impassively around the tented area in which we’re sitting – at the jars of instant coffee, and the plastic tubs of hummus – until, finally, something inside him gives way.“Of course I’ll be happy,” he says, turning to face me again. He smiles. “We will have made history.”Bluashvili, a bear of a man who wears his preternatural calmness like a suit of armour, is the leader of a 16-strong team of de-miners that since last March has been working on a site close to a section of the west bank of the River Jordan that tradition holds to be the spot where Jesus Christ was baptised by John the Baptist. The third most holy site in Christianity (after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem and the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem) this place, known in Arabic as Qasr al-Yahud, was for hundreds of years one of pilgrimage – there are records of monasteries on the site dating from 400AD – and in the 1930s, seven churches were built here, each of them on a plot of 10,000 square metres (the land was parcelled up and sold to them by the British, during the period of its Mandate in Palestine). One, a Franciscan chapel, belongs to the Roman Catholic church the others belong to six Orthodox churches: Coptic, Ethiopian, Greek, Romanian, Russian and Syriac (the Armenian Apostolic Church was also sold a plot by the British, but for some reason never built on it).In these compounds – most also contain small dwelling places – lived the priests and monks who conducted services here, performed baptisms in the nearby river, and celebrated Epiphany, a feast day that in the Orthodox Church traditionally involves water rites.But then, in June 1967, came the six-day war, in which Israel was attacked by three of its Arab neighbours, Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Afterwards, a victorious Israel, having seized the West Bank from Jordan, turned the western side of the valley into a restricted military area and bordered it with 2,600 anti-tank mines. The churches, abandoned by order of the Israeli government, were reportedly booby-trapped, surrounded with antipersonnel mines, and left to fall into ruin. In the decades that followed, no one was able to worship in them though this land lies within the West Bank, it remains an Israeli military zone, classified as Area C under the Oslo Accords.Today, pilgrims have once again begun to flock here, but the gleaming tour buses that deliver them to the River Jordan sweep swiftly past these crumbling, spectral churches, along a narrow strip of land that was de-mined by the Israeli army in 2000, ahead of the visit of Pope John Paul II to the baptismal site (this strip, at the urging of the Pope, was opened to the public, albeit during tightly controlled hours, in 2011).It is an extraordinary situation: one that could perhaps only happen here, in a country where so many things are so extreme. Is there anywhere else in the world where such numbers of tourists – annually, around 650,000 make the journey – find themselves in such close proximity to thousands of landmines? What on earth do these visitors think when they see the signs warning them of the dangers behind the chainlink fence that separates the minefield from the asphalt expanse of the car park, from the squat little building where they buy their postcards and wooden crosses and bottles of holy water?I have wanted to write about Qasr al-Yahud since 2016, when I first heard of the plan to clear its minefield. The project to make safe this area is complex, and for many reasons. While mine clearance is always dangerous, laborious and expensive (it costs $10 to lay a mine, and $2,000 to lift one), here there are many additional problems: military maps that have proved to be inaccurate mines that have been degraded by the desert conditions and are now highly unstable the fact that in summertime, temperatures can reach 45C. And then there is the political situation. The chapels are owned by the various churches, institutions that are often rivalrous with one another, and which are also currently burdened in financial terms with supporting their imperilled communities in Syria and Iraq. Meanwhile, the area itself – a Holy Site, governed by Israel’s Protection of Holy Places Law – is Palestinian territory, but managed by the (Israeli) Nature and Parks Authority on behalf of Cogat (Co-ordination of Government Activities in the Territories). To translate, even in a place where almost all land is contested, this hallowed ground has a number of competing claims on it.In the days before I visit, the news from Israel isn’t good. There is trouble in Gaza following a botched Israeli covert operation in the territory that kills seven alleged Palestinian militants and one Israeli soldier in retaliation, Gazan militants fire missiles into Israel. It seems so unlikely – nothing short of a miracle, in fact – that a project such as this one, which involves both sides of the conflict, could ever have got off the ground. But it has, and for this the credit must go to the Halo Trust, the world’s largest humanitarian mine clearance organisation (and the NGO that famously arranged for Princess Diana to walk through a minefield in Angola in 1997).It was Halo that secured the support of the churches (they and their congregations are a source of funding), and it is Halo that has enabled the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli government to work together effectively at Qasr al-Yahud by acting as a neutral buffer between them. (This neutrality explains why, while some medical and engineering staff on the site are Palestinian, the mine clearers are neither Palestinian nor Israeli but Georgians, like Lasha Bluashvili, men who were originally trained by Halo to clear mines in their own country following the conflict with Russia in 2008.)The Israeli National Mine Action Authority (INMAA) and the Palestinian Mine Action Centre (PMAC) might not talk directly to each other, but so far the Israeli government has contributed $535,000 in total to the project, while PMAC seems to be doing everything it can to make plain its support for the plan, albeit without ever quite acknowledging the Israelis’ contribution. “The Halo Trust is an honest broker,” said a smiling Osama Abu Hananah, the Palestinian general who runs PMAC, when I met him in Ramallah. (He also insisted we pose for photographs.)Why, though, should anyone other than the churches regard this project as a priority? No one lives in this desolate spot ostensibly, it has no obvious humanitarian benefits. The West Bank, where Halo has been clearing mines since 2014, is riddled with minefields, many of which are located inside villages shouldn’t they come first? In his office at the Ministry of the Interior, General Hananah showed me photographs of the devastating injuries caused to Palestinians by landmines one boy’s second degree burns at first made him so ashamed he spent his days hiding under his bed. A PMAC database estimates that there have been at least 1,000 casualties since 1967. Nowhere else in the world, Hananah insists, are landmines situated in such close proximity to civilians’ homes as they are in crowded Palestine.Halo’s line is that it is promoting “interfaith dialogue”. But the project is also a newsworthy means of conveying its work to the world, which so often ignores the issue of minefields. Israel has not signed up to the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty, so from its point of view, perhaps this project makes for some good international PR. It seems likely, too, that the Israelis feel competitive with Jordan, which has successfully developed the east side of the river bank (cleared of mines in 2012, it was subsequently declared a Unesco World Heritage Site). The Palestinians, meanwhile, know that there will be financial benefits for nearby Jericho, and for East Jerusalem, if tourist numbers rise once the churches reopen. Above all, both sides seem to regard it as a sign of hope, a symbol of all that can be done when people find a way to work together – and perhaps this is why the project feels to me so remarkable, one of the most quietly significant stories I’ve ever worked on. I lived in Israel as a child I’ve worked here regularly as an adult. I deeply love both it and the West Bank. But there is also no ignoring the fact that each time I arrive, the situation always feels a little worse, a little more intractable. At Qasr al-Yahud, though, I can’t help but feel just the smallest bit optimistic. Here is a chink of light. “What a wonderful thing this is,” says Moshe Hilman, a passing official from INMAA on the day of my visit. He opens his arms, as if he would embrace the place. His smile is almost as big as the desert sky.But there’s something else at play here, too, and it has to do with faith – or, if you prefer, with myth. People in this part of the world tend to believe, and this takes its effect. Even to a non-believer, such an atmosphere can be both infectious and moving. “I am a religious person,” says Anwar Ermiliah, the young Palestinian (and Muslim) doctor whose job it will be to treat the wounded should there be an accident on the site. “So I’m very happy people will be able to pray here again.” Dispassionate and jokey as they are (they shrug like teenagers at the merest hint of praise), the phlegmatic Lasha Bluashvili and his team are all Orthodox, attending the Georgian church in Jerusalem every Sunday they know their Bible, and though this makes no difference to the day-to-day nature of their work, it gilds it somehow – which is why he speaks of making history. This isn’t just any desert. These aren’t just any piles of rubble. What a story this is: something to tell their children, and their children’s children.I arrive at Qasr al-Yahud one late November morning shortly after 7am, having driven from Jerusalem with Ronen Shimoni, Halo’s programme manager in the West Bank. Bluashvili and his team are already here eager to get started before the sun grows too warm, they usually have to wait for the Israeli army to open the gate – but things are still peaceful. The tourist coaches are yet to appear (from 8am, they will begin arriving in their dozens – which is slightly surreal given that, from a distance of less than a kilometre, I will then be contemplating the twisted remains of an Israeli army vehicle that reversed into a land mine earlier this year). But for now we have the place to ourselves. Except, of course, that we don’t, or not in the sense that we can just stroll around. At this point, some seven months from the date Halo expects the site to be fully cleared, the greater part of these 100 hectares is still strictly off-limits.The first thing we do is climb to the top of a dune close to the tent that serves as the mine clearers’ rest area (they work for 40 minutes at a time, after which they must then rest for 20). Fifty years ago, this was an Israeli gun position: a concrete bunker marks the place where the soldiers would have crouched, gazing across at the enemy in Jordan. It’s a good vantage point. Shimoni explains which church is which, and then he points out the clearly visible lines of the anti-tank mines that surround the site, as neat as the animal footprints – probably a gazelle’s – I can also see. From here, you get not only a sense of the scale of the work Halo is doing, but also of something more ghostly. At what point exactly were these holy places abandoned, and how fast did this have to happen? No one seems to know the answer to these questions. But it must have been swift. Shimoni takes out his phone. Two of the churches are now clear of land mines: the Franciscan, and the Ethiopian. “This is what we found inside the Franciscan church,” he says, showing me a photograph. The image is of a cupboard, stacked with perfectly preserved china tea cups, plates and tins of food.Shimoni and his colleague Tim Porter, who is visiting from Halo’s head office in Scotland, explain the various methods involved in 21st-century mine clearance. Nowadays, the technology available includes a sophisticated magnetometer that measures distortions in the earth’s magnetic field caused by the presence of buried metal, and then generates a map of their location. Sometimes, though, there is no substitute for the human hand. On occasion, the de-miners use a technique known as the “bucket rake” to inspect contaminated soil that may contain smaller, harder-to-detect (but still dangerous) mine remnants and other bits of unexploded ordnance, and as we look down on the road that runs through the site, it is this method they’re currently deploying now work has begun. It is heart-stopping to see. An area of land having been mechanically excavated to a minimum depth of 35cm, the soil is then spread along the road by an armoured front loader. The de-miners, wearing their blue kevlar aprons and polycarbonate visors, stand at intervals alongside it. Each one has in his hand a rake, with which he then picks through it. Is this dangerous? “Well, the rakes have quite long handles,” says Shimoni. I think that means yes.The team of 16 is split in two. All are trained in basic medicine, so that, should something go wrong, those who are resting rather than working are on hand to provide support. Meanwhile, Dr Ermiliah and an ambulance driver (both are on site full time) will be radioed they, in turn, will radio an Israeli army ambulance in Jericho, which will take the casualty to hospital in Jerusalem. When we come down from the dune, Shimoni shows me where the medical supplies, and a fire extinguisher, are kept. Nearby is a pile of mortar cases, gathered from the site over the months. Should the men’s tendency to josh, and their moans about the strictness of Israeli health and safety regulations, distract me, even briefly, from the seriousness of their purpose, here is the corrective – these things, and the way Dr Ermilah casually drops the word “amputation” into our conversation.After this, we visit the two safe churches. The Franciscan church is small and plain (to walk to it I, too, must wear personal protection the site is clear, but has not yet been signed off as being so). The monks’ former accommodation is on the ground floor, and the chapel on the roof and open to the air (Epiphany, which in this part of the world marks the baptism of Christ rather than the adoration of the Magi, is traditionally celebrated outside). The building is pockmarked with bullet holes, and for a time I stand at its altar, staring across at Jordan, where its own collection of chapels stands intact and immaculate. I see the line of vegetation that marks the now desperately depleted river, and beyond it the domes of what must be a Russian orthodox church, golden in the sunlight.But it is the Ethiopian Church that captures my imagination. Apart from the de-miners who spent five months making this compound safe, the Archbishop of the Ethiopian Church in Jerusalem and one of his priests, I am the first person to stand inside this building since it was abandoned in 1967. For all its dereliction, it is hauntingly beautiful. Here is the tomb of some long dead Ethiopian bishop there, high on a chancel wall, is a painting of the Ascension. The remnants of life that are all about are so poignant. Upstairs, in a room that must once have been occupied by a monk is a flimsy pamphlet entitled Agriculture in Ethiopia – a reminder that the inhabitants of this dry and dusty place had somehow to cultivate their own crops. When I wander on to the church’s roof, I notice that the lightbulbs that would once have made its iron cross visible from miles away are, miraculously, nearly all unbroken. It’s dizzying, the way the years seem suddenly to concertina, past and present colliding in a manner that is both uncommon and uncommonly powerful.Before my visit to Qasr al-Yahud, I make house calls on some of those with a stake in what’s happening there. A friend I email from my hotel says that these encounters sound like something out of Robert Byron (the Englishman who made his name writing about the Middle East in the 1930s), and it’s true: for 48 hours, I feel like some slightly confused time-traveller, one who must strive to get her head round her interviewees’ capacity for embellishment and a certain kind of myth-making even as she shows her respect for their traditions, rituals and customs. Not that this isn’t exciting. As I wait for my audience with His Beatitude Theophilos III, the Greek Patriarch of Jerusalem – a retainer brings me a tiny glass of cognac and a large bowl of sweets – I have a rising sense of elation: so many doors are swinging open for me. But I feel more and more that I’m sitting on top of a giant onion. What layers are here, and how tricky it can be to peel them.Those I meet are keen to tell me of their own church’s long history in the Holy Land in general, and at the baptismal site in particular. It’s a kind of competition. Father Sergey Loktionov, a Franciscan monk at St Saviour’s Monastery in Jerusalem, begins by telling me that Franciscan pilgrims certainly visited the site in the 15th century, and probably before that. He then shows me a series of photographs of the Franciscans at Qasr al-Yahud that date back to the late 19th century – in one, the fathers are performing a baptism in the river from a tiny wooden boat – as well as the chapel’s last visitor book. “Look,” he says, turning its pristine pages, “the final entry is from January 1967: pilgrims from Nigeria.” What does the clearance of the site mean to him? “It means life,” he says. At the Ethiopian Monastery not many minutes’ walk away, I meet Aba Zebeaman Samuel, the Wani Megabi of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church (the Archbishop is in Ethiopia Megabi is translated for me as “manager”). He wears a navy cassock, and a huge diamante cross. In Jerusalem the Ethiopians are famously marginalised: at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the site where Christ was crucified and was buried, its monks were long ago forced out, and now inhabit the roof (control of the church is shared among six denominations). But this seems hardly to matter to Samuel. Those who “push and push” the Ethiopians are just so many johnny-come-latelys. “The history of the Ethiopian church is like an ocean, it’s so big,” he says, with a smile. “We are the oldest church here.” The Queen of Sheba, he insists, was an Ethiopian this marked the beginning of the presence of Ethiopians in this land. Later, after the Ascension of Christ, the Queen of Ethiopia sent a messenger to meet St Philip. What about the baptismal site? “For a long time, our monks lived there without any shelter, under the trees. Then the wife of Haile Selassie saw their suffering. She bought the plot, and paid for the church. We’re so happy to get it back.”Told to the smell of incense and the distant sound of bells ringing, these are beguiling stories, even given the difficulties of translation (Father Sergey, who is Russian, speaks Italian to a Palestinian colleague who then puts everything into English). But they only say so much. It’s left to Jerusalem’s most powerful and wily churchman, Theophilos III, to weigh for me the churches’ power in Israel – and thus to reveal why he in particular has been so encouraging to Halo. This he does in a long receiving room at the Greek Patriarchate, a secluded realm of marble and gold, where he awaits me on a throne-like chair inlaid with mother-of-pearl. In Jerusalem, meeting the Greek Patriarch is not unlike meeting the Pope (around 80,000 Israeli Arabs and Palestinians are Greek Orthodox, a figure that hardly bears testament to the Patriarch’s singular power, especially in Jerusalem). Thrillingly, I have him to myself for 40 minutes: a clear sign of how important the work at Qasr al-Yahud is.The Patriarch regards what is happening there as a symbol of reconciliation. But he also makes it clear that he believes that once the chapels are in use again, the church will be better able to play a part, if necessary, in keeping this land from appropriation by “radical groups” – by which, even if he doesn’t use the word, he means settlers. After all, this is what it has done elsewhere. “In Jerusalem, our inheritance is a spiritual one,” he says (his English, like his Arabic, is fluent). “We are the mother church. Our first bishop was St James, the brother of Christ. But we have a physical inheritance, too, in the form of the buildings we own: our basilicas, monasteries, and houses. Inside the walls of the Old City, and outside it, too, there are 30 monasteries that belong to us, and their location is of paramount significance from a strategic point of view. They guard and maintain the current religious demography in the city. We are a buffer zone between the various entities, between the Israelis and the Palestinians.”The churches in Israel, he says, have more heft than people imagine. Yes, there are “family problems”. But these days, the denominations are closer, and not averse to using soft power to make a point. When the city of Jerusalem recently announced a plan to tax church properties on which there are no houses of worship, a move the churches believed would affect some of their poorest (Arab) congregants, they took the unprecedented decision to close the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for three days in protest, a move that was reported across the world. It worked the municipality backed off. “We don’t want to become activists,” he says. “But here, politics is always involved.”For a while, we talk of Epiphany, a service, not many weeks away now, that is increasingly associated with the green movement. “We bless the waters and all creation,” he says. After this, he presses a buzzer, and in file two priests. They kiss his hand, and one hands him a slim parcel, which he then passes to me: a copy of a famous icon in the Greek Orthodox church in the Garden of Gethsemane. From beneath his kalimavkion – his veiled black hat – he beadily contemplates this visiting journalist from London. Possibly, she is a cynic. Almost certainly, she is godless. “Don’t always look at the past,” he says, with sudden firmness. “Look at the present. Where you see a plant flowering, that should be enough.” Halo must raise more money if it is to complete its work at Qasr al-Yahud next year. It’s his conviction that this will be forthcoming. These green shoots must be watered and He, or someone, will provide."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d646f3243f3554908925cba344a8299361dc702/2_0_10724_6436/master/10724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14b8aa611ec35207935f6e590b1e8198","title":"my boyfriend feels inadequate in bed compared with my previous lovers","story":"We were best friends for three years before getting together and I told him about the men I was seeing.

But it was when he discovered gong meditation sessions, otherwise known as sound baths, that he started transforming into the smiley, serene person he is today. He was so deeply affected by the practice that he ditched his singing and composing career, invested in some gongs of his own and embarked on a mission to pass on his newfound contentment to others. “I’m not saying I’m happy all the time,” he qualifies, “but I’m comfortable with life even when it’s really uncomfortable.”To find out exactly why banging a loud gong can have such a transformational effect on mind and body, I try out one of his sessions along with 20 other sound-bath novices. We gather on the top floor of a building near London Bridge with panoramic views of a sunset so dazzling it’s impossible not to sneak a phone snap, even though this feels unmindful and decidedly not in-the-moment. However, Cosendai remains characteristically nonjudgmental as he checks his three beautiful gongs are in order. Yoga mats are laid out with eye pillows placed at one end. Once we’re all reclined and quiet, the bright lights, noisy air conditioning and squeaky floor all feel amplified. Cosendai begins by listing these as things to simply notice and acknowledge, along with how our bodies feel on our mats, as he directs our awareness to the present moment.The sound bath itself is topped and tailed with Cosendai’s voice accompanied by the shruti box – often used to provide a drone sound in Indian classical music. His long, soft vocal tones meld into a spot of Mongolian overtone singing, in which he appears to sing two notes at the same time: a lower tone and a melodic whistle. However, the gongs are the main event, with a side order of conch shell for added ancient Tibetan vibrations. He weaves nimbly among us with his instruments to make sure we receive all sound frequencies from all directions and distances, creating added crescendos as he gets closer. The effect is a bizarre multi-layered wall of sound which, oddly, took me out of the city and made me feel as though I was in a cave.He bangs and rubs the gongs with big fluffy beaters, teasing out deep, reverberating, alien sounds that you feel in your bones. The overall effect is soothing, but it can sound eerie or dramatic at times, too. Like a really satisfying massage, some parts challenge your senses while others gently lull you into relaxation.While Cosendai says sound baths were developed by westerners in the mid 20th century, we have probably always used sound for therapeutic reasons. Although there have been no studies yet measuring the effects of sound baths on the brain, there are reams of neuroscientific literature on the effects of music per se.“It’s an ancient tradition to use sound to alter our state of consciousness,” says Elvira Brattico, Professor at the Center for Music in the Brain at Aarhus University in Denmark, who is planning to conduct the first scientific research into the effects of sound baths on the mind. “The shamans have done it with drumming,” she says, “and to use music as a medium to deepen a meditative state is quite common in different yoga practices.” But with gong meditation, sound is offered without the physical poses – you just lie on the matt and soak it up. A method that is keeping Cosendai very busy indeed.He is working seven days a week, from large one-off events (such as recent sessions at the Natural History Museum and London Fashion Week), to regular slots at yoga centres across London. His app Third Ear has 20,000 users and the audio book will be published early next year, recorded with “binaural” methods to render the sound in three dimensions. “Gongs produce a lot of harmonics,” says Cosendai, which is when we hear multiple tones in a single hit. “You get harmonics in everything, it’s just a question of how much of them you hear. While the piano sounds like one clear note to the human ear,” he says, “gongs are the number one harmonic-producing instruments. When you’ve got a lot of harmonics in the room, or on your headphones, they blend with each other, making baby frequencies if you like, and the more frequencies you have, the more your brain is activated in a different way.”With these different frequencies, he says, you hear what are called binaural beats, which is “when the brain receives information from two sound frequencies that are so close to one another, the brain brings them together and hears a beat”. The thronging effect of a bell or gong sound is produced by our brains.Brattico believes certain brain mechanisms observed in other music studies are also at play during gong meditations. One key effect, she says, is a process known as entrainment, whereby our brain waves synchronise with music. “Our neurons communicate with each other by oscillating,” says Brattico. “They fire rhythmically and there’s a particular frequency depending on how fast the oscillations are. The fastest oscillations are related to cognitive activity and motor activity, while slower ones are related to drowsiness and sleep and the deep sleep waves are very slow.” The low frequency of the gong sound, she says, may slow our neurons down towards the drowsiness and sleep zones.The rich soundscape of the wide harmonics, adds Brattico, can lead to a positive, relaxing experience, because “it allows you to detach from the cognitive part of the brain”. During Cosendai’s session, I become completely immersed to the point that the sounds seem to temporarily overrule my migraine, both distracting me and soothing me.The effect of the gong can create a strong emotional response, says Cosendai, and it’s not unusual for people to cry. Music certainly ignites introspection, says Brattico. “It activates a group of brain regions called the default mode network (DMN) which tends to be active when we’re not concentrating on anything and letting our minds wander.” The DMN is also connected to the reward system, allowing these self-referential thoughts, or even having a good cry, to become pleasurable experiences. This would explain why I don’t want the session to end it makes me feel good. “This combination of immersive and repetitive soundscape,” says Brattico, “might well trigger this experience of focussing on yourself. Having this in a very alert and active but relaxed state, detached from your worries and detractions, allows for a special meditative state.”On the surface, lying there and listening may seem more passive than other meditation practices, such as transcendental meditation, which involves repeating a mantra, or mindfulness, in which focussing on breathing is a key component. “A gong bath is a lot more free in that sense,” says Cosendai, “and that’s probably why the experiences, feelings and sensations people report vary”.While some of his clients tell Cosendai their bodies felt light, as though they were floating above the floor, for others the opposite was true, “So their bodies become heavy, almost as if they are part of the floor.” Either way, he says, gong baths shift our experience of space. “Typically the gong sounds can alter the spatial awareness of people,” he says, “which is really important, especially in cities where we’re so crowded.”One of the reasons Cosendai also uses his voice in his sessions is because, he says, “it brings a warmer more human element. The sounds can sometimes appear a bit eerie or unfathomable, maybe the voice before and after can really help. It’s a powerful instrument.”However, he says, the aim isn’t to merely bathe people in beautiful sounds. “It’s about what it does on the inside – what is revealed and what comes up and what you manage to feel, rather than having a sleep or feeling really relaxed. Otherwise, I’d send them to have a good back rub or something else.” He sees a sound bath as much more therapeutic. “This is why I’m doing it, he says. “It worked for me and I want to make sure it’s something available for people all over the world.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What did a weekend of sharing their most intimate stories teach them? In 2012, the Irish author Colum McCann and a group of fellow writers hit on an idea. They were at a festival in the US, and it started with a challenge they set themselves: “What is the highest aim of storytelling, and how can we harness that energy to transform our society?” They believed the stories they told had power – writers are not short of confidence – but could they change the world? McCann believed they could. Art for society’s sake.What emerged from that was an organisation called Narrative 4, which puts a story exchange between disparate, sometimes antagonistic groups at its heart. You pair up, swap stories from one another’s lives and then tell each other’s story back to the group in the first person. The theory is that telling someone else’s story will give you what McCann, who heads the organisation with co-founder Lisa Consiglio, calls “radical empathy”. For that moment, you become the other, possibly an “other” to whom you had previously been hostile.Narrative 4 is based in New York, where it has brokered meetings between schools with very different social mixes, and between pro- and anti-gun groups. In 2016 it moved into Ireland, setting up office in a disused library in Limerick. This is where, on a dry, bright weekend in the middle of November, 15 students from the Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, a school in the town that teaches all subjects in Irish, were introduced to 15 students from three schools in or near Birmingham: Holyhead in Handsworth Joseph Chamberlain sixth form college just south of the centre and Earls high school in Halesowen, a town to the west of the city.The weekend is coordinated by Ruth Gilligan, a novelist who was born in Dublin, lives in London and teaches creative writing at the University of Birmingham British author David Savill and Narrative 4’s regional director, James Lawlor, who keeps a gently watchful eye over proceedings. The theme is loosely “identity”, with Brexit as the inevitable background, but it quickly becomes apparent that teenagers live such intense, angsty lives that the tales they tell could go anywhere.That unpredictability is clear when the students are asked to write what they are curious about on a sheet of paper pinned to the wall. The organisers perhaps expect Anglo-Irish relations, Trump, nationalism – monochrome adult subjects. But the themes raised are truly technicolour: “Are there aliens?” “Is there a God?” “What happens after death?” “What language do people who are deaf since birth think in?” “Why doesn’t the hotel I’m staying in have Cadbury’s chocolate?” How can Brexit compete with these great existential questions?Gilligan and Savill explain to the group how to shape a story, and give them a quick guide to Irish and English history, and to some of the hostilities aroused by Brexit. But in the story-swap session, there are far deeper issues in play: loss, grief, the pressures put on teenagers, their urge to conform, the masks they have to wear to survive, their struggle to find themselves.They take the story exchange very seriously and respect each other completely, feeling the responsibility of telling their partner’s story. They then sit in a circle and tell their tales, one after another, with no applause or discussion until the end. It takes more than an hour, in which a lot of tears are shed, despite the competition from jolly seasonal music outside (it’s turning-on-the-Christmas-lights day in Limerick). Gilligan had supplied a small packet of tissues for the group I observe, but this turns into a packet-and-a-half session, surprising even her.It turns out that teenagers, on both sides of the Irish Sea, face many problems: there are stories of bullying, self-harm, eating disorders. The difficulties faced by the girls of Asian heritage in Birmingham, torn between a conservative community and a wider secular society, are the most severe. While the boys can lose themselves in sport, the girls experience the full force of cultural collision. The Limerick students, who are being taught in Irish and given a deep understanding of the country’s culture, seem more rooted, less challenged by conflicting identities, though still in some cases struggling with loss and questions of identity in the broadest sense. Who are they, why are they here, where does their Instagram self meet their real self?“It’s great to find you are not alone,” says one of the students, summing up the mood perfectly. “Life is unpredictable,” he adds – and at that moment, a drum roll suddenly booms out from the Christmas sound system in the street. Here are their conversations. Kishan Umesh Patel, 16, Holyhead school, Birmingham, and Emily Calton O’Keeffe, 16, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighEmily is a superconfident teenager who can’t stop laughing. She wants to be a pilot, and you can tell she’ll make it. Her story – about having an English mother and an Irish father, and being bullied at school because of it – touched on the key theme of the weekend: identity and the way you navigate it. “I struggle to fit in,” she tells me, “to find a place where I belong.”That gives her an immediate bond with Kishan, who was born in the UK to parents of Indian heritage. Both speak two languages: English and Irish in Emily’s case English and Gujarati in Kishan’s. Kishan opted for a jokey, sporty story about feeling cheated out of a trophy he thought his team deserved to win, but now says he wishes he’d been braver and told a more personal one. Perhaps about his religion and culture, which he fears are being chipped away. “I feel I’m British,” he says. “But I don’t want to forget that I’m Indian.”He says the weekend will leave its mark: “I thought it would just be like another school trip, but there was a lot more emotional depth.” In Emily, he has found an ideal match. “We talked for ages,” he says. “I think we talk fast.” “You find things in common,” Emily says. “But also things that were different,” Kishan adds. He means that growing up and going to school in Handsworth, a predominantly black and Asian area in north-west Birmingham, he didn’t have much trouble fitting in. As he talks, though, it emerges that he works at McDonald’s and customers regularly make racist remarks to him, which he never reports. “They’re usually drunk and I ignore them,” he explains, “or just don’t serve them.” Or spit in the burger, I suggest. Emily laughs again, pleased by the idea of revenge served with added relish.Emer Ryan, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Isobel Cooper, 15, Earls high school, HalesowenIsobel chose the only explicitly Brexit-related story of the weekend. “I’ve always been proud of being a citizen of Europe,” she says, “and I feel some people who are really small-minded have taken that away from me. I had no say in the matter, and my future is being decided by someone else.”Halesowen, the old industrial town in which she lives, voted to leave the EU. “There are a lot of older people there,” she says. “Not many young people. It’s quite a forgotten place in a way.” She says the sense of being ignored and left behind led to people scapegoating Europe. Her plan is to study German at university, and move to Germany if she can. One day she may even get her EU citizenship back. Inspired by her father’s interest, she says she loves Germanic culture and has enjoyed travelling there.Emer and Isobel clearly get on well – Emer already calls her new friend Izzy. “We found we could relate to each other,” Emer says of the story-swap group. “People go through things like loss and grief, and they all poured out.”“Going to school,” adds Isobel, “it’s easy to lose faith in your contemporaries and just think, ‘We have nothing linking us’, because some people aren’t very nice. There is so much ision between teenagers, between the different social groups. It was so nice to be in a room with people who didn’t care about all that, who were going to tell their story anyway.”Clementine Reed, 15, Earls high school, Halesowen, and Mercy Oweyo, 16, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighJust before the story-swap session, the participants were asked to write down something they were nervous about. Clem refused to write anything. “I’m not nervous,” she insisted. So it came as a surprise that her rendition of Mercy’s story was one of the weepiest of them all.At some point in the telling, the contrast between their stories struck Clem. Her tale, as told unflinchingly by Mercy, was of loving cricket from a very young age and excelling at it. Mercy’s story, as recounted by Clem, involved being born with brittle bone disease, feeling restricted and patronised all her life, having to use a wheelchair much of the time and then finding a voice, in every sense, when she started singing in a choir. Little wonder Clem found it so overwhelming.Born to a Nigerian mother who came to Ireland three years before she was born, Mercy speaks Yoruba to her mother, but has chosen to be educated in Irish. I ask whether she feels Irish or Nigerian. “Both,” she says, explaining that Ireland has been generally welcoming. She plans to go to university in Ireland and become a human rights lawyer.Clem says she’s enjoyed the weekend, but has never experienced anything quite as challenging. “Everyone else had been through a lot,” she says, “and I felt that I hadn’t really.” I assure her that’s a good thing – suffering is not a competition. But “When you meet people, you’re not aware of what they’ve been through,” she says. The amount of pain came as a shock to her the depth of her response to it, too.Danielle Hadnett, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Sameer Khan, 17, Holyhead school, BirminghamSameer’s story, as related by Danielle, was one of the most moving of all, and concerned the death of his elder brother in a road accident. “This is the story that defined my life,” Sameer said in the account he gave Danielle. Danielle’s was also a sad tale – about her grandfather’s death and the anxiety attacks that followed. But she had fought back. “I’m a soldier,” she said – or, rather, Sameer said for her – “and I will not give up.”Danielle and her sister are both at Limerick’s Irish school, even though her parents are non-Irish speakers. It makes for an intriguing home life – the sisters speaking to each other in Irish (sometimes useful, she says) and to their parents in English. Sameer’s parents are of Pakistani heritage, but his grandparents live in Russia and he was born in Holland. He grew up in Lowestoft and says he was the only “brown kid” in the class, picked on for his colour and because he couldn’t speak English. His family have lived in Birmingham since 2013. He seems relaxed and confident, and is perhaps a little overwhelming for Danielle, who has a natural quietness and reserve. But their battles unite them. “We are very different,” she says, “but also very alike.”Farzana Promi Ali, 18, Joseph Chamberlain sixth form college, Birmingham, and Muireann Ní Shé, 15, Gaelcholáiste LuimnighFarzana told the group, through her storyteller Muireann, that she had a tough time as an adolescent. She wanted to please her parents, her school, her friends. “I now know I’m never going to be perfect,” she says. “It’s been a struggle, but I’m getting through it. You have to find a balance. Over the years, I feel like I have found myself. I know what I like, I know what I don’t like, I know who I am.”She speaks Bengali at home. “Parts of me feel more British than Bengali,” she says, “but when I’m around my family, I feel more Bengali.” She was born in Bangladesh, but came to the UK when she was six months old and has spent all her life here.Muireann’s story was about being a fashion victim. She loves clothes, but disliked the way people were making her choose between fashion and study, as if a young woman couldn’t possibly be both fashion-conscious and academic. “There was pressure on me to be one or the other,” she says. “I wanted to be whatever I wanted to be, as many things as I wanted to be.”Her Irishness and the Irish language are at the heart of her identity. Unlike many at her school, hers is an Irish-speaking household. “I speak Irish to my father all the time,” she says. Her mother can speak Irish but less fluently, and Muireann usually speaks to her in English. And when they are all together? “It depends,” she says. “If we are in school mode, we will speak Irish.”Muireann’s grandfather passed Irish on to her father as his first language – hence his fluency – and she will continue the line. “By speaking it, we are keeping the language alive,” she says. “If we don’t speak it, it’s going to die. I’m a proud Irish person and it’s crucial to my identity. I will speak Irish to my own kids. I’m determined to do that. I’m going to keep it alive, even if it’s just for them.”Aaron O’Sullivan Riordan, 16, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Kadeja Tasnim, 17, Holyhead school, BirminghamAaron and Kadeja both conjured up powerful stories: his about being physically attacked by a boy who had once been his friend hers about having a sister who she discovered, at the age of eight, was really her cousin.“Being attacked was an important part of my life,” Aaron says. “Coming out of it made me a stronger person.” It was never clear why his friend attacked him – it may have been some sort of gang initiation, a demonstration of newfound toughness. “I was very confused about why he did it.” Kadeja says she found telling Aaron’s story very affecting. “I don’t even remember reading it or saying the words,” she says. “I just became him and I felt really emotional.” Her own story was equally strong. “I chose it because it’s about thinking you are someone, then losing your identity and trying to recover from it. You start questioning a lot of things and get confused.”Confusion is the lot of the teenager. “You are trying to find yourself, you put pressure on yourself, but then there is pressure in external places,” Kadeja says. She wants to be a writer her ambitious, Bangladeshi-born parents want her to be a doctor. Her father is a taxi driver and is determined to see his daughter rise in the world. I ask her who will win the occupational battle. “I will,” she says.Aaron and Kadeja have an easy rapport. Kadeja says she has come to embrace her Bangladeshi heritage as she’s got older, while Aaron is proud of his Irish identity. “People from other countries tend to see the Irish stereotype,” he complains. “We’re all alcoholics, ginger hair, leprechauns – and that’s irritating at times. It’s how Americans view us.” There is some truth to every stereotype, he says, but there are more interesting stories about modern Ireland lurking under the Blarney Stone.Eva McMahon, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh, and Hadiqa Ali, 17, Holyhead School, Birmingham“I thought it would be awkward,” Hadiqa says when I ask what she expected of the weekend. “But as soon as we started talking, it was OK.” Her story was a powerful one – of being criticised when she returned to visit her extended family in Pakistan for not wearing the hijab, and then labelled a hypocrite for wearing it when she came back to Birmingham. She felt she just couldn’t win.Eva says Hadiqa is “one of first Muslim people I’ve spoken to – it’s been a great learning experience for me. As I told her story, I became very emotional.”Hadiqa also had a learning experience. Eva’s story had been about Limerick winning the all-Ireland hurling tournament this year – for the first time since 1973. Hurling is a religion in Limerick – there is a statue of two hurlers in the high street – and this was a very big deal. It was even bigger for Eva, because her mother – a fan of the sport – was born in 1973 and has been waiting for this triumph all her life. Eva had shown Hadiqa a hurling DVD, and I ask Hadiqa if she now understands the sport and its quasi-religious status in this small, tightly-knit community. She rolls her eyes and looked perplexed. There are some gulfs that can’t be bridged.Simrat Kaur Bahra, 18, Holyhead School, Birmingham, and Marcus Cropper, 15, Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh“I’ve really enjoyed it,” says Marcus when I ask what he’s made of meeting the group from the Midlands, before wondering why he’s used a Northern Irish accent to answer my question. He is the group’s comic surrealist his story concerned a terrible year he’d had in which he developed a Nicolas Cage obsession to steer him through. He is one of only two boys among the 15-strong contingent from Gaelcholáiste Luimnigh. He reckons all the other boys at the school are spending the weekend obsessing about sport. In Marcus’s world, sport comes a distant second to box sets, preferably starring Nicholas Cage.Simrat is from an Indian background, is a practising Sikh and chooses to wear a turban. “It used to be that only men could wear it,” she says, “but women can wear it as well now. That’s a breakthrough in terms of our cultural tradition we’ve struck a blow for equality.”She is living proof that you can be true to your traditional religion and a representative of radical change. “I wear it to show that I’m not afraid of my background and where my parents are from,” she says. “I’m proud of it and it’s part of me.” She says she has occasionally experienced racism, but ignores it. “My faith is bigger than their derogatory comments.”Her story, as told by an emotionally charged Marcus, is about an upset within the family that led to a relative being bullied. Simrat found it hard to deal with and initially raged at God, but gradually made peace with her religion.She says she found the story exchange “profound”. “I learned a lot about people,” she says, “and about empathy. I see no difference between English teenagers and Irish teenagers. We all go through the same struggle.”• Commenting on this piece?

But the year he is reminiscing about now is 1994, when Sweden held its own in-out referendum on the EU. He voted no, but yes won by a sliver – so Sweden went in.“The country was ided and I was deeply disappointed. But a year later I began benefiting from membership of the EU, when I went to live and study in Ireland,” says Olsson, 47.He is holding out for a second Brexit referendum. “Over these past two years, a lot of people have realised that they have made the wrong choice, like I did. If Brexit goes ahead, ordinary people who are just about managing will be starving.”Just up the road Martin Lang, 61, works as a salesman at Conways DIY. He is of a different opinion. “I voted to leave in 2016 and would do the same today,” he says, “because of the amount of regulation we have to endure as a small business.” He is calling on MPs to back the prime minister’s deal. “Considering the opposition she has had from her own party, I think she has done remarkably well. I’m not a natural Tory voter, but I admire Theresa May.”Back on Buxton high street, Julie, 58, who works in retail and didn’t want to give her last name, says she voted to leave in 2016 because of the bureaucracy imposed by EU rules. “But if I had to vote again now, I would vote Remain, because it’s all been such a mess,” she says. Nicola Wallace, 24, who works at the University of Derby and has backed Remain from the start, agrees: “This whole process has been a disaster – and while the Brexiteers claim they can get a better deal, none of them are actually putting anything forward.”Other Labour MPs who have sought their constituents’ views include James Frith, Melanie Onn and Sharon Hodgson. All recorded recent net swings in their constituencies from Leave to Remain, as the reality of what the Brexit deal will look like has begun to set in.But, as the MPs acknowledge, voluntary surveys will tend to be filled in by the people who are most dissatisfied with the existing situation, and their findings are not representative. Onn says that “the vast majority of Grimsby residents still hold similar opinions as to when they voted in 2016. There has been very little shift and people’s patience is wearing thin.” National polling suggests that the results of another referendum would be too close to call. Despite this, senior Labour figures have set out a path towards endorsing a fresh vote on Brexit.If May’s deal is voted down on Tuesday – an outcome that seems inevitable – the party will seek to trigger a general election. If that attempt fails, Labour says it will call for a referendum on May’s deal. The question is whether enough Tory MPs will vote in favour of that.Back in Buxton, Sam Bastable, 34, sells his woodcraft designs at a stall inside the shopping centre. A Labour supporter, he backed Brexit in 2016, but if it came to a second referendum he is not sure which way he would vote. He supports freedom of movement and thinks May has negotiated a terrible deal. “It’s worse than what we have now,” he says. “I’m still in two minds about it all – because this is not the Brexit I voted for.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febbf430a9f25259735cfbb260cd73620e72ed2d/0_0_2216_1329/master/2216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ff42629416d40a49bcef2c192856adc","title":"cabinet split second referendum brexit","story":"PM’s plan heading for huge defeat as senior Tory suggests second referendum could be her ‘only chance’A deep cabinet split has opened up over whether Theresa May should back a second referendum in a final attempt to end the political deadlock over Brexit, as senior Conservatives predicted on Saturday night that her blueprint for leaving the EU was heading for a crushing House of Commons defeat.Adding to a mounting sense of constitutional crisis ahead of Tuesday’s crucial parliamentary vote, No 10 is braced for more resignations of ministers and aides who want another referendum, or who believe May’s deal fails to deliver on Brexit. Will Quince, the Colchester MP and aide to the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, quit his post on Saturday night in protest at the Brexit deal.Cabinet ministers have told the Observer that attempts to convince May to delay the vote to avoid one of the largest and most humiliating defeats in recent parliamentary history had not been heeded. This was despite what they saw as a clear danger that such a result could provoke a leadership challenge and split the party irrevocably. Some cabinet ministers now believe that May is so wedded to her Brexit deal that her only method of gaining approval will be through another referendum – and that the arguments for a second vote are emerging as stronger than those for a soft Brexit. The prime minister has so far refused to entertain any idea of a second public vote.Another senior Tory backing a second referendum said: “There are people in the cabinet who back a second referendum, but they are riding several horses so they don’t have to quit.”There is even talk among senior ministers that May should form a temporary government of national unity should she be defeated, as a “last throw of the dice” to find a majority for a Brexit plan that works.Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, broke ranks on Saturday to become the first cabinet minister to openly suggest alternatives to May’s plan. Rudd argued that a Norway-style soft Brexit could be the way through the impasse. She also said in an interview with the Times that she did not rule out a second referendum and made it clear that if there were to be one, she would vote remain.Writing on the  website, however, the justice secretary, David Gauke, dismisses both the Norway option and a second referendum, which he says would come with “great risks”. Strongly backing May’s deal, Gauke says a second referendum “is by no means guaranteed to be a silver bullet. In fact it is more likely to entrench ision and lead to at least a further year of damaging uncertainty.”Downing Street said it remained firmly opposed to a second referendum, and insisted the prime minister was focused on winning the “meaningful vote”. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, May warned Tory rebels that the country would be in “uncharted waters” if the deal was rejected with “a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal”. She also said voting down the deal would risk handing the keys of No 10 to Jeremy Corbyn.But a senior Conservative backbencher, aware of the level of opposition to May’s deal in the party, said there could be at least 100 Tory MPs who would not support her. A close ally of the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said a defeat on that scale would leave May no choice but to resign. “If it is under 50 she can probably go on and try to ask for concessions from Brussels, then put it back to a second vote. If it’s 50 to 100 it is more difficult but if it is over 100 it is impossible to see how she can carry on. People are already saying it is like the last days of Rome and it cannot go on like this.”In a further blow to the prime minister, the all-party select committee on exiting the European Union, which contains 10 Tory MPs, published a unanimous and scathing report on her deal on Sunday. The committee says many of the most important questions about the UK’s future relations with the EU have been left unanswered because of ministers’ unwillingness to confront key issues. The committee chairman, the Labour MP Hilary Benn, said the deal lacks clarity and would represent “a huge step into the unknown”.The committee unites behind a conclusion that “there are no realistic, long-term proposals from the government to reconcile maintaining an open border on the island of Ireland with leaving the single market and customs union”. As far negotiations on an UK-EU trade deal is concerned it says negotiations could be further delayed and complicated “because the government has yet to set out clear objectives for the future relationship that are realistic, workable and have the support of parliament”.On Sunday, the Tory MP Sarah Wollaston reveals a new strategy to secure cross-party backing for a second referendum. Rather than tabling an amendment to Tuesday’s main motion, as previously planned, she will launch a campaign to rally MPs behind a second vote if and when May’s deal is defeated. Tory MPs in favour of a second vote hope Labour will officially back the call allowing a parliamentary majority to be formed. Wollaston said: “If the vote in parliament goes ahead then, once rejected, I will be bringing a cross-party amendment at the earliest opportunity to press for a people’s vote. I urge the Labour frontbench to then stick to their promise to support it. No responsible government or opposition frontbench could knowingly unleash the dire consequences of crashing out with no deal and no transition and MPs on both sides must be realistic and honest with the public that no further concessions or alternative deals are on offer.”Downing Street revealed that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, will close the debate for the government on Tuesday evening. Voting will take place at 7pm. On Tuesday morning, the Speaker, John Bercow, will select up to six amendments to the main government motion that seeks approval for May’s deal. One of these – tabled by Benn and with strong cross-party backing – calls both for the deal to be rejected and for parliament to rule out a no deal outcome. Senior MPs believe that if the Benn amendment is chosen by the speaker and voted on before the main motion, it could be passed, meaning the government motion would be superseded. The effect would be a double defeat for May, and narrow her options down, as she would not be able to proceed towards a no deal. Some senior MPs say this will make a second referendum more likely.The Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said on Saturday night that May had to stay even if she was heavily defeated. “Whatever happens Theresa May must not resign,” he said. “The country needs her. No one can do any better. We need her to see it through. Nothing could be worse than a leadership contest while Brexit remains unresolved.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, speaking at a conference in Portugal attended by Jeremy Corbyn, on Saturday urged the Labour leader to back a second referendum. He said: “The Brexit vote was the lowest point in my political life. We respect the vote. But since that vote, much has changed in the world. And the EU has changed. Looking at the UK and having listened to Jeremy Corbyn and his plans, I have a question: Can you achieve what you want more easily as a member of the EU family or on your own?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d5e08e5688927ba9de005f99aab52742c276064/0_99_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e770964bf3c8532758b8234e4101d5fc","title":"theresa may brexit meaningful vote defeat","story":"Two days into the great Brexit debate, a Tory MP called Sir Robert Syms rose to his feet to address the House of Commons. Syms is not especially well known outside his constituency of Poole in Dorset and in normal times stays loyal. But at 6.40pm on Wednesday, with few MPs remaining in the chamber, the unsung 62-year-old announced with a heavy heart that he could not back the prime minister over her Brexit deal.“I am unhappy about voting against my government,” he declared. “I have been a member of parliament for more than 20 years. Since coming into government in 2010, I have voted against the government only once. This will be the second time. I hope that I never have to do it again because I believe that politics is a team game and I want my team to win and I want the prime minister to do the best for our nation. Unfortunately, though, I am a Conservative and unionist, and the backstop is something that I cannot accept.”For several weeks Theresa May has been holding private meetings in Downing Street and the Commons with MPs like Syms. She has used all her powers of persuasion to try to win them around ahead of Tuesday’s historic “meaningful vote” on her deal.Tory whips have tried to cajole their wavering backbenchers day and night, arguing the case for the May deal and reminding the more ambitious among them where their best career interests lie. Two weeks ago May made the campaign a national one – writing directly to the people of Britain and asking them to put more pressure on their MPs to support her.A special Tory website called Back the Brexit Deal was launched by the party to rally grassroots Tories behind the cause, with limited success. Constituency chairmen were lobbied heavily, too.The prime minister resigns after a humiliating defeat. Many MPs believe she will have to go if she loses by more than 100 votes. An interim prime minister would have to be chosen while the Tory party plans a leadership contest.May begs Michel Barnier, the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, left, to go the\u0026nbspextra mile and reopen the talks. She asks for\u0026nbspconcessions over the Irish backstop, and then puts whatever she can secure to a second vote in the Commons.Plenty of Conservative and Labour MPs would be happy to see a soft-Brexit, Norway-style solution that keeps Britain in the single market, as suggested by Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary. Although she has\u0026nbsppreviously rubbished the idea, May could do a U-turn and try to sell it\u0026nbspas a compromise to avoid the disaster of no deal.With her deal ditched, and if “no deal” is also ruled out by parliament, May’s least worst option could be to go back to the people. Many Tory MPs are pushing her to do so. If Labour officially backs the idea, a second referendum –as suggested by Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – could happen.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of exit from the European Union it wants, and if there is no majority for a second referendum, Britain hurtles towards a no-deal departure on 29 March 2019. A hardcore group of Brexiters led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg would rather accept trading with Europe on basic World Trade Organisation terms than May’s deal or any form of soft Brexit.If there is no agreement on anything, and “no deal” has been blocked off as an option by parliament, the other choice available is no Brexit. May or whoever is in charge could form a cross-party government of national unity, revoke Article\u0026nbsp50 and call the whole thing\u0026nbspoff.Ominously for the prime minister, however, the ultra-hard sell has achieved almost nothing. Some Tories even think it has had the reverse effect to that intended – making people focus in more detail on her deal than they would have done, only for them to conclude they could never back it.One senior Conservative said the party machine had deployed every resource it could muster but had failed totally. “Whether it is our backbenchers, or the party faithful, or the public, it is the same. If anything, I think the whole ‘going to the country thing’ has made things worse.”By this weekend more than 100 backbench Tory MPs had declared themselves ready to vote against May’s deal. Surveys of Tory members show they are against, too, by a big majority.After a dreadful week in which May’s government was found to be in contempt of parliament for refusing to publish the full legal advice on Brexit, the chief whip, Julian Smith, has been telling No 10 that it is on course for a huge defeat.Some cabinet ministers still loyal to the prime minister fear she will struggle to survive the humiliation of a three-figure loss on the most important issue to have faced parliament in decades, and are pleading with her to come up with a plan B to avoid total humiliation – or to buy time by delaying the vote. But they seem to have no idea of what she can do that would swing enough hardline Tory opponents of her plan behind it at the eleventh hour.The EU, meanwhile, insists the deal cannot be modified. Brussels says any attempt by the UK to seek substantive changes over the backstop or anything else at an EU summit in Brussels this week will be futile.More junior members of the government are rumoured to be ready to quit before Tuesday because they can’t live with the deal as it is.With two days to go, there is no sign May is ready to delay, change course or blink at all. One senior Tory said: “If she has a plan B, no one knows what it could be. It looks like a crisis with no solution. She seems ready to march on into the gunfire.”Labour is keen to make out that Tuesday’s vote will be tighter than everyone expects. It is desperate to promote this view in case May limits a defeat to far less than 100. If she did that she might just be able to take some comfort and argue to Brussels that with some extra concessions in her pocket she could take an improved deal back to the Commons before Christmas and get it through second time around.But with all but a handful of the 257 Labour MPs, the entire block of 35 SNP members, all but one of the 11 Liberal Democrats, and the 10 DUP members set to vote against it – and more than 100 Tories on record as being opposed – the arithmetic points to a far worse outcome for the prime minister.Since arguments over the UK’s future relationship with the EU began to grip Westminster more than a quarter of a century ago, the biggest, most important parliamentary votes have tended to be dramatic because they have been on a knife-edge.In July 1993 John Major lost a vote on the Maastricht treaty by just eight votes and then called a vote of confidence of the House. It is a measure of the crisis engulfing the prime minister and the country more than 25 years on that a defeat on that scale on May’s tortuously negotiated deal for leaving the EU would be regarded by everyone in Downing Street as a triumph beyond their wildest dreams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f5f1b0bef98bf9247da7b4ad93126628105631/0_222_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bec29b371c272516d324d9807ee3a094","title":"splits handbags and a remain poll what the sunday papers said about brexit","story":"Talk about the prospect of a second referendum is rife, along with that of a Corbyn governmentExclusives dominate Sunday’s coverage as the clock ticks down to a vote that is widely expected to possibly end in a heavy Commons defeat for Theresa May’s Brexit deal. The crystal balls are well and truly out as to what happens before, during and after that.The Mail on Sunday has an interview with May in which she warns party rebels it’s her deal or the double whammy of a Corbyn government and no-deal Brexit. She says Britain “would truly be in uncharted waters” if the deal is voted down, though some might say the UK is already well into that territory.The paper also suggests she might dash to Brussels this week to secure more concessions. May’s human side is demonstrated by the sidenote that she eats peanut butter straight out of the jar on stressful days.The Independent’s Sunday edition carries an exclusive poll by BMG Research suggesting December saw the Remain vote edging into a majority among the public after months of steadily rising support. Almost half of those polled think May’s deal is a bad one. Perhaps this was all part of the plan?The Sunday Times also says ministers are planning for a second referendum, but believes the prime minister can “handbag” Brussels into giving concessions (£) that will help her sell a version of her deal. The paper has a dewy-eyed moment, reporting cabinet sources as saying May needs to evoke Margaret Thatcher and get tough with EU negotiators. It reports the last-minute cross-border talks could mean Tuesday’s vote is delayed.The Sunday  goes in on the departure of aide Will Quince and the potential for more to leave in the next 48 hours. “May losing grip as party is rocked by resignations” is the headline. It says government whips have given Tory MPs until Sunday lunchtime to decide how they will vote and that May’s rivals are readying themselves. Boris Johnson is described as “focused” by friends, it says.The Sunday Express doesn’t have room on its front page for Brexit because of an exclusive about the potential for state control of nativity plays. It does however raise the prospect of “Corbyn by Christmas” on a handsome spread on pages four and five. It cites SNP sources as saying that could mean two new referendums: one to reverse Brexit and another on Scottish independence.The Sunday Mirror puts the “Tory uncivil war” on pages eight and nine, saying May is fighting for her job and agonising over whether to pull Tuesday’s vote.The Sun gives page two to its exclusive on May’s Westminster woes, saying Johnson is getting ready to save Brexit by Christmas. “Ho Ho Bo” is the headline. It also notes cod and chips will cost 50p more under May’s deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85bc3f7013fbbaa0125d031878747bee96fe9356/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d3e92854922b2f685ddf8b18fc8761","title":"peter hotez vaccines did not cause rachels autism india interview","story":"The American scientist, whose new book explains why vaccines didn’t cause his daughter’s autism, on why conspiracy theorists need to be challengedPeter Hotez is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. He has worked on developing vaccines for hookworm and schistosomiasis, and is a vocal opponent of the anti-vaccine movement. His daughter Rachel is autistic and he has written a book, Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel’s Autism, in which he describes her illness and tackles the newly resurgent anti-vaccine movement.Why did you decide to write this book through the prism of your own child?Well, I felt called to do it. I’ve written books about neglected tropical diseases, and here I was seeing these terrible things happening in Europe and the US, and if I didn’t do it – a vaccine scientist, paediatrician and autism dad – who else would?Cases of measles reached a 13-year high in 2008. What’s the situation today?I can bring up the numbers of the European centres for disease control. You have around 50,000 cases of measles in Europe in 2018. So it’s very concerning. There have been 1,019 cases in the UK between October 2017 and September 2018.Is there an established mortality rate for measles?There is, but it varies depending on underlying nutrition. But remember, it’s not just mortality there’s also permanent injury due to measles encephalitis, measles pneumonia, hearing loss, affected vision… The overall picture of measles goes beyond the fact that children can die.Thimerosal, a preservative with a tiny amount of mercury, has been removed from child and baby vaccines in the US and the UK, although there is no evidence supporting a link to autism…After the Wakefield paper was retracted, the new allegation that popped up came from Robert F Kennedy Jnr and others, claiming that it was the thimerosal. But it was removed from childhood vaccines and the rates of autism did not decline. There are also large-scale epidemiological studies showing that there’s no link between autism and thimerosal. What the anti-vaccine movement does is play this game of whack a mole: you knock one down and a new one pops up. It shifts from MMR to thimerosal to spacing vaccines too close together, to aluminium in vaccines, and it’s all garbage. None of those things cause autism. We’ve learned a lot about the neurobiology and genetics of autism to know that this is beginning prenatally, well before children ever see vaccines.So what does cause autism?There was a paper released just last week in bioRxiv identifying 99 genes associated with autism. Autism has a very strong genetic basis, which is not to say that there is no environmental impact, because we still have this phenomenon of epigenetics but if there is any environmental trigger it’s happening very early on in pregnancy, around the time of conception. This is not something that’s happening after children are born. These genes involved in creating autism are causing very complex rearrangements of the anatomy of the brain. The idea that a vaccine would do that is really just absurd.Is autism growing?The problem is that the diagnostic criteria for autism also shift. And then you have the added complexity that, often, for children to get special services from the school system they have to have the autism label. What used to be diagnosed as all sorts of things back in the 60s and 70s is now labelled as autism. The numbers are going to go up a lot more, because we’re getting much better at diagnosing girls and women with autism. We used to say it was 10:1 boys to girls, but now we’re recognising that many girls and women are on the autism spectrum but often it’s more subtle, because they’re more socially adept they can camouflage their autism better. But they have very high rates of co-morbidities like OCD or ADHD, or even eating disorders. A lot of girls with eating disorders may in fact be on the autism spectrum.Wakefield has relocated to Austin, Texas and there has been a drop in vaccination rates in Texas. Are those facts in any way related?It’s hard to know. Certainly this terrible false documentary that he’s been involved with – Vaxxed: From Cover-up to Catastrophe – hasn’t helped. How much Wakefield is a factor is difficult to estimate, because it’s grown so much bigger than Wakefield. We now in Texas have a whole political action committee (PAC) that’s anti-vaccine and raising money for candidates to run on anti-vaccine platforms. It’s happened in multiple states in the US. There are more than 480 websites that are anti-vaccine.There is evidence to suggest that it’s educated people who are leading this movement.As I like to say, educated enough to do a Google search, not quite educated enough to know what the hell they’re Googling.What’s driving it?That’s the most important question, and it’s one I can’t answer. There’s a lot of money behind this. Who’s paying for all this? It takes a lot of money to make PACs effective and put up all these anti-vaccine legislators.Is there evidence that the anti-vaccine movement is targeting vulnerable communities?Well, certainly we saw this in Minnesota last year, where they were absolutely predatory on the Somali immigrant community. They convinced them that vaccines cause autism and caused a horrific epidemic of measles.You suggest that the anti-vaccine movement is undermining care for autism. How does that work?One of the problems is that when the term autism is discussed in state legislatures in the US, and presumably in European parliaments, one of the first topics that then arises is vaccines. It distracts from the things we really need to focus on for kids and adults on the autism spectrum. Are they getting the special services they need? And then as adults, adequate job placements? Instead, the energy gets shifted to these false arguments about vaccines. So I think it’s been harmful to the autism community.You’re not sure whether Donald Trump has galvanised the anti-vaccine movement. But would you say he hasn’t supported the vaccination argument?He’s certainly not supported vaccinations, but in fairness to President Trump we didn’t get a lot out of the Obama administration and the Bush administration before that. Why have the US federal agencies been so silent about promoting vaccinations? I think when the anti-vaccination movement started in 1998 the federal agencies saw it as a cult movement and they thought it was best to ignore it. Unfortunately, they’ve largely continued that position even though the anti-vaccine movement is no longer fringe… it’s a full-blown movement affecting public health.How do you win an argument when empirical facts and scientific expertise are seen as inherently suspect by your opponents?There is a vacuum out there. While the anti-vaccine movement is very well-organised, well-funded, very adept at the use of the internet and social media, there has not been a response on the pro-vaccine side. So your question remains untested. I believe if there was a more active pro-vaccine lobby, most parents would listen to it. There are diehards who fully believe the conspiracy theory and you’re not going to reach those iniduals. But I think for the majority, you can reach them. That’s my motivation for writing the book.How do you see things developing with measles and other vaccines?Unless there is a well-focused and effective response, this thing is not going to get any better. All the signs are that it’s going to get worse. My big worry is that this is going global. The US and Europe are very good at exporting their culture, and now we’re exporting this garbage.

Pensioner poverty is rising, having fallen steadily for nearly two decades, the charity said. The figures prompt fears that many pensioners will be forced to choose between paying for heating and buying food this winter, as benefits remain frozen below inflation for the third year in a row.The foundation’s chief executive, Campbell Robb, said: “Pensioner poverty is a problem that we thought had gone away.”The problem is compounded by the benefits freeze, in place since 2016. “As rent goes up faster than housing benefit, pensioners have a huge gap to fill,” Robb said. “This tips people into poverty, and forces them to choose between food and heating.”The foundation called on the government to end the benefits freeze and to build genuinely affordable housing. “These figures are part of a wider increase in poverty across all age-groups,” said Robb. “If we don’t tackle the causes now, we fear that we are going to see poverty – particularly among pensioners – rise even more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/014e2661a13689705a7575acb4345c2a3a75a5f2/0_158_4057_2435/master/4057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12ea8fa60b2804b6ea9ef627d50e7ae9","title":"premiership rugby relegation and promotion","story":"• Nigel Melville suggests geographical spread of clubs• Premiership still wants to ringfence itselfThe Rugby Football Union has proposed expanding the Premiership to 16 teams – split into two conferences – to resolve the continuing debate over promotion and relegation.Nigel Melville, the interim RFU chief executive, believes a move towards an American model, iding the league along geographical boundaries, would answer the long-standing issue of whether to ringfence the Premiership. He also believes doing away with the Premiership Rugby Cup – largely a development competition – and reducing the number of professional players in England would be of long-term benefit.“If you look at the NFL, they don’t have a cup competition. They focus on their core business. We’ve got nearly 1,200 professional players in the country and maybe the reason is that we’ve got so many competitions going on with elite players. That’s money going out of the game. It’s not going into infrastructure. Maybe we get down to 1,000 or 800 players.”The Premiership clubs have recently refocused their efforts to ringfence the league, with so many established teams in danger of going down this season. The age-old problem remains, however – there are 13 shareholders (the current Premiership plus London Irish) – but such is the fear among sides such as Bath, Leicester and Northampton of going down that they have considered a push for ringfencing the league at 13.This would stifle the ambitions of the handful of Championship clubs who want to join the top flight – namely Ealing, Yorkshire Carnegie, Doncaster, Coventry and Cornish Pirates – but Melville’s proposed model would address that issue partially. It would also mean the Premiership clubs would have to ide their shares by 16, rather than 13 as they do now, but with CVC’s £240m impending investment that would be less of stumbling block for the owners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6503e7bef64ba189f446482d40bc1a27ce714071/0_176_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dead24e03f10490b76d0d849195d0fb4","title":"australia face near impossible first test task as hopes rest on marsh","story":"Australian cricket’s whipping boy Shaun Marsh shapes as his side’s best hope of winning the first Test against India which history - and conventional wisdom - suggests is near-impossible.Australia, set an imposing target of 323 at Adelaide Oval, reached 104-4 at stumps on day four.Marsh is unbeaten on 31 from 92 balls, having occupied the crease for more time than any other batsman in Australia’s second innings, while Travis Head is 11 not out.Marsh has history when it comes to resisting India, having batted out 62 overs on day five to help secure a draw last year in Ranchi.The 35-year-old is also likely to draw confidence from negotiating Sunday’s final session plus last month’s Sheffield Shield knock of 163 not out in Adelaide, where he helped Western Australia to overhaul a target of 313.But the mountain confronting the much-maligned veteran on Monday is significantly more confronting for several reasons, with Australia still 219 runs away from a record-breaking victory after suffering a concerning collapse of 56-4.The highest-successful run chase in an Adelaide Test is Australia’s 315-6, achieved in 1902 against England, while no side has hunted down more than 236 at the venue since West Indies in 1982.India’s prospects of recording their first Test win in Australia since 2008, and their maiden Test series win in Australia, were already strong when resuming on Sunday at 151-3.They were enhanced by first-inning centurion Cheteshwar Pujara, who top-scored again with 71 to make it 11 hours at the crease in the low-scoring contest.Nathan Lyon grabbed 122-6 as India posted a second-innings total of 307.Loose strokes from Marcus Harris, Usman Khawaja and Peter Handscomb served as the latest reminder of Australia’s reliance on Steve Smith and David Warner in recent years.The slump started when Aaron Finch ended the post-lunch session, caught at bat-pad for 11.Replays suggested the ball didn’t flick the gloves, meaning Finch would have been reprieved if he had reviewed.Finch had already referred a lbw verdict in the first over of the innings, only avoiding the ignominy of a pair because replays showed Ishant Sharma delivered a no-ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11342c11760ce38c4600624f03fbb44573167b1/0_109_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a70be7418f59aefcec221edf6104ea","title":"australia v india first test day four live","story":"Here’s your match report:After three days of attritional cricket the first Test exploded into life on Sunday with 11 wickets falling during three sessions that all-but eliminated the possibility of a draw. India began the day confidently and looked set for a huge lead before a suicidal collapse saw them plummet from 234-3 to 307 all out. Some of the dismissals would have seemed absurd in T20, let alone a Test match with almost two days remaining. Che Pujara’s 71 and Ajinkya Rahane’s 70 were the main contributors to India’s imposing 323-run advantage but Rishabh Pant’s 16-ball 28 best summed up the chaos. Nathan Lyon’s ill fortune of days past was forgotten as he picked up six second-innings wickets.Australia’s run-chase has been peculiar. In large part the application to grind towards the target slowly has been admirable, but in amongst the studious defence have been enough poor attacking shots to account for three top order batsmen, while Aaron Finch gave himself out without obviously gloving a bat-pad catch. Play will start half an hour early tomorrow (10am local time) meaning a positive result one way or another is inevitable. If this pair make it through to the second new ball, who knows? Perhaps the redemption of Shaun Marsh may yet be the feelgood hit of the summer.Join Adam and Geoff (and potentially me, if we get to a third session) tomorrow for the conclusion of this engrossing contest. 49th over: Australia 104-4 (Marsh 31, Head 11) Travis Head compactly defends the final over the session from Jasprit Bumrah and the players leave the field following the most eventful day of this Test. 48th over: Australia 104-4 (Marsh 31, Head 11) Ashwin returns but it’s a nondescript late-in-the-day over notable only for a single to Head. There has been some scintillating correspondence recently. What took you all so long to fire up?47th over: Australia 103-4 (Marsh 31, Head 10) Marsh keeps on keeping on and despite focussing on defence he is alert enough to accept a leg-stump half volley and dispatch it for four. Marsh has now been at the crease for 88 deliveries. “Greetings Jonathan,” howdy Kim Thonger. “Glancing at the Sunday morning headlines here in England, and the scorecard in Australia, it seems to me that the only entity in more trouble than the Australian cricket team at this particular moment in the entire universe, is Theresa May’s government. Also, my autocorrect just suggested cruckrat as a correction for cricket, which I had typed incorrectly. Does anyone know what a cruckrat is? I’m too weary to google it.” 46th over: Australia 99-4 (Marsh 27, Head 10) More to report from Vijay’s second over, one that begins with a jaffa spinning beyond Head’s outside edge and includes a well-timed glance from the same batsman for three and a late cut for two. 45th over: Australia 93-4 (Marsh 26, Head 5) Bumrah is back for a bowl, which is a reassuring sight following his awkward fall earlier this afternoon. He doesn’t look completely free though and more than once reaches for his non-bowling left shoulder between deliveries. Such is Australia’s mindset even a modest over is rewarded with a maiden. 44th over: Australia 93-4 (Marsh 26, Head 5) After 18 overs 243 Ashwin is given a rest, Murali Vijay accepting spin-bowling duties. Marsh calmly strokes a single before Head drops anchor in an unremarkable over.43rd over: Australia 92-4 (Marsh 25, Head 5) What curse? Marsh calmly glides Shami behind square for a single to bat superstition into a cocked hat. Head, drunk on the fumes of Marsh’s run, then cuts a lesser-spotted boundary behind point. This is a positive tsunami of scoring. “I want to complain that  has a direct link to a scorecard and I now have nothing to complain about.” Oh, Andrew Vicars, you can’t be trying hard enough, there is plenty to complain about a recently retired former Australian Rules footballer commenting on French domestic policy on television news for a start. 42nd over: Australia 87-4 (Marsh 24, Head 1) More dots than The Windmills at Overschie as 87 refuses to budge. Ashwin with another maiden, Head this time comfortable preserving his wicket with little ambition to advance the score. 41st over: Australia 87-4 (Marsh 24, Head 1) As figures of eight overs two for ten would suggest, Shami has hit an impeccable line and length this innings. Once again he forces Marsh into his shell, almost capitalising on the run drought by throwing a wider tempter that the batsman almost chops onto his stumps. 87 lives on until at least a 13th delivery. Nine overs or half an hour remaining in the day. 40th over: Australia 87-4 (Marsh 24, Head 1) Head sees off an Ashwin over fired into the footholes from over the wicket. The dreaded 87 lingers. 39th over: Australia 87-4 (Marsh 24, Head 1)  Another tight Shami over keeps Marsh in defensive mode but a late single invites Head on strike and he gets off the mark with a clipped single to fine-leg. The over ends with Australia on the dreaded 87...38th over: Australia 85-4 (Marsh 23, Head 0) Marsh picks up a single off another tight Ashwin over but it’s an over dominated by an awkward e from Bumrah that looks to have done the paceman a bit of damage. He has left the pitch nursing his left arm. 37th over: Australia 84-4 (Marsh 22, Head 0) India have plugged away for 37 overs without sending down anything unplayable. They have still snagged four top-order wickets, which says plenty about Australia’s issues right now. Bowling change with Shami replacing Ishant and it works! After a series of full and straight deliveries Shami drops short but Handscomb can’t execute the pull, mistiming an attempt high on the splice of the bat and lobbing a simple catch to midwicket. Another promising innings ends tamely for Australia. India must think they’re almost home now. 36th over: Australia 84-3 (Marsh 22, Handscomb 14) Ashwin hasn’t bowled many grenades in his now 15-overs but he lands one in the rough outside Marsh’s leg stump that takes off. The bowler has moved over the wicket to the left-hander after previously operating around. He rattles through a quick maiden, the second in succession. 35th over: Australia 84-3 (Marsh 22, Handscomb 14) Maiden over, bowled by Ishant, defended by Handscomb. The approach to the Victorian is still full and straight with a hint of inswing but the batsman has been up to the task so far. For the record, my perfect scenario at the end of today would involve a pint of Guinness and a bacon-loaded cheeseburger. 34th over: Australia 84-3 (Marsh 22, Handscomb 14) Ooooh! Handscomb escapes after clipping Ashwin powerfully straight into the hands of short leg, powerfully enough for the fielder not to hang on. Tough on the fielder, one of those that might stick occasionally and would count as a bonus if it did. Meanwhile Marsh has played his way out of his funk, nudging a couple of singles and then using his feet to meet a wider Ashwin delivery on the half-volley and clobber it through the covers for a rare boundary. 33rd over: Australia 78-3 (Marsh 17, Handscomb 13) More runs for Handscomb, three this time from Ishant’s latest over, using the bowler’s angle from wide of the crease into his pads to his advantage. Marsh continues his real-time form decline, suffering a blow to his bottom hand from a delivery that climbed on him more than he expected. 32nd over: Australia 74-3 (Marsh 16, Handscomb 10) Once again Handscomb rotates the strike nicely against Ashwin with Marsh content to dab away the remainder of the over. After that brisk start Marsh is becalmed.With 19 overs left in the day the final drinks break is taken. 31st over: Australia 73-3 (Marsh 16, Handscomb 9) Ishant Sharma returns for his second dart after a miserly five-over spell from Bumrah. Ishant’s second delivery is a beauty, jagging in off the seam and striking Handscomb in the midriff as he jackknifes out of the way. The follow up is the obvious wicket-ball, full and swinging in, targeting Handscomb’s deep guard with late movement, but the Victorian is alive to the danger. 30th over: Australia 72-3 (Marsh 16, Handscomb 8) Australia use their feet much more to Ashwin this over and they profit by rotating the strike three times to keep the bowler adjusting to the right-hand  left-hand combination. There are 118 overs remaining in this one. 29th over: Australia 69-3 (Marsh 15, Handscomb 6) Bumrah strikes Marsh on his front thigh from around the wicket in what might be the under-fire Australian’s first false shot, 33 deliveries into his innings. The rest of the maiden over is made up predominately of leaves as India continue to rack up the dot balls. 28th over: Australia 69-3 (Marsh 15, Handscomb 6) Ashwin does his best to tempt Marsh into a rash stroke but a scampered late single is the only thing of note in a quick over. 27th over: Australia 68-3 (Marsh 14, Handscomb 6) Handscomb pulls Bumrah for the first boundary in an age, adjusting quickly to a rare shorter ball in an over otherwise on a good length. Jason Gillespie has just compared Handscomb’s technique to England’s Gary Ballance, for anyone playing along at home without vision wondering how deep in his crease the Australian batsman stands.26th over: Australia 64-3 (Marsh 14, Handscomb 2) Marsh has been proactive since his arrival at the crease, defending, attacking and running with purpose. He advances his score by two from this Ashwin over and looks in the best nick of any Australian we’ve seen so far today. 25th over: Australia 62-3 (Marsh 12, Handscomb 2) Bumrah is full and straight at Handscomb, targeting his obvious weaknesses - bowled and LBW - but the batsman is up to the task, playing with a straight bat for five deliveries then working with the bowler’s natural angle for two through midwicket. 24th over: Australia 60-3 (Marsh 12, Handscomb 0) This has not been a vintage display form Australia thus far. Can they survive the day?Gah! Khawaja looked like he walked out to bat with ants in his pants and his dismissal comes as little surprise. Ashwin caught the Australian advancing, deceived him in flight, meaning when the ambitious drive was launched it was inevitably a streaky edge. The ball went high and spinning towards deep cover where three fielders converged and Rohit took a very good ing catch. 23rd over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 8, Marsh 11) Better from Khawaja, leaving plenty and defending securely from the crease during this Bumrah maiden. 22nd over: Australia 59-2 (Khawaja 8, Marsh 11) Khawaja is not in his happy place quite yet. After being deceived by Bumrah he chases a couple of Ashwin’s shadows in a skittish over. One sashay down the crease in particular almost ended in a host of dismissals and betrayed the confusion in the batsman’s method. 21st over: Australia 57-2 (Khawaja 7, Marsh 10) Bumrah replaces Shami from the Cathedral End and he begins a fun duel with Khawaja. The batsman survives, and picks up a couple with a nice glance to leg, but he’s also beaten on outside and inside edges with Bumrah making the ball move seam off the pitch just enough to provoke some false strokes. There is something aesthetically pleasing about watching a right-arm bowler make the ball move away from a left-handed batsman from around the wicket. 20th over: Australia 55-2 (Khawaja 5, Marsh 10) Marsh looks switched on early in his innings and he brings up Australia’s 50 with a cut so late it was posthumous*, angling Ashwin away to the third-man boundary. He repeats the trick for two later in the over to reach double figures in quicktime. Ashwin has yet to settle on his length. He’s coming around the wicket to the two lefties, meaning he doesn’t have the rough to aim for that Lyon used to such great effect. *I know I’ve appropriated this from somewhere, can anybody tell me where?Marcus Harris’ twin 26s on debut is making for statistical merriment. I caught this as the players were leaving for the Tea interval. Very “DAN! DAN! DAN! DAAAAAAN!” areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef51b9fb91da149469c6453cec5883543322f998/0_178_5236_3142/master/5236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22b905a232c810198e363e8af876d8c9","title":"the observers best christmas shows of 2018","story":"From veteran dames to festive circus arts (and wicked queen Dawn French) the Observer’s critics pick your top ticketsJill Murphy’s stories have sold more than 5m copies worldwide and been made into numerous screen adaptations.

The Royal’s relationship with the classical canon has been ambivalent in recent years, with The Sleeping Beauty looking especially neglected, but their curation of The Nutcracker has been unimpeachable, and the ballet is in every sense a delight. There’s Tchaikovsky’s beautiful score, wonderful dances by Wright based on Lev Ivanov’s original choreography, and the enchantment of the 19th-century Nuremberg setting (designs are by Julia Trevelyan Oman).In the townhouse where the Stahlbaums are entertaining, all is firelit warmth. Adults watch as children tear open their presents. There are party games, a conjuring show, and angels fashioned from gingerbread and marzipan. It’s a dream of Christmas past. As the magician Drosselmeyer, a role he has played for many seasons now, Gary Avis has achieved national treasure status, and Anna Rose O’Sullivan is vivid and bright-eyed as Clara, the teenager whose transformative dream-journey the ballet describes. Her Nutcracker, as charming as the day is long, is the spring-heeled Marcelino Sambé. The corps whirl and swirl as snowflakes, the ertissements are dashed off with elan – Fumi Kaneko inscribing lovely lines in the air as the Rose Fairy – and the grand pas de deux is rendered with flawless grandeur by Marianela Nuñez and Vadim Muntagirov.Trevelyan Oman’s designs reproduce those of the Biedermeier era, the years of peace and prosperity in central Europe that followed the Napoleonic wars and the 1815 Congress of Vienna. It was in this early Victorian period, when the gaze of the middle classes turned from politics to the ordered pleasures of family life, that ETA Hoffmann’s original Nutcracker story was set. Given its bourgeois preoccupations, it’s tempting to view the Biedermeyer era as idyllic, but waiting in the wings of this particular idyll are the figures of the poor. For every Clara opening her presents beneath the Christmas tree, there’s a Little Match Girl freezing to death in the street outside.There’s a melancholy strain in Tchaikovsky’s score that seems to recognise this shadow aspect, and in his 1992 version of The Nutcracker, set in an orphanage, Matthew Bourne responds with characteristic insight. The privilege of the few, he shows us, is always dependent on the exploitation of the many, and this knowledge enables us to view the Royal Ballet’s production in a more equivocal light. In the nooks and crannies of the Stahlbaums’ house live the mice, a near-invisible population surviving on the scraps from the family table. Decimated by traps, suppressed by the establishment’s tin soldiers, the mice suffer defeat when Clara, impelled in equal parts by girl power and class assertiveness, thwacks their king (Nicol Edmonds) on the head with her pointe shoe.Much as I love the Royal’s Nutcracker, I’m always a little saddened by this outcome. I much prefer the mice, with their cutlasses and whiskery swagger, to the repressive, rifle-toting soldiers. I live in hope that maybe, one day, the mice will win. What adventures might Clara have then?• The Nutcracker is in rep at the  Royal Opera House, London, until 15 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ff9f903813d0b123e7015d2fb21bdd394aabba4/0_46_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=003ab1423400f089aa13ca3092610eda","title":"how hot dogs got haute fashions fast food love in","story":"From the humble grilled cheese sandwich to classic burger and fries, Anna Hart discovers how comfort food is getting a luxury makeover as part of our everyday extraordinary series.

For modern diners, going for a burger is a quest. A quest for excellence: gastronomic, ethical and aesthetic excellence. In cities around the globe, dishes that would once have been termed fast food – pizza, grilled cheese sandwiches, tacos and hot dogs – are being taken as an art form, with fiercely loyal cult followings on social media and five-star newspaper reviews by food critics previously accustomed to starchy tablecloths and foamy, fiddly haute cuisine offerings. On Twitter and other social media platforms, diners furiously debate the merits of a Bleecker burger over a Patty \u0026amp Bun burger on the Mexican front, Breddos and DF Mexico vie for the crown of best tacos in London, and the gloves are off between devotees of Pizza Pilgrims and Franco Manca.This is the golden age of flash food – poshed-up fast food – when the most sought-after meals around the UK are sophisticated versions of simple staples.“I think haute cuisine has been put in its place,” says chef Gizzi Erskine, author of Slow: Food Worth Taking Time Over. “We now take comfort in simple dishes that mean something to us, that may have been pushed to another level from technique and ingredients. Plus, we care much more about the ingredients – provenance, breed and how things are farmed – so there’s a new understanding that a great piece of meat cooked simply is enough.”A menu is one of the most telling barometers of any society, indicating our shifting aspirations, economic circumstances, ethical and health preoccupations and how we choose to socialise. “This is definitely a sociological trend as much as about food tastes,” says Damien Gabet, editor of Square Meal magazine. “It’s no longer cool to shout about that Michelin-starred meal you ate off starched tablecloths, but there’s cultural capital to be gained from going out and Instagramming a meal from the most hyped food truck in town.”Social media has significantly fuelled the trend for superlative versions of simple dishes. “Fine-dining fare doesn’t actually photograph that well and generally looks fussy and drab,” says Gabet. “Whereas, dishes such as tacos and burgers have distinct outlines and vibrant colours.”In London, few figures have done more to champion affordable new restaurants, informal supper clubs and food trucks than Clerkenwell Boy, an anonymous food influencer with close to 200,000 followers on Instagram (@Clerkenwell_Boy). “I started Instagramming to try and make food more accessible and less elitist,” he says. “Because, while there is a place for special-occasion fine-dining, on a Tuesday night with friends, we generally want affordable but delicious meals served family-style, in a no-frills setting but with relaxed and friendly service.”And while we might be dining out more, this doesn’t mean we’re lowering our standards. “If we go out for a burger, we want it to be the best burger in town,” says Clerkenwell Boy. “We want to eat simply, but we want it to be the absolute best version of that dish.”As Trish Caddy, Mintel’s senior foodservice analyst, puts it: “Millennials – the generation most likely to consider themselves as ‘foodies’ – have developed an acquired taste for artisanal flavours such as dry-aged meats and smoked cheese, partly out of a desire for visceral, intense experiences that stimulate their senses.”And although consumers are increasingly health-conscious, there’s also been a shift in what we consider an “unhealthy” meal. Burgers and pizzas are no longer demonised there’s a new understanding that excessive sugar, sweeteners, additives and heavy processing are the real culprits in poor health and obesity.“So, instead of eating low-quality processed meats such as fatty pepperoni and sausages, millennials are seeking out functional ingredients like fermented foods that tap into the ongoing gut-friendly food trend,” says Caddy. “For example, sourdough pizzas, which feature purported health benefits that come from the fermentation process, have a distinctive sourness compared to ordinary pizza bread dough. This suits millennials, who have grown accustomed to food with intensive flavours as well as health benefits.”And if diners are rediscovering simple pleasures, the good news is that these dishes are also immensely satisfying to prepare. “Cooking should be about everything from sourcing great ingredients to the therapeutic rituals of breaking down the recipes,” says Erskine. “And everyone should be able to eat, and cook, this way.”The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

All images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Stephanie Sian SmithVibrant, arty and home to one of London’s most erse communities, Peckham has cemented itself as a true cultural hotspot – with creative hub Peckham Levels, the legendary Bussey Building and no shortage of galleries and cafes just a few of its draws. But long before SE15 was named by Time Out as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, it was the stomping ground of blogger and best-selling author Chidera Eggerue.With 187,000 Instagram followers, Eggerue is now known globally by her online moniker, the Slumflower – a name borrowed from Street Etiquette’s concept of a rose growing from concrete. Her debut book, What a Time to be Alone: the Slumflower’s Guide to Why You Are Already Enough, is now in its third print run and she has recently published her second, Scribble Yourself Feminist. Growing up in south-east London, Eggerue mirrors the Slumflower message of growing, glowing and flourishing in an urban environment. Here, she presents her very personal guide to Peckham, reflecting on the everyday extraordinary places that fire up her imagination …Taste some proper Nigerian foodI live with my mum and two brothers and I don’t really eat out much as my mum is an amazing cook. She makes jollof rice, egusi (a type of melon seed) soup, beans and yam. She also shops local and buys her meat and vegetables from the market in Peckham.But if you want to know a good Nigerian restaurant in the area, I would suggest 805 Restaurants – I get plantain and jollof rice. Afterwards, stop by Cafe Spice, a small, yellow shop opposite the Bussey Building. Look out for a Nigerian snack called a puff puff, which is very sweet and like a fried doughnut.Kick back with a drinkJohn the Unicorn is really nice, or Prince of Peckham – it does great chicken, and has really good DJ sets and there’s a party room upstairs. It’s quite new but it’s where I’d go with friends now. People do of course go on to club nights at the CLF Art Cafe – known locally as the Bussey Building (during the summer months there’s a rooftop bar and cinema), but I’m like an 80-year-old granny and just go home!Head to the only cinema worth knowing aboutOnce a month I take myself on an evening date to watch a film at Peckhamplex. I’ve been going there since I was born and it’s still the only cinema I go to – at a fiver a ticket, you can’t go wrong. I saw the new Incredibles film recently, which I loved it was so cute. Going there and having time to myself is important. What is now above it – the creative workplay hub that is Peckham Levels – used to be a multi-storey car park. My dad used to park there before we went to the cinema and he’d whizz around the levels, it was so much fun. Frank’s Cafe is there now, on the rooftop, but it’s not really my thing.Look out for inspiring wall artWhen I was younger, there was a wall by Peckham library with photos of famous black actors, who I very much aspired to be. The bus I took to secondary school went past it, so I’d see them every day from age 11 to 16. Now the murals are on the walls of the Peckhamplex, which I love.Hit up my beauty go-tosPaks Hair and Cosmetics is where I get my hair treatments, conditioners and extensions. I also go to Anna’s nail shop once a month to get my nails done. (Find it in Ali Baba’s barber shop on 127 Rye Lane.) It’s £25 and quite expensive. I always get pointy nails shellac all the way. I get the brightest, neon colours I can. My tip? Get Anna’s son to do them – he’s the best.Get a coffee fixI get my coffee at the Costa on Rye Lane every day, but it’s not very Peckham! It used to be a Mothercare. My mum would always go in there with me and just the other day I was looking at an old film of me in there, which we still have on tape. There was more footage of me in my pram and walking through Peckham. There were green buses then – they were so cool – and the McDonalds is in shot, which is still there.Find some headspaceSexby Garden in Peckham Rye Park is my hideout, my reflection spot – my secret favourite place. It is a part of Peckham that not many people know exists. The lavender is beautiful and it’s where I sit and think everyday.Discover a local secretPeckham has a golf course! Aquarius Golf Club is massive and nearer the Honor Oak side. You wouldn’t know about it unless you’re from Peckham.When you’re finished in Peckham …Take the Overground to citizenM Hotel, Shoreditch – it’s my favourite spot to meet people in London, partly because it has a really cute balcony, epic music and the coziest ambience.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

From rethinking your routine to noticing art and culture around you, as part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, here are 10 ways to appreciate the magic of the everyday. All images captured on Google Pixel 3Most of us are settled into our routines. Wake up, check emails, grab a coffee, hop on the train, get to work. It’s not our fault, it’s the efficient way that our brains work. “Having this autopilot mode allows the conscious mind to be freed up for other tasks,” says Gemma Griffith, a director at the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at Bangor University.However, autopilot mode can have its downsides. By being so wedded to our ingrained habits and routine we can risk becoming disconnected from other people and our surroundings, and missing out on everyday magic. For Griffith the remedy is simple: “It’s about switching back to ‘being’ mode rather than ‘doing’ mode and focusing our attention on the present moment”. Here are 10 ways to shake up your routine and relish the everyday.Take time outYou don’t have to trek to the top of a mountain to find inner peace. Whether you’re on your commute or taking a lunchtime stroll, take the time to open up your awareness. “Focus on your walking, how your feet feel on the ground, the temperature of the weather at that moment, and the sounds you hear,” says Griffith. Coax your mind into the present moment by taking a different route home or trying out a new lunch spot.Be more basicFashion’s love affair with utilitarian dressing continues, with pared-back basics the lynchpins of Instagram’s most followed fashion icons. “The current appetite for streetwear and the rise of high-street stores that specialise in stocking classic key items, such as brands like Arket, prove that the trend for basics is going nowhere,” says stylist Laura Martin. The humble white t-shirt, the classic hoodie and ordinary gym trainers have never been more on trend. The good news is, they’re probably already in your wardrobe.Rethink your favourite foodsThe internet has turned eating into an art form. While home chefs could once have lived a lifetime using only Mrs Beeton’s Cookery Book for company, today we are googling ambitious dishes then feverishly photographing and hashtagging the results. But have we forgotten the simple pleasure of ordinary meals and ingredients? As the zeitgeist turns towards a balanced approach to eating, bloggers such as the Ugly Vegan are performing the seemingly revolutionary act of sharing unfiltered, familiar dishes. For your next evening in, why not grab a bag of imperfect veg and create something extraordinarily ordinary?Notice art around youYou don’t have to go to a gallery to appreciate great art and design: seek out signs of creativity all around you. If you’re in London, look up Art on the Underground’s Brixton mural map, leading to examples of street art in the area dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. Based in Manchester? Check out the street art tours on offer by writer Hayley Flynn, who set up bespoke tours of the city to put a spotlight on the local landscape of the Northern Quarter, which is packed with rich history. Over in Bristol, the tourist office has published free, downloadable walking tours of Banksy’s work.Discover hidden librariesFrom repurposed old red phone boxes to shelves at the train station, hidden libraries are popping up everywhere. The literary scheme Read Now, Write Now has teamed up to create book exchange shelves along the Wirral train line, and Clapham North tube station in London has a book swap shelf located at its entrance. Over in Crossmichael in southern Scotland and Amberley in Stroud, locals have turned their old phone boxes into mini libraries. The pleasure in these new makeshift lending libraries? “You get to discover new gems,” says Fruzsina Bekefi who runs a monthly book swap out of east London reading nook Libreria. “It’s a great way to widen my horizons and inject a bit of serendipity into my life.”Find a new perspective There are more than 4m posts for #lookup on Instagram and with good reason: from intricate architecture to stunning skies, there’s so much you could miss if you keep your eyes trained on the ground. And as we shuffle along our daily tramlines, our thinking can get stuck in a rut too. Head up a hillside or tall building for a fresh look at where you live, or mix up your commute by getting off a stop or two early and walking the rest of the way.Discover hidden historyWhether you are a fan of poets, musicians, athletes or writers, it’s worth keeping your eyes peeled for the English Heritage blue plaque scheme. The plaques dotted around London point out where notable creatives lived in the city, from children’s author AA Milne to the black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The English heritage scheme has also influenced other local areas across the UK to celebrate their histories, too – so look out for blue plaques in Brighton and Hove, South Tyneside and Leeds (thanks to the local Leeds Civic Trust).Shake up your workoutIf your idea of exercise is headphones and a running machine, why not break the habit and explore a more sociable way to exercise? GoodGym hosts running meet-ups across the UK, combining fitness with an activity that benefits the local community. Jog to meet an isolated elderly person, sort out cans at a food bank or pitch in to tidy someone’s garden. A recent study from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in the US proved that team exercise can lower stress and improve quality of life.Appreciate moreBusy doesn’t have to equal stress – it’s all about how you approach it, says Griffith. “Do a routine activity mindfully, whether that is brushing your teeth or eating breakfast in the morning, by adjusting your senses to what you are doing,” she says. The benefits of mindfulness are worth it. “It’s a practise that lowers the stress hormone cortisol. It encourages those who apply mindfulness to their daily lives to have more compassion for themselves and others,” says Griffith.Get back to natureGwyneth Paltrow’s love of grounding has been well documented (and much maligned), but how about a spot of forest bathing? This new nature buzzword refers to a rising trend in green spaces inspired by a Japanese tradition. Try it by heading to your local forest or woodland trail and soaking up everything you see, touch, hear and smell. Even if you can’t make it that far afield, swap that “al desko” lunch for some much needed vitamin D – it’s the perfect pick-me-up when daylight hours are in such short supply.The Curiosity Rooms events take place at 55 Regent Street from 15 November to 16 December 2018.

We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

The former British international development minister has been condemned on both sides of the Irish Sea for her remarks in the Times that Britain could prevent the use of its country as a landbridge between Ireland and the continent. She responded to a British government report stating that a no-deal Brexit might mean food shortages in Ireland. In such a scenario she suggested this possibility could be used to exert pressure on the Irish Government to drop its insistence on the backstop. “This paper appears to show the government were well aware Ireland will face significant issues in a no-deal scenario. Why hasn’t this point been pressed home during negotiations,” she told the Times in reference to the report.Ms Patel’s only comments since that report was a tweet where she declined to elaborate other than to state: “It is clear my comments on‘No Deal’ (sic) have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels \u0026amp get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws \u0026amp money.” Many responses to her comments have referenced the Great Famine between 1845 and 1849. BBC journalist John Simpson tweeted: “If Priti Patel really did suggest that Britain should use the threat of food shortages to force Ireland to change its approach to Brexit, which I find hard to believe, then I’m more shocked than I can say. Have we learned nothing since the 1840s?”Labour MP David Lammy also referenced the Famine: “The starvation of innocent Irish men, women and children was one of the most shameful episodes in British colonial history. Priti Patel’s comments expose either extreme callousness or ignorance. Shame on her either way for throwing salt at old wounds.” Owen Smith, a former candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party, described her comments as inexcusable. “Ireland is our ally, friend and neighbour. To level this threat is as ignorant as it is reckless. I hope she reflects and retracts as soon as is possible. Her party leader should insist that she does.”Former BBC journalist Gavin Esler tweeted: “Truly despicable comments from Priti Patel – how is it possible that someone like this ended up in the British Cabinet?” Former SDLP leader Mark Durcan tweeted: “No, Priti, they weren’t taken out of context. What thought did you give to their content or context? Insulting people’s intelligence won’t redress or spin insults to identity \u0026amp interests. But thanks for exhibit proof of the need for backstop \u0026amp dangers with any parliamentary lock!” Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Ireland’s EU agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan and Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald have been among those in Ireland who have criticised the former Tory minister’s remarks.

Photograph: ReutersChina warned Canada on Saturday there would be severe consequences if it did not immediately release the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies.Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada on December 1st and faces extradition to the United States, which alleges she covered up her company’s links to a firm that tried to sell equipment to Iran despite sanctions.If extradited to the United States, Ms Meng, daughter of the founder of Huawei, would face charges of conspiracy to defraud multiple financial institutions, a Canadian court heard on Friday, with a maximum sentence of 30 years for each charge.No decision was reached at the extradition hearing after nearly six hours of arguments and counter-arguments, and the hearing was adjourned until Monday.In a short statement, China’s foreign ministry said that Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng had issued the warning to release Ms Meng to Canada’s ambassador in Beijing, summoning him to lodge a “strong protest”.Canada’s arrest of Ms Meng at the request of the United States while she was changing plane in Vancouver was a serious breach of her lawful rights, Mr Le said.The move “ignored the law, was unreasonable” and was in its very nature “extremely nasty”, he added.“China strongly urges the Canadian side to immediately release the detained person, and earnestly protect their lawful, legitimate rights, otherwise Canada must accept full responsibility for the serious consequences caused.”The statement did not elaborate.On Sunday, the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily said although China would not “cause trouble”, it also did not fear trouble and that nobody should underestimate China’s determination on this case.When asked about the possible Chinese backlash after the arrest Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday that Canada has a very good relationship with Beijing.Ms Meng’s arrest was on the same day that US president Donald Trump met in Argentina with China’s Xi Jinping to look for ways to resolve an escalating trade war between the world’s two largest economies.A Huawei spokesman said on Friday the company has “every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach the right conclusion.” The company has said it complies with all applicable export control and sanctions laws and other regulations. – Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

united by a love for the sea, rather than rowing - but have not let this put a check on their ambitions as they eye a finish within 40 days.Training for the 26-year-old was disrupted in September, when he tied the knot with Ms Thorp, his childhood sweetheart, at a lavish event in Oxfordshire.The \u0026#34Oar Inspiring\u0026#34 team believe they stand a chance of winning the 3,000-mile endurance challenge“The wife is not that pleased I’m not there for Christmas, but she’s quite supportive,” he told The Sunday .“There were a few weeks in September when my training wasn’t really going on, but a few sacrifices here and there but I got back on it.“(My family) understand we’re off on an adventure and they’re looking forward to following it - with a holiday in Antigua at the end.”On December 12, the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge will pitch 28 small rowing boats against each other in a race from San Sebastian in La Gomera, Canary Islands, to Nelson’s Dockyard in Antigua, the Caribbean.Only around 500 people have successfully rowed the Atlantic - one-tenth of the number that have summited Mount Everest.Fewer people have rowed across the Atlantic than have summited Mount EverestInspiration came to Lord Blandford two years ago - prior to his engagement - when he saw the race listed in a book of the world’s toughest endurance challenges.His ancestors are no strangers to adversity, with a family tree including wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Charles Spencer, who led the British expeditionary force on continental Europe during the Seven Years’ War in the 18th century.Lord Blandford said: “I think there is an element of adventure in the family and it’s nice to be able to do something a bit different.“I’m at an age where there aren’t many more opportunities like this that will come across, so when I had the idea to do it, I wanted to get on with it and do it.”The Marquess of Blandford is a keen polo player who has competed against the Duke of SussexAnd his team - also including Justin Evelegh and brothers Caspar and Toby Thorp, the Marchioness’s cousins - are hoping to achieve more than just a finish.“We’re going to try and win but we certainly want to be in the top 10 per cent,” Lord Blandford said.“Our motivation is the quicker we get there, the longer we have in Antigua.”They plan to row 24 hours a day, with half the team rowing for three hours at a time before swapping, scaled back to two hours at the oars as the race progresses.The future Duke of Marlborough and his team have trained for more than a yearExhaustion can reach such peaks during the challenge that previous competitors have reported hallucinations, while waves have been known to reach up to 20ft.Technology on board will give Lord Blandford and his crew a slender connection to the outside world - with calls to home planned on Christmas Day and New Year’s Eve.Once their boat finally docks, however, it will be time for the Marquess of Blandford to pick up marital responsibilities again with his new wife.  “We had a 10-day honeymoon, but I’ve promised her that we’ll do an extended stay in Antigua afterwards,” he said.Oar Inspiring are aiming to raise enough money to pay for a year’s worth of wishes for seriously ill children and can be sponsored at https:www.justgiving campaignscharity starlightchildrensfoundation oarinspiringPlease review our commenting policyComment: Maggie Thatcher versus the miners can inspire Britain’s last-minute no deal planningUrgent inspections of Steiner Schools ordered by Education Secretary in wake of  investigationHistoric castle excluded from protection measures at risk from repeated floodingPregnant women and children urged to come forward for flu jabs amid concern about low uptakeComment: I cannot support this Deal.

I don’t think they would be pleased to see the NHS affiliated with RT.“It (the logo) appeared more than three times an hour along with many other British companies.I think British shareholders and consumers should be aware that companies they invest in or use are paying to advertise through an organisation that acts as Putin’s mouthpiece.“When I informed the House of Commons my colleagues were horrified.”Pharmacy2U has since suspended the adverts after the firm was contacted by NHS England.The company insists a minimal amount was spent on the promotion. The company, along with other businesses found advertising on RT, said it was unaware the advert had been placed as it uses a computerised system to automatically bid on cheap advertisement slots.A Pharmacy2U spokesperson said: “Our adverts are aimed at people who we think might benefit from using Pharmacy2U, based on matching the demographic profile of our typical customer.As a result, they appear on multiple channels that reach these audiences in the UK.“As soon as we knew about the ad we removed it immediately.”Anna Belkina, Deputy Editor-in-ChiefHead of Communications at RT said: ”If a pharmacy serving the NHS makes a decision to restrict RT viewers from information and access to services based on undue political pressure, we should all question how that serves the interests of those in need in the British public.Other UK companies found to have recently advertised on RT include the British Heart Foundation, loan provider Lendable, bedding retailer Dormeo, insurance company Staysure, and Crocodile, a business selling garage doors.The British Heart Foundation and loan provider Lendable said they had no future plans to advertise on RT.Nick Georgiadis, of the British Heart Foundation, said: “We are aware that as part of a package of advertising bought through an external supplier representing multiple media outlets, a very small proportion of our advertising aired on RT but we don’t currently plan to advertise on RT in the future.A Lendable spokesperson said: ”We buy ads programmatically and in large volumes through ad exchange platforms and sales houses, so we don\u0027t always know in advance where our ads will end up.“That said, we will exclude Russia Today from all future marketing activity because we do not want to associate ourselves with the site.”The  approached the other companies for comment.Ofcom has previously upheld complaints lodged against RT for broadcasting misinformation. In 2015, the watchdog ruled that elements of an RT programme claiming the BBC had faked a chemical weapons attack in Syria were ”materially misleading.According to an Ofcom report from April 2018 RT draws an average audience of 3,400 viewers in Britain at any given point during the day.Bill Browder, a prominent critic of Vladimir Putin’s regime, said: “RT is Putin\u0027s main information war weapon against the West.Any Western company who gives RT money through advertising is effectively subsidising Putin\u0027s effort to subvert democracy and spread his criminal tentacles abroad. Those doing so should certainly be named and shamed, if not forbidden outright.Previously RT has voiced its disagreement with Ofcom\u0027s decision to investigate its news channel, describing itself as a “sacrificial political pawn” following accusations of broadcasting misinformation about the Skripal poisoning.  Comment: Maggie Thatcher versus the miners can inspire Britain’s last-minute no deal planningUrgent inspections of Steiner Schools ordered by Education Secretary in wake of  investigationHistoric castle excluded from protection measures at risk from repeated floodingPregnant women and children urged to come forward for flu jabs amid concern about low uptakeComment: I cannot support this Deal.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next.

Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.MacGowan went on to say that he does not want to get into an argument about the song and has no problem with it being censored during radio airplay.“If people don\u0027t understand that I was trying to accurately portray the character as authentically as possible then I am absolutely fine with them bleeping the word but I don\u0027t want to get into an argument,” he concluded.RTÉ yesterday confirmed that the song will continue to be played uncensored on RTE radio as it has for the past 30 years.Fairytale of New YorkShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 717 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.817 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. First Man is all about understated heroism. It’s affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Ryan Gosling) doesn’t feel the continual need to boast about his mission. The film is a tearjerker but a very subtle one. Dogman is one of the best Italian films of recent times, a modern day neo realist fable that bears comparison with the great work of Fellini, Rossellini, De Sica et al. Its main character, the dog groomer Marcello (Marcello Fonte), is a wonderful creation: loveable, vulnerable, seedy and comic all at the same time. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles.

Property prices in the three months from September to November fell 1.1 per cent compared with the preceding quarter, while prices dropped 1.4 per cent between October and November. Meanwhile, the rate of growth dropped to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate since December 2012. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “High employment, wage growth and historically low mortgage rates continue to make home ownership more affordable for many, though the need to raise a significant deposit still acts as something of a restraint on the market.

Mike Scott, chief property analyst at estate agent Yopa, said: “The usual Christmas slowdown in the housing market has started early this year, as people wait for the outcome of the current political turmoil before making long-term commitments, such as buying a new home.”Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former residential chairman of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said: “Looking forward, we don’t expect activity to change much, bearing in mind seasonal and political distractions. On the ground, lethargy is replacing energy.”Gary Barker, chief executive of proptech company Reapit, also predicted a continuation of the current subdued performance. “Transactions have been flat for the past three years, and caution is likely to remain whilst Brexit remains unfinished. Furthermore, if Brexit stalls, or more significant uncertainty over the government develops, it will be a painful road ahead,” he said. Mr Barker said that there could be room for optimism: “We are seeing house price reduction in some areas, which could make property more affordable and also boost the economy by increasing spending power and buying capacity. “If the Brexit deal passes through parliament, we could potentially see a much more confident market, resulting in more transactions, fewer withdrawals, and increased prices.”However, he added: “If the Bank of England’s forecast of a 30 per cent drop in house prices comes to fruition following a no-deal Brexit, the balance of the market will shift dramatically. “Although transactions may reduce significantly, with depressed prices discouraging sellers from listing their properties, low prices will put buyers back in control. First-time buyers, in particular, could benefit from slashed prices, giving them a leg-up onto the property ladder.”Additional reporting by newswiresShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Instagram doesn\u0027t offer the feature, however.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThankfully, you don\u0027t have to pick through all your pictures and find out the best ones: there\u0027s plenty of websites available to do that for you. The best one appears to be topnine.co, which includes some extra features like the ability to see how many likes you managed to get over the entire year.That site seems to be having problem in some countries, such as the UK – perhaps because of more stringent privacy rules – and so if you can\u0027t use that one you could head to the 2018bestnine site. It\u0027s not quite as neat, runs quite slowly and sticks a fairly ugly watermark on the bottom, but it includes some clever features, such as the ability to choose any date range that you like.Whichever one you use, just head to that site, give it your username, and it\u0027ll sort everything out from there. You can even give it someone else\u0027s username, should you want to see their best nine.Created with Sketch.11 useful Instagram features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Hide and reorder filtersFilters are a core part of Instagram, but there are so many available it can be easy to get lost.

Instagram unfortunately doesn’t let you tinker with filters and effects, but you can change your original caption, tag people and update the location.  The site finds out which of your posts received the most likes, assembling them into a collage of nine pictures. You can then opt to share it to your Instagram – or do whatever else you like, such as sending it directly to your friends or uploading it to your story.Instagram finally lets people choose who sees storiesThe feature might take a while to compile your picture and so asks for an email address so that it can notify you of when your best nine is ready. While its privacy policy allows it to use that email for marketing, it does allow you to opt out – but if you\u0027re anxious about it, it might be worth quickly setting up a disposable email account just to make sure your address stays safe.That website – unlike some other, more questionable tools – doesn\u0027t require that you give it your login or the ability to access your account, since all the data that it needs to make the collage is public anyway. Since there are safe tools like that around, make sure not to use one that requires you to give any account information at all, since it is unnecessary and can put you at risk of having your profile used maliciously or even hacked.But for the same reason, the tool will only work for public profiles. Since it works by scraping the information from your profile, if you\u0027ve locked it down you won\u0027t be able to see the results.One option is simply to switch very quickly to a public profile, make your collage, and then switch back. As long as you do it quickly then it is unlikely anyone will notice.Another option is to make your own best nine, by picking through your photos and then arranging them into a collage using Instagram\u0027s own Layout app. That has the advantage of allowing you to choose any photos you wish you were included but aren\u0027t – but the downside of having to pick manually through what might be hundreds of photos.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. 140 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO240 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film.

And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HO740 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO940 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1540 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2740 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2840 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2940 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3340 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3440 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery.

Hart had previously made a series of jokes that were deemed homophobic, including Tweets posted between 2009-11 which have since been deleted. One read: “Yo if my son comes home \u0026amp\u0026nbsp try’s \u0026nbsp2 play with my\u0026nbsp daughters \u0026nbspdoll house I’m going 2 break \u0026nbspit over his head \u0026amp say n my voice ‘stop that’s gay’.”During a stand-up show, he said: “One of my biggest fears is my son growing up and being gay,” he said. ”That’s a fear. Keep in mind, I’m not homophobic, I have nothing against gay people, be happy. Do what you want to do. But me, being a heterosexual male, if I can prevent my son from being gay, I will. Now with that being said, I don’t know if I handled my son’s first gay moment correctly. Every kid has a gay moment but when it happens, you’ve got to nip it in the bud!”It’s a shame Kevin Hart furore will ert attention away from MeTooIn 2015, Hart revealed that he turned down a role in 2008’s\u0026nbspTropic Thunder\u0026nbspbecause the character was gay and his behaviour was “real flagrant”, before adding that he’d never be able to play a gay character in the future.In an Instagram post before stepping down as Oscars host, Hart spoke out against the “negative energy” of the criticism towards the comments, asking people to “stop searching for reasons to be angry”. He said he was almost 40 years old and was “in love with the man I’m becoming”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Back then in 2000, she wasn’t yet one of the great icons of popular culture. All I knew about her was the publicity cliché of her being a single mother made good. It was the same tired story repeated constantly about her.\u0026nbspSo I ignored all that and started her journey at the beginning in the villages near Bristol where she grew up.I discovered she was childhood friends with the Potter family who had lived in the same street and I spoke to them about childhood dressing-up games and Jo Rowling’s vivid imagination. I remember Mrs Potter telling me that Jo always had a big aversion to spiders. It’s no surprise that spiders the size of carthorses feature in her books.Six male celebrities changing the conversation around masculinityIt’s a bit like playing detective but you’re not investigating a crime. Start at the beginning and follow the journey imagine you are celebrating a life and chat to those who have known, liked or loved the famous person you are writing about.I moved on to Oporto in Portugal where Jo taught English as a foreign language to local students. I met her best Portuguese friend who worked with her at the school. She invited me to a family party at a restaurant where all these delicious dishes kept on appearing throughout the night the children ran around playing games and we drank wine and talked. It was a perfect evening. She told me the story of how she helped Jo extricate herself from her unhappy first marriage to a local man and return hastily to the UK with her young daughter. She also told me at the time she thought Jo was a nervous person, anxious and flitting around like a butterfly.Rowling\u0026nbspto Oporto in Portugal, where she was married to a local man and teaching English as a foreign language (AFPGetty)Through the eyes of the people I spoke to, I was able to build a picture of a real person – not one created by a publicity department. People like to talk if given the chance. I realised that when I was responsible for reporting golden and diamond wedding anniversaries on a weekly newspaper. That may sound boring but I loved it – the chance to hear about people’s lives while having a cup of tea and piece of homemade fruit cake. But you can’t pretend to be interested. That’s impossible to fake. My philosophy is simple: the most disrespectful thing you can do to another person is to have no interest in them.\u0026nbspWe live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing. In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen.The lesson I learned very early on in my career is that everyone deserves your time and attention. We live in an online world where the art of proper conversation is disappearing. In my job, if you turn off the phone and laptop and talk to people, things happen. If you follow the footsteps of your subject, you make connections. You get insight and you get lucky.I stopped off to buy a sandwich and a beer at the grocery store in Laurel Canyon, the Bohemian area of Los Angeles where Jennifer Aniston used to live when she was a struggling actress. I asked the guy on the till if he had ever come across her. ‘She used to work here,’ he said and proceeded to tell me all about it. He made me laugh because he wasn’t so impressed with Jennifer, who, after all, was still a shop assistant in his eyes. But his eyes lit up when he told me that Sophia Loren had once been in his store.I met with Jennifer’s school drama teacher Anthony Abeson in New York and went along to one of his classes. He had great enthusiasm for Jennifer as an actress. He told me about the time at the Fame School where his pupils had to prepare a scene for performance in front of class and she chose a particularly difficult one from The Three Sisters by Chekhov. It was meant to be very dramatic but everyone laughed. She was mortified. Afterwards, Anthony took her aside and told her she had a wonderful gift and it was marvellous that she had this ability to amuse. His words were life changing for her.\u0026nbspI was in McComb, Mississippi, which is where Britney Spears went to school. I was given an address for her first boyfriend about 10\u0026nbspmiles out of town so I drove out but there was no one there. There were no other houses. Nothing –\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspdead end. As I was leaving, a car pulled up. It was his mother, who was a charming woman. She\u0026nbspinvited me into her amazing mansion for coffee. She was a very accomplished painter and showed me her work. She rang up her son and he agreed to speak to me.He was great company and took me to a barbecue in the Mississippi woods. We chatted and drank beer and threw golf balls into the woods for his dog to fetch. He told me he once took Britney turkey hunting but she had to give up when she was bitten to hell by mosquitoes. This is a long way from Las Vegas and when night falls you can hear the coyotes – it’s a scary place. Britney didn’t like the nights in the woods and would get upset and have to be taken home. I don’t blame her.One of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationismOne of the myths about Britney is that she is some sort of trailer trash from the Deep South. This is nonsense. She went to a private school, where, incidentally, she was taught creationism. She had private dancing lessons. Her teenage boyfriend’s house had an elevator between floors. Money was tight when her dad’s building firm collapsed but she was brought up as a nice little girl. I remember speaking to her teacher at the Disney School in Orlando, Florida, when she was under contract to Disney. He told me that she was ‘the most wholesome, huggable little girl that you would ever want to see’. This is the real Britney Spears.\u0026nbspBritney used to date Justin Timberlake, who I also wrote about. I flew into Memphis, where I thought he was from, only to discover he was actually brought up 20\u0026nbspmiles away in the comfortable middle-class community of Shelby Forest, on the outskirts of the town of Millington.\u0026nbspOn my first day there I went into the local Millington library and asked loudly, ‘Does anyone here know Justin Timberlake?’ A woman piped up:\u0026nbsp‘My daughter was in his class at school.’ She put me in touch with her daughter and we had a lovely lunch and she told me about growing up in Shelby Forest.Apparently Justin was a Maths geek at school and was in the algebra club. She also recalled the school’s Christmas concert when the power failed. The enormous school gym was packed with bewildered parents and children sitting in complete darkness. Suddenly a voice launched forth from the gloom. It was Justin, aged 11, singing ‘O Holy Night’, unaccompanied. My lunch companion remembered, ‘The whole gym was in tears.’The most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he\u0026nbspwasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. \u0026nbspHe\u0026nbsppreferred to take part in\u0026nbsppanto\u0026nbspthan kick a ball around in the parkI also had lunch with Justin’s delightful first girlfriend, who was looking forward to her wedding to a local doctor. She told me about the time she and Justin had decided to make love for the first time. They needed to buy condoms but that was tricky because Justin’s stepmum was the local pharmacist. In the end they had to catch the bus into Memphis to purchase a pack of three. Danielle’s pet name for Justin was ‘Stud Muffin’, a dream nickname for any teenage boy.\u0026nbspI love being able to share interesting new things about people we admire and care about. Take Robbie Williams for example. I had a great time in Stoke on Trent drinking with his old school buddies. They called him Rob – he wasn’t Robbie until Take That’s manager decided to call him that for his image. Rob and his friends were rascals. They used to ring up random numbers and tell jokes on the answer machine until the tape ran out.\u0026nbspThe most interesting thing about Rob, however, was learning that he wasn’t entirely Jack the Lad. He was a\u0026nbsprather a sensitive boy and a highly talented one who preferred to take part in panto than kick a ball around in the park. His father, a professional comedian, left home when he was a youngster and it had a profound effect on him.Why some people don\u0027t celebrate ThanksgivingAutistic boy writes letter to Anne Hegerty calling her an inspirationYoung people more inspired by grandparents than celebrities, pollI learnt much of his true nature from a wonderful woman called Zoe who was his closest friend in amateur dramatics for 10\u0026nbspyears. They were inseparable. They were in Chittty Chitty Bang Bang, Annie, Pickwick and Oliver together. In Oliver he was the Artful Dodger. On the opening night, Zoe knew something was wrong. He was singing ‘Consider Yourself’ and he just wasn’t himself. Off stage she could see he was upset, so put her arm around him and asked him what was wrong. He told her:\u0026nbsp‘I just started my first lines and I look up and there is my effing old man in the front row.’ He started crying but he went back out and gave the performance of his young life for his Dad.\u0026nbspI really warmed to Robbie. \u0026nbspI don’t write about celebrities. It’s a meaningless word these days, isn’t it? Celebrity used to mean something when we idolised proper stars such as\u0026nbspMarilyn Monroe, Audrey Hepburn or Elvis.\u0026nbsp Now, everybody is a celebrity who has been on television for two seconds. I write about the most famous people in the world: Adele, Cheryl, Kate Middleton and my latest subject, Ed Sheeran.But, more than that, I write about real people. When I was looking at the amazing life of Adele, I went into the flower shop in South London where she used to buy flowers for her mum and the young assistant in there said to me:\u0026nbsp‘I love Adele. She keeps it real.’\u0026nbspGeorge Michael, who I wrote about following his very sad death, is an example of someone who the world\u0026nbspdidn’t really know during his lifetime. He was poorly treated by the media while he was alive. He turned out to be a thoroughly decent man, a good man. But he\u0026nbspwasn’t George Michael until he was 18. He was\u0026nbspGeorgios Panayiotou, a Greek Cypriot boy.I interviewed his girlfriends from school and they were so warm about him. It was a joy. first girlfriend told me the story of how at her 16th birthday party, Yog, as she called him, turned up at her parents’ house with Andy – Andrew Ridgeley. It was a great night and later in the evening she looked out of the window into the garden to see the two future superstars of Wham! peeing into the fishpond.Ed Sheeran by Sean Smith is published by HarperCollins and is out now.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightThe issue appears to have been with a piece of software, provided by Ericsson, which is relied on not just by O2 but by other companies that experienced problems, such as Japan’s Softbank.Börje Ekholm, president and chief executive of Ericsson, said: “The faulty software that has caused these issues is being decommissioned and we apologise not only to our customers but also to their customers. We work hard to ensure that our customers can limit the impact and restore their services as soon as possible.”Ericsson says O2 data will be coming back ‘as soon as possible’The company said most of its affected customers had got back online, but that some – presumably including Tesco – were still not working, and that it was continuing to work with them.On Thursday evening, O2’s\u0026nbspchief executive said\u0026nbsphe was “sorry because we have let our customers down”.\u0026nbspMark Evans told Sky News restoration of the network had started and it would be completed by Friday morning.\u0026nbspPressed\u0026nbspby Sky News host\u0026nbspDermot Murnaghan\u0026nbspif the company would compensate customers, Mr Evans would only say it would “find a way of making an apology in an O2 way”.\u0026nbspMr Evans admitted, however,\u0026nbsphe did “not know yet” what “an O2 way” meant.The problems with the service provide\u0026nbsphave hit as many as 30 million people in the UK, affecting not only O2 customers but users of the networks that borrow their infrastructure, such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff.It also hit transport networks and other systems that rely on O2’s\u0026nbspinternet connections to transfer data.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It still appears to be affecting every customer\u0026nbspof O2.As well as the network\u0027s own users, customers of other carriers that rely on O2 – such as Tesco\u0026nbspMobile and GiffGaff\u0026nbsp– are also unable to get online.O2 said the problem was affecting only internet\u0026nbspconnections, and some texts. But many customers said they have no signal at all, and calls are not getting through either.The problems have also hit systems that seem entirely unrelated, such as live updating bus arrivals boards, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata network to report where they are.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

They will be informed about when that is available.O2 data network restored after millions hit by day-long outageAnd pay as you go customers on O2\u0027s mobile broadband will also be given a 10 per cent discount on a Bolt On purchase in the new year.All of O2\u0027s\u0026nbsp30 million customers are thought to have been hit by the outage, and so will be receiving the free package.Customers do not appear to need to do anything to get the refund, and will either be contacted to alert them to it or will just receive the additional airtime added to their bill.It is not clear whether customers of the networks that were also offline because they rely on O2\u0027s infrastructure – such as GiffGaff\u0026nbspand Tesco\u0026nbspMobile – will also be getting refunds from their carriers.The outage caused problems across the UK, including in some unusual places, such as live bus arrivals at bus stops, which rely on O2\u0027s\u0026nbspdata connection.It lasted for almost a full day, going down early in the morning and with service only being restored overnight the following evening.O2 said the issues were caused by problems with software provided by Ericsson. It also caused problems elsewhere in the world, such as at Japan\u0027s Softbank.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The oil producing nations had been expected to agree to a reduction in production on Thursday at its meeting in Vienna. Reaching a deal proved difficult as sanctions-hit Iran refused to comply with the output cuts, despite the input of non-Opec member Russia. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe stalemate led the oil price to fall - the commodity had previously dropped by 30 per cent from four-year highs of more than $86 per barrel in October to below $59 at the end of November. However, a second day of talks led to an agreement, providing a boost to the price of Brent crude which rose to $63.25 by mid-afternoon on Friday. Qatar to quit Opec in 2019 amid angry dispute with Saudi ArabiaWhat is OPEC and why has Qatar left its ranks?Trump hits out at OPEC and says oil prices are artificially very highWhy Opec is caught between a rock and a hard placeBarani Krishnan, senior analyst at Investing, said it was natural that oil traders would react as positively to Opec’s decision to cut production as they did negatively “when the group seemed powerless to reduce even a barrel”. He added: “However, the market will also be watching for any signs of cheating by OPEC and punish the cartel accordingly.”Mr Krishnan said the bigger takeaway is “what the Saudi energy minister would possibly have on his mind as he leaves Vienna today a Russia that has become as powerful to Opec as Riyadh and a US that is now a net exporter of oil”.Furthermore, we\u0027ve not even gotten to the Khashoggi fallout and likely Trump dismay over these cuts,” he added. “One can only speculate at this point to how this will play out for the Saudis and their oil business going forward.Donald Trump had called on Opec to leave production unfettered in order to weigh prices down, tweeting ahead of the Vienna meeting: “The world does not want to see… higher oil prices”. Meanwhile, Ashley Kelty, oil \u0026amp gas research analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said that although cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day was a larger reduction than some had expected, it was still short of “what is really required to bring the market back into balance”. She said: “Our initial snap judgement is that prices will stabilise in the $60-65 per barrel range, as the cuts are likely to be insufficient to stem the near term supply glut, given US output is continuing to \u0026nbsprise (albeit at a slower pace due to capacity constraints).“It feels like a bit of a fudge, and the absence of the final communique at this late stage suggests that a lot of horse trading has been underway to reach a situation that tries to appeal to all parties, whilst ending up with a situation that will appease no-one.”Earlier this week, Qatar quit Opec, however, it still attended the meeting in Vienna.

Tory MPs don’t like it because we can’t get out of it except by signing a permanent trade deal that guarantees the same thing. Even Jeremy Corbyn has criticised it because we have no way out of it except with the agreement of the EU.\u0026nbspNow she could tell her MPs that avoiding a hard border in Ireland is something to which the UK should be committed anyway. But a lot of them don’t agree. They think it would be a price worth paying for a “real” Brexit – although they tend to argue in public that a hard border could be managed by technology so no one would notice it.\u0026nbspSo, instead, Theresa May is telling her rebels that they can have a veto over the backstop, should it ever be needed.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’This is spin. She has written into the withdrawal agreement a choice at the end of the transition period, the end of 2020. If the long-term trade deal with the EU has not been negotiated by then, and it seems likely that it would not have been, the UK would then face a choice between the backstop or a one-off extension to the transition period. It would be inconceivable that any government would make that decision without consulting parliament, so May’s “offer” is no more than a statement of the obvious.\u0026nbspAnd it does not get round the fact that the backstop will still be the fallback option. If, in 2020, the UK opts to extend the transition period, at most by two years to the end of 2022, and if when that expires there is still no long-term trade deal, then the backstop will come into effect anyway.\u0026nbspThe only way out of it would be for the UK to repudiate the withdrawal agreement. This is an international treaty and we have a sovereign right as a nation to pull out of any treaty, but that would have serious consequences. Any country that goes around binning international agreements would become, in effect, a rogue state, and other countries will be wary of signing new deals with it. If we did that, it would not be possible to negotiate any kind of trade deal with the EU.\u0026nbspThis was what many journalists and Brussels officials thought the prime minister meant by her offer: she would be giving MPs the chance to repudiate an agreement to which they had just agreed. That is the trouble with spin. If you are trying to pretend something is what it is not, people might assume you mean something else altogether.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread. Plenty more happened that would have been big news on any other day.\u0026nbspNigel Farage also announced he was leaving Ukip – the party he has long been synonymous with – because of its increasing closeness to far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\u0026nbspThe BBC dropped out of plans to host a debate on Brexit between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May after the three sides couldn’t agree on a format.The Pound fell to an 18-month low after the Government lost the contempt vote, but then rebounded.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King wrote an article in which he likened Theresa May’s Brexit deal to the appeasement of the Nazis. All in a day’s work!\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Salary and expense data posted in spreadsheets on the website of Albania’s Ministry of Finance show a wealth of details about the State Intelligence Service, including the locations of field offices, cash withdrawals, and minutiae such as the plumbers, technicians and mechanics they use. The records show the names and national identification card numbers of agents in the service, known locally and in the intelligence community as SHISH, operating inside Albania and abroad, including two with sensitive posts at Nato headquarters in Brussels.\u0026nbspThe spreadsheets disclose the names, positions, salaries and expenses of at least eight senior clandestine Albanian operatives – some working under diplomatic cover – in Belgium, Greece, Kosovo, Italy, Macedonia and Serbia.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Independent is not disclosing names or other identifying details to prevent retribution against low-level informants or others who may be associated with the agency’s operatives. Presented with the breach during a meeting in a café outside the agency’s heavily fortified Tirana compound, SHISH officials acknowledged the sensitive nature of the information.“The principle is that everything our agency does should be hidden, but we should follow all these rules and regulations,” said one SHISH official. “The rules and regulations don’t allow us to spend the money without reporting it.”Intelligence and security professionals told about the breach were stunned by the revelations, which could leave agents in sensitive positions vulnerable to surveillance or blackmail by hostile intelligence organisations or criminals seeking to infiltrate the Western alliance. “By getting into Albania’s system they can get into Nato’s system,” said Xhemal Gjunkshi, an opposition member of the Albanian parliament who serves on the National Security Commission and was a former Major-General in the army.\u0026nbsp“You start pulling a string and you end up in Brussels or London or the office of a supreme allied commander in the US.”Helidon Bendo, director of Albania’s State Intelligence Service, or SHISH\u0026nbsp(SHISH)A former CIA field operative familiar with SHISH described it as the type of bureaucratic catastrophe that could put lives at risk. “Your admin can screw you up if they’re not paying attention,” he told The Independent on condition of anonymity because he continues to work on sensitive security matters. “You can put the budget online. But to put the names and the other details of agents – that’s insanity.”A Brussels-based spokesperson for Nato said in an email that it does not comment on intelligence matters.Sigurimi, Albania’s Communist-era domestic spy service, at The House of Lives, a former intelligence headquarters now a museum in Tirana\u0026nbsp(Borzou Daragahi)SHISH is the successor organisation to the much feared Sigurimi, the notorious Communist-era domestic spy service that infiltrated every aspect of Albanians’ personal lives during the country’s four-and-a-half decade Stalinesque dictatorship. A 2007 US State Department cable published by Wikileaks described SHISH as “a professional, largely apolitical intelligence service” that is “excellent partners” with the US government and cited “close cooperation on all intelligence activities”.The director of the organisation, currently Helidon Bendo, is appointed by the prime minister but it operates as an autonomous unit outside of the Albanian cabinet. According to the finance ministry documents, it employs 913 people. One foreign diplomat complained that SHISH operates with little accountability or oversight. The documents revealed tantalising clues about the operations of the clandestine agency. The Independent could not confirm whether the names of the operatives inside Albania were handles or birth names. But the names of the international operatives listed matched the identities of Albanian diplomatic staff posted at embassies across Europe.One female regional operative in the main port city of Durrës, whose name and ID card number are visible in the records, is listed as withdrawing the Albanian currency equivalent\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp£18,000, over at least 10 transactions this year for “special payments”, a possible reference to networks of informants.Another agent in Gjirokastër, in Albania’s south, is recorded withdrawing a cheque for about £1,500 in November for what is described on the Albanian ministry of finance’s public website as a “secret fund”. One set of 2017 payments, classified as secret, refers to a Nato communications system, referred to as Tumba, which might refer to several mountain peaks in the Balkans.At one point, water bills in Albania’s Himara district, where many members of the country’s Greek minority reside, suddenly drop 95 per cent, suggesting shifting surveillance priorities. The information appeared to be updated daily. A withdrawal of about £21,000\u0026nbspfrom Credins Bank in Tirana on 3 December was posted online by day’s end. Details include the licence plate numbers and sometimes make and model details of vehicles used by the spies, and even where the cars are taken for repairs, as well as records of pricey hotel stays and restaurant bills.Officials vowed to remove the data after The Independent informed the country’s prime ministry, intelligence services, foreign ministry, interior ministry, defence ministry and finance ministry publication of this article was pending. During the months the information has been online, it likely left the Nato country vulnerable to infiltration by operatives of Russian or other intelligence agencies. The country has already become something of a battleground as dominant pro-Western political leaders fend off the Kremlin’s agenda of weakening its Nato and EU ties. In March, Albania expelled two Russian diplomats, accusing them of unauthorised intelligence operations. “Their work did not correspond to their diplomatic status,” the foreign minister Ditmir Bushati said at the time.Albania appears to have repeatedly suffered from a lack of information security when it comes to its intelligence services. Last year the presidency\u0026nbspposted online an unredacted copy of SHISH director Mr Bendo’s national identification card, which includes his home address and ID number, as part of a transparency initiative.Earlier this year, a state agency reportedly was sent a list of 250 or so names of operatives serving in the country’s Military Intelligence unit. The SHISH documents posted online date back to 2014, as Albania struggled to show the EU that it had shaken off its history of public corruption and was seeking to be more transparent and accountable as a step towards membership in the trading and currency bloc.Albanian laws forbids the leaking of secret state information, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison for officials who ulge the intelligence and five years for ordinary citizens. Told of the leaks, officials of the prime minister’s office, finance ministry, interior ministry, and foreign ministry scrambled behind the scenes to remove the data, but also assign blame for the mishap. “The treasury registers on its online system all the bills and order of payments that are executed each day,” one official said on condition of anonymity. “All the details that are given there, are because they were written in the order of payment by the institution itself. They should have not detailed the bills with such sensitive information.”One longtime former officer of the Albanian intelligence service told The Independent that the culpability lay with SHISH itself, for handing sensitive information to finance ministry officials who lack security clearances.“It’s incompetence of the leadership,” said the former official, who spoke on condition he not be named discussing sensitive political issues. “Sometimes people are hired not because of good performance or qualifications, but because of the influence of the politicians. Sometimes people coming into the security institutions aren’t well vetted. The problem starts at the top.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Suddenly, every berk thinks that the phone in their hand gives them the right to publish anything they see.Either they have some gung-ho fantasy of being a war correspondent, responsible for recording a fracas without doing a damn thing about stopping it. Or  in their head they are suddenly Quentin ­Tarantino, recording a particularly tasty bit of violence.So we get incidents like last week’s, at a Towie-favourite nightclub in Gants Hill, North East ­London. A young woman was filmed being sexually assaulted as onlookers, some of them women, jeer at the “fun” and point cameras up her skirt.Were these people scared of intervening and pulling the thugs off her, and filming it in order to pass the footage on to club management and police  Nope, they just put it up on the internet for the world to share the jeering. The weird and wicked idea that this is somehow OK is growing.Incidents on planes, in clubs, in the street, in schoolyards, are filmed by bystanders who don’t even try to shout or intervene. They are then plonked online, just to get some strange kudos for the person filming it.From the US and, increasingly, here there are cases of onlookers recording the humiliation of other people, not responsibly and ethically in order to give it to the authorities — managements, police, teachers — but just to put it online and “go viral”.Take the coward who last month filmed a policewoman being violently kicked in the head, then posted the footage online with the caption “LOL.” Or the bully who posted a video of a drunk teen ­giving oral sex to more than  men in Magaluf, for the “banter”.And last week, a shocking video of a -year-old Syrian refugee boy called Jamal being dragged to the floor by his neck went viral. Then, because the poor boy has not been humiliated enough, his ordeal was shared online by “disgusted” celebs and MPs who proclaim to care but are, of course, unwittingly ­contributing to his suffering.Some may vaguely think they are activists exposing bad ­behaviour, but in cases like this they are no such thing. They are voyeurs, cowards, and exhibitionists. Because it’s the victim of the attack, not just the attackers, who gets humiliated.Anyone half-decent understands that only disgusting ­people go in for “revenge porn”, sharing intimate videos of someone they broke up with. Whether dumped or cheated on, that is a horrible thing to do and can make the victim suicidal. Young girls live in terror of it, on one hand encouraged to be sexy and on the other scared of having their most unguarded moments exposed to the world.It has, a few times, led to ­prosecution and so it should. But personal vengeance and associated “slut-shaming” is only part of it.The whole business of filming other people without consent needs to be seen for what it is — a form of unregulated, potentially irresponsible and damaging rogue journalism.  Smartphone tech and the internet should be ­governed by the same ethical rules journalism developed.Good editors pixelate faces and agonise about what is responsible reporting, and what is in the ­public interest.If it would be wrong for a news reporter to film, for no good ­reason, a person being humiliated, assaulted, or even just tumbling in the street or falling asleep in an embarrassing position on a train, then it is even more wrong for any selfish git with a smartphone to do it.Journalism has rules because it is public. Now that technology can make anyone’s instant shot just as public, the rules should be the same. And because the technology belongs to the “digital natives” who grew up with it, it is time they applied to it all those pious, ethical modern values which we hear so much about.Not all slut-shamers and gloating video bystanders are young — but a great many are. It’s the job of the new ­generation to invent and support a digital morality.What’s the point being a ­liberated, gay-friendly, vegan-conscious, no-ing snowflakeyou’re not willing to call out callous voyeurs and smartphone sneaks Libby Purves is a former presenter of Radio ’s Today programme.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this lot beats them all.Two years ago we had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in the European Union. The outcome was decisive.By  per cent to  per cent we voted to leave. The people had been given a voice.And the people said very clearly: We want to leave.But there was never a majority among our political class for leaving.tp composite more brexitBecause for two years the Remainer majority of MPs has done everything it possibly can to thwart the will of the people.They have undermined Theresa May and the Government when it tried to negotiate with Brussels.That’s the main reason the deal we have before us now is so weak.Because as soon as ministers set off to do battle, the likes of Philip Hammond and Justine Greening would be trying to pull the rug from under their feet.The biggest deceit is this. All the while these politicians are trying to scupper Brexit, they are putting on their sincere faces and saying: “We must respect the will of the people.”This is a downright lie and it has always been a downright lie.When Tory Remainers tell you we must get a good deal, they really mean we must not leave the European Union.When the Labour Party tells you that we must have a “good Brexit for jobs”, they really mean that we must not leave the European Union.When that coffin-faced bore Dominic Grieve, once our Attorney General, puts down amendments which effectively stop us leaving with a no-deal, he is really saying: “We must not leave the European Union under any conditions at all.”When they start lecturing you about how Parliament must be sovereign — they’re saying the same thing. We must not leave the EU.What has happened over the past two years has been a concerted campaign of treachery and betrayal.The Tory Brexiteers — with one or two exceptions, such as David Davis, Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg — haven’t helped by being a disorganised rabble.Too interested in their own political careers to do the dficult work of leading Britain towards a confident exit from that authoritarian bureaucracy.But it is the Remainers who have done the real damage.If they didn’t tell us, at every step of the way, that “the people’s vote must be respected” then I’d have a little more time for them. But they trot that out every time they open their mouths.All the while trying to wreck any chance of Brexit.God knows what will happen now. Although I suspect even he’s perplexed.What should have been a graceful and confident exit from an unfit institution has turned into a bugger’s muddle.But I do know this. The people of the UK will not forget the names of those who have sold us down the river.And one day, sure enough, we’ll have our revenge.What’s advertised as a glistening winter wonderland is usually five square yards of mud with a plastic donkey and an elf who has just completed a five stretch for armed robbery.I know everybody needs to make a ­living. But I do wonder how the owners of these crap grottos live with themselves.Find eight of the best Winter Wonderlands here.WHAT a fabulous family the Osamors are.A real credit to the country, to the Labour Party and to the House of Commons.Let’s start with Kate, above, the Labour MP for Edmonton and one of Jeremy ­Corbyn’s favourites.She employed her son, Ishmael, below, as a researcher at the House of Commons.And continued to do so even after he had been convicted of possessing lethal drugs including ketamine and ecstasy at a festival.Not only that, but she misled the public and her colleagues.She said she hadn’t known about her son’s conviction until after he was sentenced.When it was absolutely clear that she had.How did she respond when a journalist tried to ask her about this business She screamed “f*** off” at him. Then threw a bucket of water at him.Then said: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your head in.”After which, this entitled madam actually rang  – twice – to say the reporter was “stalking” her.Unbelievable.Then there’s  Grandma Osamor, Kate’s mother Martha. Now ennobled as Baroness Osamor of Tottenham and taking her seat in the House of Lords at your expense.A supporter of Labour activists suspended over anti-Semitism.And once considered too left-wing even for the Labour Party, until Corbyn came along.What a great parenting job both she and her daughter have done.And do you suppose that either would be in the ­positions they are now were it not for the colour of their skin THE animal rights activists Peta want us to stop using  certain phrases which are nasty about animals.Such as, “No use flogging a dead horse”.Better to say: “You can’t feed a fed horse.” Which doesn’t sound right at all, to me.Some vegans are also supposedly  objecting to “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”, because it’s unkind to eggs. And “bringing home the bacon”. Which is unkind to bacon.I think we need to create a few new ones to annoy Peta even further. So . . .Too many voles in the blender spoil the smoothie.Riots, confusion, mayhem. They’ve just woken up to the fact that their president is a smirking liberal halfwit who cares not a jot about working-class people.  We could have told you that, mes amis, when you elected him  months ago.Emmanuel Macron has already had to climb down and give in to some of the demands from the rioters.During the election he portrayed himself as a populist, but was anything but. It was a con job.Next time you toddle off to the polls, you lot, get it right.SO, Nigel Farage has deserted Ukip because he thinks the party has become too extremist.Fair enough, he’s probably right. The party looks dead and buried.It’s a shame that because of our first-past-the-post system Ukip were never able to capture many seats in parliament.I’ve never been a fan of proportional representation.Butwe had it, Ukip under Farage, above, would likely be our second or third biggest party by now.And those negotiations over  Brexit would be looking very dferent, wouldn’t they RESPECT to Wrexham driver Kenneth Samuels. He managed to fit ELEVEN people into his Ford Focus.Actually, he’s a Wrexham non-driver now, because the Old Bill caught him.  He was disqualied from driving for  months.I assumed at first that he was ferrying a troupe of dwarves to a panto.But no. There were children involved, which kind of antagonised the magistrates.If the police had looked a bit further I suspect they’d have found the entire Liberal Democrat Party in the boot.  And Speaker John Bercow in the glove box. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Senior figures there say that will not be decided until Monday.But they do admit they are making little headway in trying to quell this rebellion, and that they are heading for a loss.How big  “I’m sure it’ll breach three figures”, one Cabinet minister says of the margin of defeat.A way to avoid such a humiliation would be to find an amendment that could pass the Commons.This means there would be no vote on May’s deal as it currently stands, enabling the Government to argue that it hadn’t actually been defeated.Though, as one source admits, voters would be left baffled by this procedural trick.This approach isn’t guaranteed to work either.First of all, it would rely on John Bercow selecting the amendment — which is far from certain. The Speaker is supposed to be impartial, but Bercow has long used his power to cause the Government trouble.Much of Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting was taken up with ministers complaining about him. Liam Fox, the Trade ­Secretary, called Bercow “a disgrace to his office”.Also, some Tory rebels are itching to defeat the Government. They are discussing whether to vote against ALL amendments, regardless of whether they agree with them or not, so they can make clear their opposition to May’s deal. Some in Cabinet think thatMPs voted for an amendment setting out what would make the deal acceptable to Parliament, it would strengthen May’s hand with the EU.One tells me: “The negotiation has been all about us saying yes or no. This would make the EU say yes or no to something.”Chancellor Philip Hammond, though, argued at Thursday’s inner Cabinet that any concessions are more likely to come after a vote has been lost — so there was a case for pressing on.What May thinks the way ahead is remains unclear even to her inner Cabinet, much to their frustration.“The main problem is that it is very dficult to read the PM,” one tells me, adding that, “Until she decides what she wants to do, it is very dficult to put weight behind any ­particular outcome.”Backbench Tory MPs are also becoming increasingly irritated with her.One senior figure who is ­normally sympathetic complains that she has become “completely messianic about the backstop”. This source says that Tory MPs “want to hear a solution rather than this is the only choice and they’re stupid”.Allies of May are deeply pessimistic about the EU offering any meaningful concessions.Their view is that the EU thinks that the alternatives to May’s deal are either a softer Brexit or a second referendum, so it has little incentive to offer much up.Not everyone in the Cabinet is so sure.One senior minister, with Prime Ministerial ambitions, has been explaining to junior ministers in detail how they could negotiate a better deal on the backstop.Tory leadership contenders are readying themselves.They calculate thatthe vote goes ahead this week May will lose by a big margin, the  letters will then go in and May could well lose that vote of confidence, triggering a contest.If she does go ahead with Tuesday’s vote, she’ll be betting her premiership on keeping the margin of defeat respectable. It would be a mighty gamble.There are two reasons for this. First, the Labour front bench are not keen on Norway-Plus and a number of those on the Labour benches who did support it have moved to backing a second ­referendum. Second, there is now more Tory opposition to it than there was before, particularly among the Cabinet.One Secretary of State warns that a Norway Plus deal “would destroy the Conservative Party forever”.The problem is that in an effort to make the plan acceptable to the Europeans, it has gone from being a temporary solution that would give the UK time to negotiate a free trade deal with the  EU to an indefinite arrangement that involves accepting the withdrawal agreement and with  it the ­backstop. This all makes it much less ­acceptable to Brexiteers.Even those in the Cabinet who are sympathetic to the idea admit that it would face problems.One tells me: “I am not sure it is possible because so many people would trash it.”Norway-Plus would also require a new leader.Those close to May say she could not endorse a deal that did not end free movement.EVENthe Government loses heavily on Tuesday, it would still survive a vote of confidence.The Tory rebels and the DUP have been clear that they would vote for the Government in that debate.This poses a dilemma for Labour.It means that any attempt to bring down the Government would fail, and risk providing a rare moment of Tory unity. I understand, though, that opposition parties have been mulling a dferent approach – a censure motion in the PM.This would allow the House to express its disapproval of May’s handling of Brexit, without bringing down the Government.The thinking is that this might persuade the DUP to support it.  It would demonstrate that without them, the Government cannot win a confidence vote.Traditionally, these censure motions have been accompanied by a cut in salary for the minister concerned. But there are worries on the Opposition benches that such an approach could backfire because it would look too personal.So,the UK couldn’t now leave without a deal without facing catastrophic consequences, who should carry the can for that ONE theory doing the rounds this week is that May could resign as PM and advise the Queen to ask her de facto deputy, David Lidington, to form a government.This government would then, so the thinking goes, move towards a Norway-style deal.But I am told there would be resignations from the Cabinetthis happened, and a leading Tory backbencher warns that such a government would not be able to command the confidence of the House.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s pretty much where it ends.We would still be in the single market, accepting free movement, with a supposed “brake” we would never deploy.Worse, we would remain in an EU customs union too, to “avoid” the mythical hard border in Ireland no one will ever build.We would effectively still be EU members  with no vote, nor power to strike our own trade deals — wrecking Brexit’s central economic case.It’s a non-Brexit that only satisfies Remainers. The Leave victory was motivated by a desire for sovereignty, including  control over immigration. This fulfils none of it. It won’t fly.Even a second referendum is better  — though obviously “Remain” cannot be on the ballot, the first vote having ruled it out.CAN the Government not see the obvious conclusion voters draw from its zombie-apocalypse vision of a no-deal Brexit Downing Street trots out these scenarios — medicines, food and water running short and bodies going unburied — like they were inevitable. But it was their job to prepare us. Had they done so from , we would be in good shape.Chancellor Philip Hammond actually considered it irresponsible to spend money on it. The Government, incredibly, feared upsetting Brussels.Now they’re saying: “Brexit’s coming! Look how little we’ve done to be ready.”It is jaw-dropping negligence.He seriously claims Labour could secure all the benefits of the single market while defying its rules, including on immigration, and staying in a customs union while doing our own trade deals.Literally none of it is possible. Yet Corbyn fantasises that Brussels would just surrender to his superior charm and guile.Even as the Tories implode, Labour remains a laughing stock.EX-GCHQ chief Robert Hannigan is right to brand Facebook a threat to democracy.Most users cannot see its misuse of their data or the danger of the fake news it spreads.

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

Amid the sound and fury of this debate, do not lose sight of what the Government is doing.We are acting on the instructions of the people to take Britain out of the EU. No s and no buts.In June , . million people voted for Brexit, more than for any political party in British history. Over two years later, it’s time to settle the squabbles and get on with the job.I want MPs to support the Prime Minister’s agreement on Tuesday because it offers the surest path to Brexit.The alternatives – a second referendum or no Brexit at all – would fly in the face of the will of the British people. Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS. By , we will be investing an extra £ million in the NHS every week.Tomorrow I will go to Brussels to meet fellow Foreign Ministers from across the EU. We will discuss how to take forward our work to counter the common threats from terrorists and hostile states. That vital task will continue under the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal, which allows us to work together when it makes sense, and go our own way when we want.The real choice is not between the Prime Minister’s agreement and a perfect solution.The real choice is between this agreement and going back to square one and running the risk of Brexit not happening at all.

It’s almost customary down there.I don’t smoke weed and to the best of my knowledge nor does Meghan. I don’t know what I did with mine.I think I gave it away.Trevor and Meghan tied the knot on September , , at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.The wedding was a four-day affair and pictures have since shown drinking games on the beach in the run-up to the big day.The ceremony took place in front of  guests.One guest previously said: “The ceremony was over very quickly, in about  minutes. Then everyone hit the dance floor. It seemed they all just wanted to party.”A source claimed to Woman’s Day magazine that Meghans role as Rachel Zane on hit TV show Suits was to blame.The insider said: Meghan landed her role in Suits just a few months before they married.And despite being together for six years before getting hitched, things started to fall apart not long after the wedding.However, in a new book by biographer Andrew Morton it is suggested Meghan split with Trevor out of the blue.In Meghan, A Hollywood Princess, it is suggested the split came as a shock to Trevor and that Meghan posted her wedding and engagement rings back to him as a sign the marriage was over.Morton writes: “Whether she wanted to admit it to herself or not, Meghan, who once said she couldn’t imagine le without Trevor by her side, was now building a new world for herself.As Toronto was becoming more her home than LA, the dynamics in their relationship subtly altered.She was her own woman now, earning a steady income, making new friends on set and off, no longer dependent on her husband’s connections.Trevor began his career in the film industry as a production assistant, before working his way up the ladder.He is now a film producer and is most famous for the   romance movie Remember Me, starring Robert Pattinson.Alongside his producing work, he is also a manager for screenwriters, actors, novelists, and film directors in Los Angeles, Calornia.He is the executive producer on US TV shows Heathers and Snowfall.The claims from Meghans father come as reports suggest there is tension between herself at Kate Middleton.Meghan, , reportedly made the Duchess of Cambridge, , cry after Princess Charlottes flower girl dress fitting, with the pair also having been locked in a ghastly row over the treatment of staff.And The Sun exclusively revealed simmering tensions between brothers William, , and Harry are at the heart of the frostiness between the two couples.Meghan also faced some opposition from the Middleton family, who didn’t want to invite her to Pippa’s wedding last May.And a furious Duchess of Cambridge is said to have recently slapped down Meghan after she spoke rudely to a member of Kates staff telling her doing so was unacceptable.Meghan and husband Prince Harry are moving from their London pad, where they live next door to Prince William and Kate, to Frogmore Cottage ahead of the arrival of their baby in the spring of .Household staff were reportedly left astounded when she demanded air fresheners to fix the musty smell at St Georges Chapel before her wedding, but Buckingham Palace officials said no.And recently her assistant of just six months, Melissa Toubati, who played a pivotal role in the success of the Royal Wedding, quit the job after putting up with a lot.A royal insider has since claimed the reported tit for tat could bring the monarchy to its knees."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit pantomime over theresa loses","story":"NewsopinionBrexit pantomime is last bow for Theresa May as she loses controlThose fervent Brexiters have never settled on having a Remainer in charge.

Or she could charge ahead despite certain defeat and risk her premiership crashing in flames this week. Although cold-calling is banned in the Berkshire village of Sonning where she lives, the PM is hitting the phones on Sunday, desperately trying to persuade wavering MPs to back her Brexit withdrawal plan. Labour, SNP, DUP, other opposition MPs and at least  Tories are adamant that they will vote against her – and a confidence vote in the Government could follow immediately. Despite Cabinet ministers and backbench shop steward Sir Graham Brady pleading for delay, Mrs May stubbornly maintains in public that the vote will take place at .pm on Tuesday, even though she will be crucied.  A No  source said it is “one hundred per cent certain” the ision will go ahead on Tuesday, adding: “We are a hundred per cent focussed on winning it.” Divisions in the Tory party are already entrenched and MPs refer to each other by the C-word as often as they use Christian names. The atmosphere in the Commons Tea Room is so toxic, many MPs avoid it. Brexiteer Tory Andrew Bridgen says party deputy chairman James Cleverly gave him a friendly manhug when they met at London’s Carlton Club last week. But Mr Bridgen claims witnesses told him later that the moment he popped to the loo, Mr Cleverly badmouthed him behind his back.  Mr Cleverly did not comment but Mr Bridgen said: “The whole Tory party is now engaged in waging an uncivil war.” Mrs May had another bad day today, though it would only be newsshe had a good one. The PM’s claim that her Plan A is the only letter in the Cabinet’s alphabet was undermined by close ally Amber Rudd, with a Plan B. Work and Pensions Secretary Ms Rudd took to the airwaves to proclaim a Norway-plus option. This would see the UK retain access to the EU’s single market and also join a customs union.   Ms Rudd says she’s behind Mrs May’s plan but told Radio : “I’m just pointing out thatyou don’t vote for it, these are the other things that could happen.” The other things that WOULD happen under the Norway model are continuing, unlimited EU migration and a hefty annual payment to Brussels. Brexiteers would hit the roof. Even Ms Rudd saw she had gone too far and a DWP official broke protocol by entering the political arena. He sent an extraordinary press release after Ms Rudd had been on the Today programme saying: “She is fully behind the PM’s Brexit deal and is warning MPs about the potential impact on jobs of voting against.”   Ms Rudd is one of eight jockeying for Mrs May’s job. The others are Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Andrea Leadsom and Michael Gove. Commons leader Ms Leadsom and Home Secretary Mr Javid sparked fevered speculation that they would run on a joint ticket by sending MPs invites to a Christmas party to be hosted by them a week tomorrow. International Development Secretary Ms Mordaunt raised eyebrows when she followed a dozen local Tory associations on Twitter last week. She would need their backing in a leadership contest. One MP said her strings were being pulled by Environment Secretary Michael Gove infor a promise to make him Chancellor. Jeremy Corbyn is now trying to forge a deal between Labour, rebel Tories and the DUP which would see Mrs May toppled. Parliamentary number-crunchers say thatthey all ganged up on the PM, she would lose a confidence vote by ONE –  votes to . And that’sall Tory MPs stay loyal. Mrs May would then have  days to win another confidence vote but as the deadline lands on Christmas Day the process would most likely be wrapped up before the Parliamentary recess begins on December . Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces one more hurdle - a vote in Parliament on December . MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to about , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, threatening to vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. Not all are expected to live up to their threats. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They say they will vote down the deal. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. Theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. Unknown LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against.  If Mrs May loses a final confidence vote, and Mr Corbyn does not become PM by winning one, there would have to be a General Election on Thursday, January  – and no one wants that. There will be  amendments to the main motion on Tuesday but the Speaker will select no more than six. They will range from staying in a permanent customs union to cancelling Article  which takes us out of the EU on March  next year. Tories Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston today told the Sunday Mirror they will table proposals for a second referendum immediately Mrs May withdraws the vote, or loses it. Tory grandee Lord Heseltine today became the latest big beast to back a People’s Vote. The former Deputy PM said: “Our opponents are calling us traitors. But we are the British patriots.”Mrs May was hit by another Brexit resignation tonight when Will Quince quit as Parliamentary aide to Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson."},{"url":null,"title":"clubber slated unusual outfit goes","story":"NewsClubber slated for unusual outfit goes viral with comeback to nasty trollsLyla Rose Kharchi was attacked by online trolls after enjoying a night out with her girlfriends at a nightclub in Hanley, Stoke on TrentShareCommentsByHayley Parker:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsLyla Rose Kharchi, Evie Carlin and Ellie Evans were snapped by photographer as they queued outside the club\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA party-goer slated online for her Saturday night outfit has hit back at trolls after being horried by the nasty comments left by strangers.

One Hull mum fears the decision made by staff at the Hull primary school is down to laziness, with many parents gutted they wont see their children take to the stage. All key stage one pupils have been excluded from the annual tradition, despite complaints from a number of parents, Hull Live reports. However the schools head has defended the move, saying children still have a number of opportunities to celebrate the festive season. Mum-of-five, Carla Fernie, says her son has been quiet and subdued after realising he will not be performing in front of his family.  She said: All the parents are saying that it helps with their confidence but they [the school] are not getting it. Not doing it means they’re all missing out. “I’ve been speaking to a girl that goes to Stoneferry and they’re doing it. I know others at Gillshill and Buckingham Primary who do it too. “If they’ve got cousins in other schools then they’re all seeing them do the outfits but they don’t get to do that. They’re all missing out. “I just think it’s lazinessthe teachers won’t do it. I know they work hard but it’s quite sad.” Ms Fernie’s youngest son, Frankie, took part in a school nativity in  when he was in the early years foundation stage but won’t get the same chance this time around. She claims that all the school used to do Christmas performances before a new head teacher was appointed a couple of years ago.  Parents have been posting their upset online about not being able to see their children in action. Another mum said: “I remember as my cousins little boy did it last year, I’m gutted now. It’s like well why has it stopped.” A third parent added that she feels “sad that some are missing out”. “I know all of the children work hard, but things like plays and trips are things the kids enjoy and get excited about and I feel sad that some are missing out,” she said. Ms Fernie says she “felt sad” to see a post on Hull Live’s Family News page asking for pictures of nativities taking place in schools because it reminded her that her son was missing out. In a statement, Deborah Tague, head teacher at Westcott Primary said: “At Westcott Primary we try and make sure the children have as many opportunities as possible to celebrate Christmas. “We put on a Foundation Stage Nativity Performance and continue to do this as we feel this is important to our school community. “Pupils will also be wrapping presents for family members at a Christmas Wrap event, visiting a pantomime at the Freedom Centre, going Christmas Carol signing in the community, attending a Carol Service at St Columba’s Church and having a Christmas dinner and party. We’ve even got a Christmas jumper day. “Christmas is very important to Westcott and we look forward to celebrating the festive season with pupils and parents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results saturdays winning national","story":"NewsLotto results: Saturdays winning National Lottery numbers for £.million jackpotFind out the winning numbers for the National Lottery, Lotto Millionaire Raffle and Thunderball tonightShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsTickets are on sale until .pm today \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt could well be your lucky dayyou have the winning numbers for tonights National Lottery jackpot, a whopping pound.million.

The -year-old has revealed how they were once close in a series of heartfelt letters his daughter sent to him saying I love you with all my heart – now and forever’. The affectionate letters are addressed to ‘Daddy’. In one she vows: All I want to do is make you proud… and I promise, no matter what, I’ll do it.

The fall-out with Harry and Meghan came after he staged paparazzi pictures shortly before the couple’s wedding in May and then suffered two heart attacks, preventing him walking his daughter down the aisle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor. He hit back at grievous lies against him and produced evidence in the form of photographs, medical statements and even a faded plane ticket that he says proves he is telling the truth: He insisted: I had two heart attacks, the second of which the doctor called a widow-maker and nearly killed me.

Newlyweds Meghan and Harry will reportedly not spend Christmas with Kate and William following rumours of a rt between the sisters-in-law. It was thought the frostiness between the Royal Fab Four had been caused by disagreements between to two Duchesses. But new revelations suggest it’s actually the BROTHERS increasingly strained relationship that’s at the heart of the ision. Harry is even believed to have accused his older brother of trying to wreck his relationship with US actress Meghan.  The rumours come just two weeks after Harry and Meghan unveiled plans to move out of Kensington Palace - where the Cambridges also live - and relocate to Windsor instead. From the two young boys once united by tragedy, to rivals increasingly ided in love, things have never been worse between the pair, The Sun reports. According to the source, Diana’s boys started squabbling back in  when -year-old Meghan first began dating Harry, . Prince William is said to be incensed by his younger brother’s over-protectiveness of Meghan and his failure to see reason with her. “He will brook absolutely no criticism of Meghan — and he is so sensitive he often sees criticism or negativity where there isn’t any,” a source told The Sun.  Just as any other brothers, the pair have a long history of tfs, tantrums and sibling rivalries. William, , was said to be furious with Harry back in  when he was secretly filmed stripping naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The pair are also notorious for teasing one another about who’s got the least hair, and who’s the better soldier. But more famous than their fallings out was their unity in through the toughest times. And now that bond is now said to be hanging by a tether.  The first of the threads allegedly snapped after William was first introduced to Meghan, and, shortly afterwards, offered Harry some unwelcome brotherly advice. Knowing his brother to be glitzy-eyed for the American actress, William is said to have warned his brother to take it slowly. A Sun source close to the Royal Family has said: “William told his brother they knew nothing about her background, her intentions, what she was really like. “He just wanted to stress that becoming part of the Royal Family is a massive undertaking and the pressure and scrutiny is unrelenting. Was Meghan the right one  “Harry went mental, he accused his brother of trying to finish his romance before it had begun. The brothers’ relationship has not really recovered.”  However, it’s said William wasn’t the only to voice his concerns over Meghan, with similar sentiments echoing down from the upper echelons of the monarchy. Another courtier said: “A lot of people in the family objected. Who really knows what the concerns were  Was it Meghan’s background  Her father and dreadful half-sister  Because she was an outspoken American  Divorced  “Harry stood up for Meghan very forcibly. He really loves her.” The Middleton’s were also slow to reach out a hand to Harry’s signicant other, who voiced concerns over inviting Meghan to Pippa’s wedding last May, in fear she’d overshadow the bride-to-be’s big day. Eventually she was asked but only opted to attend the evening reception.  Hoping to make amends when she moved to London last November, engaged to Harry, Meghan reportedly tried desperately to integrate herself with her in-laws. Hoping to be taken under Kate’s wing, the Princess was left disappointed to find Kate - suffering from motion sickness from her pregnancy with Louis, and looking after George and Charlotte - too busy to spend time with her. A royal source said: “Meghan hoped Kate would show her the ropes. But, equally understandably, Kate was busy. She didn’t have as much time for her as Meghan would have liked. They were at very dferent places in their lives. “Meghan felt quite let down. She had really tried but felt rebuffed, and so just stopped trying.” Harry did not take this lightly and spoke to William about making Meghan feel welcome. William, however, took his we’s side.

Samantha Cohen, , will leave her role as a key member of the Kensington Palace staff after Meghan and Harry have their first child in Spring. Nicknamed Samantha the Panther in royal circles, the Australian also served as a communications secretary during her  year career working for the Windsor family. Ms Cohen stepped into the role reportedly at the request of Harry and Meghan after Edward Lane Fox left at the end of five years of service.  It is believed the Duchess wanted to hire her on a permanent basis after she left her position at Buckingham Palace, but Ms Cohen refused. The planned departure of one of the Queens most trusted aides comes shortly after Meghans personal assistant Melissa Touabti also quit, just six months after the Royal wedding at Windsor Castle in May. A source close to Meghan told the Sunday Times: Sam will be a huge loss. Going forward, Meghan might need someone cut from a slightly dferent cloth to traditional courtiers, who is not a career civil servant or royal insider.  Ms Cohen was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order by the Queen in  having been the first woman to hold the press secretary job. She rose through the ranks after applying to be a media minder at Buckingham Palace  years ago, while on a trip to London from her home country. The mother-of-three is held in high regard by the royal family and has been described as unstuffy and deeply committed to the Queen. It is Ms Cohens feisty attitude that won her the Panther nickname. Sources claim she has acted as a make-up advisor to Meghan and helped her understand the intricacies of the royal family. The Sunday Times source also revealed the Duchess early morning routine and warned that new aides would have to be adaptable and patient.  Meghan has previously said that she wakes up at .am to do yoga, which heals the mind. News of Ms Cohens impending departure comes after Ms Toubati quit her job. Before working as a close aide to Meghan the -year-old was employed by Robbie Williams and his we Ayda Field. The couple have links to the royal family through their close friendship with Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank. Their daughter Theodora, six, was one of Eugenies bridesmaids at her wedding last month.  An insider said: Robbie Williams is a lively character, but she worked for him longer than she worked for Meghan. When Ms Toubati quit, a Palace source was authorised to pay tribute to her and the role she played in helping organise Prince Harry and Meghans wedding. They said: Melissa is a hugely talented person. She played a pivotal role in the success of the Royal Wedding and will be missed by everyone in the Royal Household.

Where has everyone come from, why are they never usually shopping here and WHERE ARE THE AFTER EIGHTS  Of course your bag for le will likely split under the strain of a four-kilo Norfolk Bronze and three bottles of Baileys. You cant be blamed for deciding its not worth buying a mountain of potatoes and enough party food to sink a battleship. If you decide its time to take a breather in the cafe and tuck into a Christmas dinner you dont have to cook yourself, you might wonder which of the supermarkets has the best offering. Lucky for you, the Manchester Evening News has tried and tested them - with a mixed bag of results. Morrisons It would appear the Morrisons cafe is the most in-demand in the city, reports Emily Heward. Theres a half hour wait on food and a bum on nearly every seat when we arrive on a Friday lunchtime, so we decide to go away and come back later. The queues died down a bit but theres still a -minute wait when we . The menu sounds promising, as supermarket caffs go. Alongside the traditional turkey dinner theres a veggie version with a caullower cheese tart, a salmon thermidor or a turkey and stuffing roll, plus a selection of starters.   We order a turkey and a veggie dinner and settle in to a booth with a view of the car park, where I once saw a man practising his saxophone scales in a trolley bay. Twenty minutes later, a harried-looking kitchen worker comes over to tell us theres no caullower cheese tarts left. Back the veggie goes to re-join the queue and change her order for a beetroot burger. While shes waiting the kitchen worker reappears with my turkey dinner - along with an unbidden plate of dry potatoes and veg, which apparently now constitutes the vegetarian option. He places a jug of gravy beside it, hesitantly. Its meat gravy, so I dont knowshell want it, he said. The floury roast potatoes behave like a particularly absorbent sponge and sap all the moisture out of your mouth, though the seasoning is almost there. They are definitely helped along with a drizzle of gravy - a liberal spread of cranberry sauce has to suffice for the vegetarian  The mash is better than the roasties but the veg... Oh, the veg. It would appear the whole half hour wait has been spent slowly boiling it into oblivion. The turkey is unnervingly brown, even underneath the gravy which is splashed all over the plate like a massacre. I show the picture to two friends later, independently of one another. Is that a dead squirrel  both asked. The buttery meat flakes like tuna at the prod of a fork. It tastes marginally better than it looks but thats the best we can say for it. A solitary pig in a blanketand a sagey stuffing ball saves the meal from an even grimmer fate. Haphazard service aside, the staff were lovely and couldnt be more apologetic about the waiting time and the veggie palaver, taking that dish off the bill before we even have chance to complain. Portions here are fairly generous for the priceand theres a cheap meal deal giving you two courses for pound. or three courses for pound.. But low cost and good value do not co-exist here.   MS This Christmas dinner reminds us of the film Love Actually - featuring a few star turns from the likes of Emma Thompson and Bill Nighy , interspersed with some dismal performances from Keira Knightley and the annoying boy who learns the drums . The meat was salty and tender, with a good quality gravy whichdidn’t taste like it had come from a Bisto tin. The roast potatoes were crispy and soft on the inside, reports Rebecca Day. The stuffing was the highlight - rich and meaty, with a strong taste of sage.   And the cranberry sauce was delightful - zingy and sweet. The vegetables were a bit disappointing - the carrots and sprouts tasted overcooked. No one likes a soggy sprout. The Yorkshire puddingwas pretty average as well - the texture was spongy rather than light and pillowy. Activating full festive mode, we ordered a gingerbread lattetoo. The mountain of whipped cream on top was unnecessarily indulgent, making it more of a dessert than a drink. It’s the type of coffee that would leave an Italian connoisseur squirming. I downed it before I even started the meal which was ill-advised as I was stuffed full of cream and sugar before even embarking on the main event. But - Christmas.   At pound., the food isn’t cheap - especiallyyou’re nipping in for a bite to eat during a shopping trip. Paying pound. in total for a meal and drink seems a bit extravagant, pushing up towards pub lunch prices. The MS cafe on Exchange Square is absolutely heaving when I visit on a Tuesday lunchtime but the staff are prepared for it, operating like a well-oiled machine. When I arrive in the queue I’m greeted by a cafe assistant who makes small talk before politely guiding me to the till. After making my order I’m handed a tracker which alerts members of staff to my whereabouts when the food is prepared. Theres no messing about. There’s a calm and comforting ambiance to an MS cafe which is hard to replicate where. I feel like my heart rate instantly drops when I enter, despite it being so busy. I’m surrounded by elderly people and young families having a nice natter. Ahhhh, I could sit here all day. Very British.   Asda When I arrive at Asda to test out its menu, I quickly find the shop has just an Express Diner, reports Matthew Cooper. What does that mean  - I reply. It means they don’t serve the whole Asda cafe menu. In fact, they don’t serve much by the looks of what’s on offer. There are two pizzas sitting on hot plates and a box of chips further down the counter which are sitting in a puddle of their own condensation inside their box. What they ARE selling is the Christmas dinner pizza, which is topped with turkey chunks, stuffing cubes, gigantic pigs in blankets and cranberry sauce. It costs pound for the entire pizza or pound. for a hefty slice and it’s hard to argue with that price. I’ll take one. Except they dont have any to hand, so I have to sit and wait while they chuck one in the oven for me.   I find a seat in the predominantly empty dining area waiting room, although I’m not sure what the people scattered round are waiting for, except for the world to pass them by. Or for the staff to cook their pizzas maybe. There is an eerie silence present and the predominant sound is the low buzzing of the lights and a distant frenzy of shoppers in the background buying mince pies by the dozen. Other than that it’s dead air. Then my two slices of pizza turn up. Christmas dinner on a pizza is a great idea on paper, but then so is socialism. How much melted cheddar do you have over your dinner on Christmas Day  Probably not much, that’s because the two don’t pair up particularly well. There’s also no cranberry sauce to be seen, so essentially what I have are certain parts of a Christmas feast stuck to a cheese base like velcro. I ask for a second opinion from the pigeon that’s been skulking around by throwing it a cube of turkey. It approves. If it’s good enough for a garbage dove it’s good enough for me - especially at pound. a slice.   Tesco How does a supermarket ensure theyre not going to ruin a perfectly good roast dinner  Well, dont try and make a roast dinner in the first place, reports Daisy Jackson. Tesco have shunned the conventional meat-and-five-veg-and-some-more-meat-wrapped-inside-another-meat format and instead stuck to a cafe offering, with a selection of festive paninis, toasties and sandwiches and some syrup-laden hot drinks too. Yeah, you heard that right - festive panini. Theres the pigs under blankets paniniwhich is served with a Bechemal sauce , a ham hock and piccalilli sandwich , and a brie and cranberry toastie . What makes these dferent from the sandwiches lined up in the fridges downstairs is that these ones are crushed inside a panini press before you eat them.   Nothing screams Christmas quite like a flat, warm baguette, eh  There are a few sarnies served at room temperature, such as a Christmas staple of turkey, stuffing and bacon . The verdict is Basic, but actually quite nice. On to the hot stuff, and that brie and cranberry toastie. Asa sandwich stuffed with cheese wasnt quite enough, one slice of the bread here is topped with a melted cheese crust, like a croque monsieur. Its a nice touch in principal, but in reality its complete overkill. The process of warming it back up again creates a weirdly salty cheese crisp, like the sort of thing that forms in the bottom of your oven when your cheese on toast overflows. When I pull the two halves of white bread apart, molten brie makes a speedy escape and pools on the plate, gting me with a fondue set-up for my crusts. This part Im on board with.   Theres a decent selection of festive bakes too, including a Viennese whirl take on a mince pie, and some mini swiss rolls with reindeer faces jammed onto one end. Seasonal drinks specials include the typical selection of gingerbread lattes and black forest hot chocolates - we opt for a mulled fruit warmer and a spiced apple warmer, both pound., and barely distinguishable from one another. Theyre enormous, and the mulled spice proves sickly without the body of red wine behind it. We sit and nurse our pints of hot mulled water while taking in the sweeping panorama of the pyjama aisle below us, pausing occasionally to spit out shards of star anise. All in all though, this is a perfectly pleasant supermarket Christmas experience. Not one youd choose on the big day, but itll do the job for a Wednesday lunch break.   Sainsburys Well theyve come up trumps with this years Christmas ad - people cant get enough of plug boy - but how does Sainsburys fare in the festive dinner stakes  I say dinner, thats what us Mancs call lunch, but at .pm on a Friday afternoon it was practically verging on tea time, reports Emma Gill. If there had been a mad rush for the turkey roast it had certainly died down by the time I took a seat. It doesnt seem to appear on a menu as such, thats mainly breakfast and other mains, but a sign behind the counter assures me I can get a full turkey roast dinner for a reasonable pound.. The fridge full of festive sarnies offers a wide iety for those wanting something quicker.   Judging by the empty shelf behind the Pigs in Blankets Toastie sign, , it seems thats proving a winner. Sitting down with my impressively-sized mug of tea and mince pie, well at pound. for both then why not, my meals here in  minutes. Its not so much service with a smile as service with a telling off for not having my number displayed high enough. How am I supposed to know the piece of card folds out to stand on end  Now in my younger days I wouldnt have batted an eye lid at frozen spuds and Yorkshires, but having lived with a chef for the past  years, Im not so easily pleased. They taste OK though and the meat is nice and succulent, with meaty gravy that doesnt taste like its out of a tub. Theres stuffing and cranberry sauce and to my delight, hiding cheekily between the spuds, are two mini sausages. I say delight, I was pleased by their presence, not so much their size and the absence of any piggy blanket. It makes a refreshing change to not have to fight over them mind - were a bit of a sausage-loving family in my house. The caullower cheese is a pleasant surprise too and cooked to perfection. But the only greens on my plates are sprouts.   Im not a fan of sprouts anyway but theres no way Id been eating these mushy balls. Someone didnt follow the instructions on the packet did they  Overall its a decent meal, especially for the price. With cardboard baubles hanging from the ceiling and Feed The World belting out from the speakers, its almost enough to make me feel festive. Andyoure heading to Sainsburys caff this Christmas, dont fret, theres no need to be afraid. I might have to get my pigs in blankets in a toastie next time.

Hundreds of protesters were arrested as they prepared to battle with French security forces this morning.Potential weapons, including gas cannisters, flash ball guns, baseball bats and petanque balls, were confiscated as the fourth weekend of confrontations over living costs got under way. Tourists landmarks, including the Efel Tower, have been closed while shops have been boarded up to avoid looting. Street furniture has been removed to avoid metal bars from being used as projectiles.  By am, nearly  people believed to be linked to the movement were in custody - mainly for carrying banned items, but also for violent order offences. Less than two hours later, at lunchtime, the total number of arrests was , and quickly rose to , then  at around pm local time, according to French media.By mid-afternoon, more than  people had been arrested as the confrontation intensied and protesters began hurling rocks while shouting Macron, resign in the worst rioting in Paris for decades.  Despite violent incidents on the Champs-Elysees and several attempts to block the Porte Maillot carriageway, no major incidents have been reported, police say. However, water canon and tear gas has been used in attempts to hold back protesters, who have started ripping shop boards off to form a barrier in the middle of the Champs-Elysees.Wheelie bins and boards have also been set on fire. US President Donald Trump tweeted his support for France this afternoon, saying: The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries , in order to maybe protect the environment.Chanting We Want Trump! Love France. A police source said: More than seventy have been placed under formal investigation, while a total of  have been arrested.Many were carrying a range of potential weapons, which suggested they were going to get involved in disturbances. More arrests are expected.  About , French security forces have been deployed across the country. Of these, about , are in Paris to avoid a repeat of last Saturdays mayhem when rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees bouled, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti directed at President Emmanuel Macron. Protesters, using social media, have billed the weekend as Act IV in a dramatic challenge to Macron and his policies. The protests, named after the high-visibility safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes. Demonstrations have since swelled into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron - a challenge made more dficult to handle since the movement has no formal leader.  Authorities say the protests have been hijacked by far-right and anarchist elements bent on violence and stirring up social unrest in a direct affront to Macron and the security forces. Nonetheless, -year-old Macron, whose popularity is at a low ebb according to polls, has been forced into making the first major U-turn of his presidency by abandoning a fuel tax. Despite the climbdown, the yellow vests continue to demand more concessions from the government, including lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy costs, better retirement provisions and even Macrons resignation. One of them, Eric Drouet, a truck driver, called on protesters to storm into the Elysee presidential palace. An Elysee official has said intelligence suggested that some protesters would come to the capital to vandalise and to kill.  Macron, who has not spoken in public since he condemned last Saturdays disturbances while at the G summit in Argentina, will address the nation early next week, his office said. Yesterday evening, he visited a group of police in their barracks outside Paris, his office said. Navigating his biggest crisis since being elected  months ago, Macron has left it largely to his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal in public with the turmoil and offer concessions. But he is under pressure to speak more fully as his administration tries to regain the initiative following three weeks of unrest that are the worst since the  student riots.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0a4bb3f394d.jpg ","title":"i left my drink for about 20 seconds woman tells of being spiked on dundee night out","story":"A woman has relived the horror of her drink being spiked in a Dundee students’ union after campaigners called for lids to be placed on drinks in pubs and clubs.Girls Against Spiking have launched a campaign with the backing of Police Scotland.It was revealed only a quarter of drink spiking crimes are detected, with only four recorded crimes in Scotland in .Rose Crowe, , a sales assistant from Invergowrie, had her drink spiked at DUSA The Union, calling the incident “a complete violation”.The frightening episode, which took place in December  when she was , is thought to have been the result of a prank.She said: “It is definitely the worst thing that has ever happened to me on a night out.“I went to the bar and paid for a drink then spotted some of my other friends and I went over to hug them.“I left my drink for about  seconds before I came back to get it, so it was enough time to have been spiked.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Darren Boyd, of Thornyflat Street in Ayr, admitted to assaulting David Mackie on July  this year at McLean Street in Ayr. He also owned up to uttering threats of violence towards him. Boyd appeared before Sherf Scott Pattison at Ayr Sherf Court last week. The court heard how the -year-old ‘repeatedly punched’ Mr Mackie on the head. Depute Fiscal Andrew Lazzarin explained: “At around pm, the complainers were at their home when they heard a noise and went to see what it was. There was a household item lying in the garden. They went to speak to the neighbour about why this was there. “The accused was in the neighbour’s house and assaulted the complainer by repeatedly punching him on the head. “The complainer then went home and the accused went back into the neighbour’s house. The police were contacted and the complainer had a small cut on his lip - he was taken to AE. “Police were unable to find the accused as he had left the neighbours house at that time. “On another occasion, it seems that the complainers were driving to the locus and the accused was shouting towards them saying, “I am going to kick your c**t in”.  “Police were contacted again about these matters.” Defending Boyd, Tony Currie added that Mr Mackie was the neighbour of his partner and there had been “ongoing issues” between them. He said: “These incidents were because of his partner’s ongoing issues with the complainer. “She was receiving ongoing complaints from them. “He had been at his partner’s house at the moment the complainer came to the door, who was kicking the door and was challenging towards his partner. “She was heavily pregnant at the time.” Mr Currie added that there has been no further issues in the interim and the couple are hoping to relocate. Sherf Pattison said: “I was considering sending you to jail - you need to know that this type of violence cannot continue.” As an alternative to custody, Sherf Pattison ordered Boyd to carry out a community payback order with  hours of unpaid work to be completed in nine months.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsSomerset Park damaged after car crashes into ground\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Reporter Hilary Scott went along to find out more...PRIORSFORD Primary School welcomed a new addition to the register this week, and she goes by the name of Peggy.As I signed in at the school, I note the reason for my visit as meeting Priorsfordrsquos new pupil who will be joining Mrs Sharprsquos P class.But Peggy isnrsquot your average pupil. In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-job-adverts-among-the-most-clicked-on-linkedin-reveals","story":"The prospect of working for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the Queen or the Princess Royal had

range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Whatrsquos the story  Read on.Historical highlightsThough the surrounding area has been farmed for at least , years, Tobermory itself ndash which means Tobar Mhoire or ldquoMaryrsquos well in Gaelic - was established in  by the British Fisheries Society as a herring port.Kelp was an early boom industry , but tourism took over in the th century following visits by the German composer Felix Mendelssohn in  on his way to Staffa, and Queen Victoria in .During World War Two, the town was home to the Royal Navy training base HMS Western Isles.Tobermory is a place that fires the imagination.

Currently closed for the season, due to re-open at Easter.Just along the road is the excellent Tobermory Distillery , one of the oldest in Scotland established , which produces two distinct single malt whiskies.

If you prefer classical music, the intimate Mendlessohn on Mull festival takes place in early July.Tobermory has some of the loveliest and most accessible island walks in Scotland. My own favourite is the .km circuit through woods to the picturesque Rubha nan Gall ndash ldquoStangerrsquos Point - lighthouse, built in  by David Stevenson.Those looking for a whole day of sightseeing, nature-spotting adventures, meanwhile, will want to opt for one of the many bus, boat or bike tours that operate all year round.

The only bad thing about the starter of Borders game Pithiviers is that for pound., itrsquos slight: two large mouthfuls of immaculate flaky pastry and sausage-like filling which judiciously blends lean, pungent game meat with enough herby fat to render it irresistible. Itrsquos accompanied by quince pureacutee scented with Christmas-y spices, and a syrupy, sublime gravy that tastes like reduced essence of dark meaty juices baked onto a roasting pan.For the same price, the octopus carpaccio just doesnrsquot cut it. Itrsquos a stunner to look at, like antique Italian terrazzo flooring, but therersquos nothing really to relish about it, other than the classy extra virgin olive oil dressing, because the octopus itself, shaved breathtakingly thin, possibly using a mandolin, needs salt and retains only a memory of fish flavour, so that is drowned out by acidic lemon flesh, croutons, and capers.My main course John Dory, on the bone, as ordered, has been char-grilled. Its topping- capers, lemon, croutons, again- repeats the dressing on the octopus, save for the odd bit of diced tomato flesh, olive, and three shavings of fennel. Isnrsquot it the job of the person taking the order to point out unforeseen overlaps  Shoulder of Highland lamb arrives dark-crusted from the rotisserie spit, fragrant from its pre-seasoning of rosemary, cinnamon, paprika, and more. Once more its relish looks like an afterthought: capers , olives , tomato pulp , and too much spring onion. So, fantastic meat, but inadequately thought-through accompaniments.

Its almond and pistachio packed granola has the gritty, sweet stickiness of those praline peanuts you get in French fairgrounds itrsquos not unpleasant though, albeit I donrsquot appreciate the rancid pecans. I guess the sorbet must be pear, but its flavour is anonymous.Chocolate tart is vastly superior, an exceptional filling with a consistency somewhere between mayonnaise and mousse, unimpeachable pastry thatrsquos thin, nicely golden, and evenly baked, flanked by a quenelle of simple, clean-tasting milk ice cream.No alcohol, no coffee, yet with service our bill for two comes to pound.

They had just had their first child and Jacine, who worked in corporate marketing, was mulling over ways to better achieve a work-le balance.\"The nine-to-five wasnt working,\" she recalls. \"I wanted to spend more time with my daughter Mahya when she was still young. I felt bad going back to work when she was nine months old and putting her into nursery. Everything came to a head.\"Jacine, , decided to take a three-month sabbatical from her job so they could stay on in Uganda and figure out a plan. \"By the end of that three months we decided to start a business,\" she says.That business was making rum. Jacine, who grew up in South London, has proud Jamaican roots. Her grandparents were part of the Windrush generation who had arrived in the UK during the s.\"I married into a beautul Ugandan family and spent a lot of time in Uganda and Kenya where I had seen lots of sugar cane,\" she says. \"I was asking for rum and I was never able to get any. I found this very confusing and would say: Do you know what we do with the sugar cane in Jamaica \"That got us thinking: Why is there no rum coming out of Uganda when there is sugar cane here  and Where are all the African rums on the global stage  Then we looked wider beyond rum at where Africa figures in the world of fine spirits.\"The continent gets flooded with spirits made all over the world but in terms of home-grown African spirits ndash considering the amazing natural produce ndash we were perplexed at how few there were. It became a mission to showcase Africa in the world of fine spirits.\"Pauls favourite tipple has long been whisky. \"We dont really drink rum in East Africa,\" he says. \"For me, marrying into a Caribbean family was an education. My drink was always Scotch whisky, but when you go to a Caribbean party, you cant really bring Scotch whisky hellip\"Jacine shakes her head, laughing heartily at the notion. \"Her relatives taught me about Jamaican rum and introduced me to all the brands,\" Paul adds. \"It made me wonder why I had never tried rum before. When it is made well it is a beautul spirit.\"Together the couple began to learn more about rums from across the Caribbean islands while pondering how to make their own East African iety. \"We had the idea to launch Matugga not having any experience in the sector,\" says Jacine. \"We saw a gap in the market and went for it.\"Everything had to reflect our positioning which was Africa and the UK ndash this interesting duality ndash and nobody  was doing that. We also had the innovative idea for our rum to be smoky.

Initially the duo worked with a contract distiller but since moving to Scotland have been able to begin production in their own facility at Brucefield Industry Park, West Lothian.Their move to Scotland came about when Paul, a civil engineer by trade, began studying for an MSc in Brewing and Distilling at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. The couple have fallen in love with their new base since arriving last year. Livingston is home now.Paul is the master distiller for Matugga with Jacine, who has experience in business start-ups alongside her marketing background, taking on the role as CEO.They make an impressive and formidable team. Jacine is the more outgoing of the two, warm and gregarious, while Paul is a little shyer and softly spoken but clearly every bit as driven as his we. He admits that ideas for new recipes are constantly percolating in his mind.Later, when Jacine is getting her photograph taken over by the rum casks, Paul talks me through some his latest \"experiments\" for future Matugga limited edition expressions. His eyes light up as he speaks. This is a man who has clearly found his vocation.\"I almost cant sleep at night,\" he says with a grin. \"I have so many ideas. It is only through having our own distillery that you begin to realise what is possible. You dont really understand a spirit until you have smelled and tasted it being made from the start.\"By doing that you get to know where all those little flavours come from, the bits that you dont usually get to taste because they never make it to the bottle. It is a huge spectrum.\"His latest prototype, says Jacine, has sent them down a new and unexpected road. A ripple of excitement passes between them as they talk about the future. \"There is definitely going to be more,\" they say in unison.\"We have released a Mavuno range with a special edition each year,\" says Paul. Beside him, Jacine adds: \"We use a lot of Swahili ndash the language of East Africa ndash and Mavuno means harvest. This is the harvest of Pauls experimentation.

One of the options offered to those who contributed was the opportunity to purchase a private rum cask.\"Similar to whisky cask ownership, you would buy a rum cask and we would look after it for three years,\" says Paul. \"Rum doesnt need a long maturation phase. We project within three years it would be very delicious and ready for bottling.\"We think that will coincide with the point that rum becomes the next thing. If you are going to buy a cask, you dont want to buy it in three years time, you want to buy it now.\"Over the past decade, the gin-making industry has mushroomed in Scotland with a raft of new distilleries and craft brands.

They are delighted to be at the forefront of that revolution. \"The magical thing is that now we are here, places have really inspired us,\" says Jacine.\"We are talking about bringing Africa to Scotland, but we want to showcase our own foraging and exploring Scotland in terms of flavours. It is about discovery for us.\"We are working on a new line that had so much goodwill from people in Livingston and beyond. They seem to be really excited about what we are doing.\"It has all been really positive. It is an adventure. We honestly didnt know how we were going to be received. We rocked up here with our family and were hoping everyone would be welcoming, which they have been. There has been a lot of excitement.\"Pauls love of whisky was a big factor in their choice of base. \"Absolutely,\" he says. \"It could only be Scotland. The quality of Scotch whisky is the highest in the world in terms of distilled spirits and I knew thatwe were going to align ourselves with good standards it was going to be in Scotland.\"He has found other upsides too. \"The benefit of Scottish water is that there are not a lot of minerals in it. It is very soft water. You can imagineyou had a kettle down south, the inside would be covered in white stuff.\"We would have to remove all that stuff from the water and it would clog up the purication filter. It is an absolute nightmare to make wine, beer or spirits from.\"The water here is fantastic for brewing and distilling. The weather helps, too, because we generally have cool temperatures and a moderate summer in Scotland, so we are not over-ageing our rum stock. It is gently maturing in a way you can control it.\"If you were distilling, for example, in the United Arab Emirates you would need to put the casks in a basement with air conditioning. Scotland is perfect to mature spirits.\"The name Matugga comes from family owned land in Uganda. \"Traditionally in Uganda when you get married your father gives you a piece of land to grow crops and feed your family,\" says Paul.\"My brother was given a piece of land he didnt particularly like, so he decided to sell it and buy land with my mum in Matugga.

I thought: I think we are being told something here. We are being told to do something that is sugar cane based hellip\"Jacine takes up the thread. \"It was a very spiritual time,\" she says. \"My family is from Jamaica and Africa is my heritage. It was almost like a homecoming and being welcomed by my Ugandan family.\"It was where we had the idea to make rum. This land represents Uganda and the whole continent.

Industry insiders are reluctant to talk up low fares amid concerns that some airlines may not be able to keep Scottish routes profitable.A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said: ldquoEarly December is traditionally a quiet time for aviation and therefore a great time to get a good deal on flights.ldquoCanny shoppers or those wishing to get away before a hectic Christmas are all picking up great bargains.ldquoScottish passengers have the choice of more destinations than ever and wersquore seeing increasing numbers of passengers travelling year on year.The pound collapsed the early morning of the Brexit vote and has been under pressure ever since. The UK is due to leave the EU at the end of March with fears rising of a no deal scenario and its devastating impact on Sterling.Last month holiday operator Thomas Cook - whose planes do a lot of the heavy lting of tourists from Scotland to sunshine destinations - announced that its profits had noseed after lower exchange rate and higher summer UK temperatures.Also last month regional airline FlyBe, amid low profits, a weak pound and Brexit uncertainty, put itself up for sale.Throwaway fares - prices so low would-be travellers book them on impulse - might sound like good news. And any airline will discount to put bums on seats. However, travel experts stress that the cost of a holiday - in sterling terms - is still high. You might get to Fuerteventura this month for the cost of apeak train fare from Glasgow to Edinburgh. Yet when you get there you will have to pay in euros for accommodation and food.The prospect of a clf-edge departure from the EU worries continental holiday providers. The head of Spainrsquos national tourism agency in the UK said a no-deal Brexit would be lsquoa disasterrsquo for his country.Discounts are particularly steep on flights to Germany, Ireland Scandinavia, where costs for Scottish tourists with pounds in their pocket are particularly high and where the weather is far less warm than the CanariesNorwegian this month has s to Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm for under pound. Ryanair had s to some of same cities - but not always the same airports - for between pound and pound.The low-cost airline this week was offering December weekend s to the Baian city of Memmingen for pound. and Derry in Northern Ireland for pound. from Edinburgh. Fares have since edged up to around pound each.Next weekend flights to the sunny Canarian island of Lanzarote are down to pound , leaving on Friday and ing on Monday.Industry insiders stressed that the airline recently cut the size of its free hand luggage and was therefore in a position to offer lower fares. Its change, which came in to place on November , has angered some consumer groups. One Spanish organisation said the move was ldquoabusive.Experts also said travellers should look out for more deals in January - when EasyJet has s from Glasgow to Venice for pound, including a more generous hand luggage allowance than its rival.For the week beginning January  Ryanair has fares from Edinburgh for poundto Alicante and Fuerteventura, pound to Porto, pound to Dublin, pound to Derry, according to the Scottish-based fares comparison site SkyScanner.For the same week, SkyScanner showsfares of pound from Prestwick to Malta on Ryanair, pound from Glasgow to Dusseldorf on Eurowings and pound to New York via London on British Airways.Hugh Aitken, of SkyScanner, explained: ldquoIn most cases, airline pricing works in tranches ndash a limited number of very low prices, for example, may be available for a limited number of seats.ldquoThere are generally multiple lsquofare bandsrsquoavailable for each flight. Once a certain fare band has been booked up, the next one will be displayed, and this will likely be at a higher price, as you might expect with a supply-demand model.ldquoAs an example, The Herald found a Prestwick to Tenere flight for pound ndash the price is now pound, most probably as the lower fare band has been booked up.ldquoAirlines want to ensure they maximise loads and encourage travel, so travellers may additionally see lower prices and sales for travel during January: this tends to be a slightly quieter month when compared to peak holiday times such as Easter.The flip-side of the falling pound is that more people from overseas are travelling to holiday in Scotland. Even flights to sunshine destinations - such as Italy and Spain - once filled with Scots are seeing growing numbers of inbound passengers, say insiders.

It was a bottle of South African sparkling wine by the vintner Graham Beck. The wine was good, but it wasnrsquot special - it was the occasion which made the wine great.It was  years ago, and Hoyrsquos we Mary had just given birth to their first baby Emily. The couple were living in South Africa, working in the wine business, and after their daughterrsquos christening, Justin and Mary journeyed into the bush and drank the sparkling Beck amid one of the most beautul landscapes on earth with their newborn baby beside them.lsquoIt was probably not the best sparkling wine in the world, but for that occasion it was absolutely perfect,rsquo says Hoy. Thatrsquos what wine does, it underscores the events in le which matter. Mary laughs and says hersquos making them sound like terrible parents, drinking in the wild with their baby.Hoy hates the expression lsquowine expertrsquo but like it or not thatrsquos what he is, one of Scotlandrsquos best connoisseurs. Spend an hour in his company and yoursquoll learn more about wine than you could from a decade of experimenting as an amateur wine buff on your own.As National Wine Week comes to an end today, Hoy is singing the praises of wine and the role it plays in human culture and society. Wine has been with us for at least  years - the earliest archaeological record of wine-making is dated to about BC in Armenia. Wine writer Aaron Pott says there is a theory, though, that wine is much older - that wine began when some ancient human lsquochanced upon some wild vines in late fall, their bunches well past ripe, rotten and slightly fuzzy with a blush of mouldrsquo. They would have tasted the sticky juice and become euphoric - and so wine quickly became part of religion as it seemed to connect us to the gods. The ancient Greeks and Romans deied wine in the rites of Dionysius and Bacchus - and it remains embedded in our culture today.lsquoWine is so important in society as we use it as the major part of any celebration,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoHumans are incredibly gregarious, we love celebrating and will find any reason to be together whether itrsquos a birth, christening, marriage, finishing school - we find reasons to have a celebration, and the major part of that celebration is when wersquore toasting whoever it is thatrsquos getting married or winning a race.lsquoTake that same idea across to a dinner party. It doesnrsquot matter how many people are coming, when they cross your doorstep yoursquoll give them a beer or a gin and tonic, but thatrsquos not why you invited them - the reason you invited them is that part of the evening when yoursquore all sitting around the table focused on each other and having a good time and the food comes out and yoursquoll notice all the other drinks go out the window and are replaced by wine - wine becomes the centre of the table. We change to wine as that is the celebratory part of the evening. Thatrsquos the importance of wine, itrsquos all about the occasion. Itrsquos how we celebrate.rsquoHoy has spent his le in the wine trade. Born in England, he married a Scot and the pair went to South Africa to run a vineyard. He later moved back to Scotland, where he now runs the Glasgow Wine School.The secret to winersquos beloved role in human le is its connection to food and social interaction. Sure, says Hoy, you can drink it to lsquoget pissedrsquo but therersquos much more to wine than that - unlike other drinks which exist primarily to get you drunk.Food is at the heart of every culture on earth, and wine elevates food. Wine is completely natural, like the best food - itrsquos just grape juice, yeast and sunshine. In wine, itrsquos the acidity and the tannins - the chemicals extracted from the grape skin that dry the mouth - which, when matched with a simple plate of food, can create something sublime. Other alcoholic drinks donrsquot have the same type of acidity thatrsquos found in white wine or the tannins in red wine.lsquoAcidity is a really good palate cleanseryou are eating fatty food,rsquo says Hoy. lsquoOne of the most magical food and wine parings is champagne and fish and chips.rsquo The fatty, oily fish and chips coat the inside of the mouth, and that deadens taste buds leaving the brain bored with whatrsquos being eaten. A sip of acidic champagne washes the mouth clean and the palate is ready to experience the taste of fish and chips all over again.With tannins itrsquos all about the interaction with salt - think of a hearty stew or a bowl of spaghetti bolognese, a lot of the flavour comes from the salt in the food. lsquoSalt suppresses the perception of tannins,rsquo Hoy says, lsquoand once it does that it gives the impression of the wine being more fruity. One of the things we know works really well is a nice big steak with an Argentinian Malbec [a red] - itrsquos become one of the great things in le. Malbec has a very high tannin level and when we cook steaks therersquos salt in the cooking process, so put them together and suddenly the wine becomes this juicy drink.rsquoHoyrsquos tip for matching food and wine is simple - lsquothe more flavour you have in your food, the more flavour you should have in your winersquo. He gives the example of a dinner of smoked fish with a cream sauce. lsquoThe sauce is where your fattiness will come through, so you will need a bit of acidity in your wine. If you tried to match a Sauvignon Blanc the flavours of the dish would overpower the wine as it doesnrsquot have a huge amount of flavour necessarily - butyou changed that Sauvignon Blanc into a nice wooded Chardonnay the wine will stand up to the food and still have the acidity.rsquoWith something like a green salad, though, a wooded Chardonnay would kill the delicate summery taste, but a Sauvignon Blanc is probably perfect. The worst food and wine matching, says Hoy, is red wine with dessert. The clash of sugar and tannin is frankly disgusting - so what you need is a desert wine, something like a Sauterne. lsquoThe wine you are drinking must always be sweeter than the food you are eating,rsquo says Hoy.Hoy wants to remove all the snobbery from wine. Getting the right drink to go with the right food shouldnrsquot be the domain of the middle classes - itrsquos about taste, not money, and we all have taste. Of course, many wines arenrsquot cheap, but over the years low cost wines have filled supermarkets and a half decent red or white can be picked up for the same price as a six pack of beeryou know what you are looking for, and what food will go with it.Jay McInerney, the acclaimed American novelist and wine writer, says having less money will make you a more astute wine drinker as you are lsquoforced to make choices and sacrices that can only sharpenrsquo discrimination and appreciation. lsquoStarting at the top, one will miss out on the climb,rsquo he says.McInerney makes discovering wine sound like a mysterious journey, and indeed there is something deeply mysterious about wine. The film Sideways is adored by wine drinkers as itrsquos a tragi-comic love story wrapped in a homage to the vineyard. In the film, one of characters, Maya, has a speech in which she talks about wine asitrsquos almost human. lsquoI like to think about the le of wine,rsquo she says, lsquohow itrsquos a living thing. I like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing how the sun was shiningit rained. I like to think about all the people who tended and picked the grapes. Andits an old wine, how many of them must be dead by now. I like how wine continues to evolve, likeI opened a bottle of wine today it would taste dferent thanId opened it on any other day, because a bottle of wine is actually alive. And its constantly evolving and gaining complexity. That is, until it peakshellip and then it begins its steady, inevitable decline.rsquoFor Hoy, wine is about simplicity. A winemaker in ancient Rome could make as good a wine as the wealthiest and best equipped vineyard owner today. lsquoIrsquove seen people make the most astounding wines in plastic tanks,rsquo Hoy says. lsquoIrsquove worked in some vineyards in France where the equipment was as old as the hills and I thought there was no way you can produce decent wine here, but you taste the wines and theyrsquore remarkable. The very best wines in the world are the ones where the wine-maker is working with what nature has given them - not adding or taking anything away.rsquoThose great wines are down to what the French call lsquoterroirrsquo - the land, the environment in which the grape is grown. The secret is getting the right grape for the right soil and climate. Once that sweet spot - that Goldilocks zone - has been found then nature will take her course.Of course, not everyone is in love with wine. The writer Rory Sutherland finds itrsquos the snobbery that kills. lsquoFor the drinker to demonstrate status and connoisseurship,rsquo he says, wine must become lsquoabsurdly hard to navigate, so providing opportunities for contrived, hair-splitting distinctions that let the buyer advertise his own discernment.rsquoOthers, quite rightly, worry about health effects, like Dr Susan Biali, a wine drinker whorsquos now more or less on the wagon. lsquoI love wine,rsquo she says, but she admits to an addictive personality and recalls the aggressive breast cancer her mother had in her s. When Biali heard the renowned Hard-trained gynaecologist Sara Gottfried say lsquowhat you think wine is giving you, itrsquos actually taking awayrsquo, she decided to quit. lsquoThe truth of this resonated so completely with me that it pushed me over the edge. No more wine, or alcohol, period, except on the rarest occasions like a special dinner.rsquoOthers simply hate wine because of the taste. Author Anne Fadiman is the daughter of the late, great wine critic, Clton Fadiman, but she detests Bordeauxs, Burgundys, Pinot Noirs, and Pinot Grigos. Therersquos not a wine she likes - and thatrsquos because shersquos as near as it comes to a supertaster - someone with a higher than average number of tastebuds who can be overpowered by strong flavours. lsquoAs other women fake orgasms, I have faked hundreds of satisfied responses to hundreds of glasses,rsquo she says.Luckily, for the Glasgow Wine School, supertasters are relatively few and far between - therersquos certainly none at the schoolrsquos latest wine tasting evening. Mike Cottam is leading a dozen or so people - of all ages and backgrounds - through the basics of how to get the best from a glass of wine.Each person is concentrating solely on the most sensory experience for a human outside of sex - taste. As they sip and slurp and swirl it seems asthe mouth is the very centre of their being - and perhaps it is, can you imagine how dead le would be without taste One of the tasters, Alec McLean, says wine is about simple pleasures. lsquoItrsquos about taste,rsquo he says, lsquorelaxation. Itrsquos about being slow in a busy world. Itrsquos also about story - where did the wine come from, who made it, and why. Itrsquos not mass produced, itrsquos real. Thatrsquos a rarity these days.rsquoTASTING TIPS: HOW TO DRINK WINE LIKE A CONNOISSEURIf you want a quick guide on how to taste wine, then Madeline Puckette and Justine Hammack at the company Wine Folly are your go-to connoisseurs.They say follow the four simple steps of look, smell, taste and conclude, and yoursquoll be able to navigate the complex world of wine with ease.LOOKYou can tell a lot just by how a wine looks.Tilt the glass over a white backdrop to inspect the colour. The paler the colour at the edge the younger the wine. In a white, a deep gold will be oaked. The darker the red, the higher the tannin.Swirl the wine to see how viscous it is -the wine lsquolegsrsquoare slow then the alcohol is high. Swirling also oxygenates the wine letting flavour out.SMELLHold the glass just under your nose and give it a quick snf to lsquoprimersquo your nose. Swirl, and then get your nose right in the glass and take a deep snf. Now think about what those smells remind you of - donrsquot be scared to move your nose around in the glass as rich fruit smells and more floral smells can gather in dferent places.If your nose gets lsquooverloadedrsquo snf your forearm to neutralise all those wine smells. Donrsquot wear perfume.In wine, the primary aromas are from the grapes. So a Sauvignon Blanc will smell like gooseberries or grass. Secondary aromas come from the winemaking process, and reactions with yeast and bacteria. So the buttery smell in Chardonnay comes from a type of bacteria. Tertiary aromas are from the ageing process - thatrsquos what gives Champagne its nutty flavour.TASTECoat your mouth with a large sip followed by smaller sips. Sloosh it around in your mouth and draw air in through your teeth. Try to pick out at least three fruit flavours and three other flavours. You donrsquot need to spit wine out.Think about the basic tastes of wine. Sweetness is at the front of the mouth. Acidity makes your mouth water. Tannin dries the mouth - the Wine Folly folk say itrsquos like a lsquowet teabagrsquo. Alcohol creates heat at the back of the mouth.Wine lsquoevolvesrsquo on your palate. A Syrah, for example, tastes very strong for a short period of time. A Cabernet Sauvignon builds on the palette and then fades gradually. A Pinot Noir is subtle, never overpowering the mouth and has a long finish - meaning the taste lingers over time.CONCLUDEThis is where you begin to build your expertise. Was the wine balanced  Did one flavour overpower another Think about the key traits of the wine and keep them in your memory to use when tasting other wines.Try blind tasting with friends - and see how you all react to each wine.Start with single-ietals - thatrsquos one type of grape such as a Chardonnay or a Merlot - so you can work out how each grape tastes.Try the same grape but from dferent regions - like France, Chile or New Zealand.Be honest - decide what type of wine you like, not what type of wine you are told you should like.Wine Folly use a four point rating system - from bleh, to meh, then yeah, and finally last meal, as in this is the wine yoursquod have with your last meal on earth.Drink sensibly."},{"url":null,"title":"experts-call-on-snp-government-to-back-5-child-benefit-rise-in-budget","story":"The experts issued their demand days after a new report revealed that nearly a quarter of a million children north of the border are in poverty.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard backed the call: \"Children living in poverty cannot wait several years for these additional funds - they need them now.\"Following the independence referendum, the cross-party Smith Commission led to Holyrood acquiring new powers over taxation and social security.Among the basket of powers given to MSPs was the ability to create new benefits and top-up existing programmes reserved to Westminster.The SNP Government has since confirmed it will introduce an income supplement by , although Ministers have yet to decide on what form it will take.According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, around one million Scots are in poverty, of which , are children.In two separate letters, a range of senior figures have called on the Government to bring forward their top-up plan by announcing an income boost in Wednesdayrsquos Budget.Their preferred option is to increase child benefit, which is currently set at pound. a week for the first child, by pound, in line with the high-profile lsquoGive Me Fiversquo campaign.In their letter to Mackay, four senior church figures - Church of Scotland Moderator Rt Rev Susan Brown, The Most Rev Mark Strange of the Scottish Episcopal Church, Joan Cook of the Scottish Unitarian Association, and Bishop William Nolan - wrote:ldquoThere is a compelling argument to act with greater urgency in implementing the income supplement. Given the levels of poverty that currently exist in Scotland, we urge you to consider using the budget to deliver the income supplement in the next year, rather than by the current timescale of .ldquoDoing so would reflect the great need that families across Scotland must be lted out of poverty right now, rather than in several yearsrsquo time.\"They added: ldquoAs supporters of the Give Me Five campaign, we ask that ndash as well as bringing forward the delivery of the supplement ndash you also consider doing so via topping up child benefit, which would immediately lt tens of thousands of children out of poverty.In the second letter to the Finance Secretary, over twenty prominent iniduals called for child benefit to be increased.These include Satwat Rehman at One Parent Families Scotland, Children st Chief Executive Mary Glasgow, Scottish Drugs Forum CEO David Liddell, STUC General Secretary Grahame Smith, Poverty Alliance Director Peter Kelly and Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland Director John Dickie.It also included senior figures in Cranhill Development Trust, childrenrsquos charity Aberlour, Justice and Peace Scotland, Energy Action Scotland, Close the Gap and Engender.They wrote: ldquoAs a non-means tested entitlement, it [child benefit] has a high take-up rate and is less expensive to administer, and we continue to believe that topping up child benefit would represent a most effective and impactful way of delivering the new income supplement.The signatories also stated that they are ldquoseriously concerned that the  timescale for an income top up is ldquonot reflective of the urgency with which it is required.Dickie said: ldquoThese letters demonstrate the extraordinary breadth and depth of support across Scotland for an immediate boost to family incomes to help tackle the devastating hardship too many children are facing.ldquoAlong with faith groups, trade unions and childrens charities we urge the Finance Secretary to prioritise financial support for families as a matter of urgency. A pound top up to child benefit would be one way of lting thousands of children out of poverty and protecting many more from the damage poverty wreaks.The SNP has so far resisted the policy on the grounds that the payment would benefit families not in poverty.SNP Communities Secretary Aileen Campbell said: ldquoScotland is the only part of the UK to have ambitious targets to reduce, and ultimately eradicate, child poverty. We are developing a new income supplement to provide additional financial support to families who need it most as research shows that topping up Child Benefit, which remains reserved to the UK Government, is not the most efficient or effective way to lt children out of poverty, nor would it be quick or simple.However, the Government is facingpolitical pressure to back the pound a week increase, as the Greens and Scottish Labour are in favour of the move.Leonard said: \"This is a hugely signicant intervention in the budget debate by faith leaders, charities, anti-poverty campaigns and the STUC uniting to call for Scotlands powers to be used in the interests of the many, not the few.\"Derek Mackay must listen to these church leaders, charities and Labour and raise Child Benefit by pound per week in his budget on Wednesday.\"This would lt around , children out of poverty and help families across Scotland.\"Scottish Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said: \"Topping up Child Benefit was a Green manesto proposal that would lt thousands of families out of poverty.

It will also have “black start” ability, meaning it can immediately begin producing powerthere is a sudden shutdown of supply.The two new proposed developments will be even more powerful than Red John – MW at Loch Tay and MW at Loch Awe.The three ILI schemes are part of a total .GW of new pumped storage hydro in development across the UK, all of it in Scotland except a MW scheme in Wales.There are already two pumped storage hydro plants operating north of the border – the MW Cruachan “hollow mountain”, near Dalmally in Argyll, and the MW Loch Mhòr, at Foyers in Inverness-shire.The technology has been around for more than a century but industry experts believe the modern schemes could be a game-changer in the move to green power.The main drawback of renewable energy schemes such as wind farms is intermittency of supply – they cannot generate power when the wind doesn’t blow. Conversely, turbines often need switched off when winds are strong but demand is low.Pumped storage has been hailed as the “holy grail” in the quest for energy security.“Pumped storage is still quite under-recognised,” said Mark Wilson, chief executive of ILI. “It’s just not out there – nobody has shone a torch on it. But it’s so simple. When you don’t need power, or when power’s cheap or would go to waste, you use it. “Millions of pounds a year is wasted on curtailment payments when turbines are switched off. Rather than doing that you can use the wind energy to power the water back up the hill to the top reservoir. So you are mitigating against curtailment wastages. “Then, when power is required at peak times, you just let the water go back down to the bottom reservoir – it goes through the turbines, creates energy and powers the system. That happens all day every day.“Pumped storage is completely efficient. It’s clean. It gives energy security because you’re not having to import gas from Europe. The energy is always there to be able to store it. That’s why they call it the holy grail.”Scotland’s climate and landscape make it well suited for pumped storage hydro.Fabrice Leveque, senior policy manager at industry organisation Scottish Renewables, said: “Scotland’s plentul rainfall often dampens spirits but it acts as one of the country’s best renewable energy resources, utilised by one of our most popular, well-established green energy technologies – hydro.“Scotland’s geography provides many suitable locations for large pumped storage hydro schemes so it’s excellent to see such a strong pipeline of projects on the horizon.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841384.1544295253!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli end of the line for sorry scotrail strategy","story":"It#s quite creative,self-defeating, for ScotRail to turn itself into some kind of metaphor for the Tory government#s handling of Brexit. Here we are in a state of crisis # trains cancelled, poor communication and a dearth of trained staff # and how does it behave  It tries to sht the blame while promising customers that out of chaos will emerge a strong and stable # sorry, I mean much-enhanced # service for commuters.Scotland’s railways have been failing for a long time. Google “ScotRail” and “mayhem” and there will be no shortage of hits. Whether it’s Storm Ali or engineering works or a lack of locomotives, the company always seems to have an excuse – and an alternative bus service – for passengers stranded in the middle of nowhere.It would be a rare and lucky traveller who has never had cause to moan about some aspect of their rail journey . The experience is frequently blighted by overcrowding, delays, poor wi-fi and, most particularly, a lack of forward-planning that means every summer the Edinburgh Festival seems to take the company by surprise. Most mornings, Twitter is full of complaints logged under the hashtag #ScotFail and though those who man ScotRail’s account are adept at defusing anger, they can’t mask the overall impression of inadequacy.When Humza Yousaf was Transport Secretary it seemed asthings could only get better yet under Michael Matheson, they have got worse. In October, the company was fined £, for failing to meet required standards for station toilets, ticket machines, train seats, train toilets and cleanliness. And a few weeks ago, ScotRail Alliancerecorded its worst punctuality figures in  years.Like Theresa May, all ScotRail’s underlying problems seemed to come to a head last week when it lost any semblance of control over the service it is paid to deliver. Every day, dozens of trains were being cancelled with little warning, leaving commuters unable to get to and from work. Packed to overflowing, Glasgow’s Queen Street station was transformed into a page from Where’s Wally  The Fe Circle became the Fth Circle of Hell.ScotRail fell back on the “jam tomorrow” defence. It said its problems had been exacerbated by staff training being carried in advance of timetable changes that would usher in a brave new world later today. Coming hot on the heels of a price hike announcement, this promise of a shiny, happy future was met, not with cheering and the waving of flags, but by the kind of incredulous expression Carolyn Wilson, director of the Foreign Office recently wore as Boris Johnson flaunted his ignorance in advance of a meeting with their counterparts in France.It is true, of course, that not every aspect of the ongoing debacle is ScotRail’s fault. Often the delays are caused by signalling or track problems, both of which are Network Rail’s responsibility. The company has also been plagued by issues with suppliers, such as the late delivery of the new Hitachi trains which are supposed to cut the journey times between Glasgow and Edinburgh and the refurbishment of  old InterCity trains, the first  of which start running today. Three of the Hitachi trains were withdrawn from service for a short period almost immediately after they were introduced because of faults with the brake control system and the “refurbished” InterCity trains have been left with old-fashioned slam-doors and toilets which flush directly on to the track.Recent delays have been exacerbated by a row over pay and conditions which saw drivers refusing to work overtime . Then again, neither the company nor the government has done much to alleviate passengers’ travails or instil consumer confidence that the situation is likely to improve. ScotRail often seems downright blasé about the resentment building up among frequent travellers whose lives are affected by its unreliability.Indeed it chose last week, when it was barely operating a service at all, to announce that its popular Kids Go Free promotion – which allows adults to take up to two children for free injourneys – was being scrapped. Instead children will be charged a flat rate of £, which seems at odds with trying to get more people off the roads.As for the Scottish government: when it gave Dutch state-owned company Abellio the -year contract to run the franchise back in , it described the deal as “world-leading”. Having set the parameters for the £ billion contract – it cannot shrug off all responsibility.As far back as , petitions were already being raised against the company. Yet the SNP has bent over backwards to defend Abellio ScotRail in the face of its poor performance. After the release of the latest dreadful punctuality figures, Matheson agreed to waive the operator’s performance benchmarks until June , a move the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association described as a “carte blanche to fail”. This despite the fact that in   it received £min direct government funding, and the SNP has the right to end the contract at the halfway pointit is not meeting a high enough standard.Much hangs on what happens today. If the new timetables are rolled out smoothly then perhaps the company will have bought itself a reprieve. But– as seems more likely – the service continues to be beset by delays and glitches, then there must be action.Scottish Labour has called for a freeze on fares in this week’s budget. While this would be justied and might focus minds, it is dficult to see how it would resolve broader problems with the service.A better solution – also backed by Scottish Labour – might be to bring the franchise back into the public sector . According to one report by think tank Common Weal, allowing operating profits to be reinvested could produce a better service and create a lower, fairer fare regime. But fixing the system depends on Network Rail raising its game too thus, pushing for the devolution of responsibilities for the development, design and delivery of Scottish infrastructure projects to Holyrood must be a priority.If the SNP wants to tout the country’s rail service as world-leading, then it really has to get a firm grip on the companies delivering it.

Rather, it is the last refuge of the charlatan.When a politician says their words have been taken out of context, what they mean is they realise their words show them up to be the terrible person they are. These people never offer the correct “context” for their words because they are bullshitting. Their words were always taken perfectly in context.Which brings me neatly to former Secretary of State for International Development, Priti Patel, the latest unspeakable toerag to drop the context bomb.It emerged on Friday that Patel, a Brexiteer of the killer robot iety, had suggested the possibility of food shortages in Ireland following a no deal departure from the EU should have been used as leverage to encourage the Irish government to drop support for a backstop plan.Given the often dark history between Britain and Ireland, the very idea that our government might effectively threaten their Dublin counterparts with food shortages is especially nauseating. It’s a suggestion that reveals a uniquely unpalatable blend of cynicism and insensitivity. And there is no context in which this would not be so.Later on Friday, Patel tweeted: “It is clear my comments on ‘No Deal’ have been taken out of context by some. We should go back to Brussels  get a better deal. There is still time. Let’s take back control of borders, laws  money.”Anyone wondering in what context these remarks should have been seen was to be left guessing by Patel, who offered no clarication. Instead, she indulged the fantasy of the grters and spivs behind the Leave campaign that the EU would offer the UK a more beneficial dealonly the UK would demand it.This supremely arrogant notion, the idea that a puffed-up little UK – a UK made smaller still by their actions – could dictate termsonly more of us “believed” in Brexit, remains popular with hardcore Eurosceptics.Patel and her fellow travellers – failed former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the ludicrous back-bencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, for example – sustain themselves with a fantasy that the draft agreement struck between Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU could have been made stronger through the power of self-belief.It was always the case that the UK was going to be at a disadvantage in Brexit negotiations. We never had cards worth playing. The EU – as is its duty – has moved forward in such a way that the unique benefits of membership are protected. The very idea that we would be afforded some of those benefits from the outside was always a nonsense and no amount of interventions of the “we should have demanded more” iety can change that.Whenever the downside of their case was pointed out in the run-up to the  vote, Brexiteers parroted the line, favoured by Alex Salmond and those he led in the  Scottish independence referendum campaign, that such claims were a strategy of “project fear”. It didn’t matter how compelling the evidence, any suggestion that leaving the EU might not be entirely painless was grandly dismissed. It wasn’t that their case was flawed, it was that their opponents wished to terry the people with a campaign of lies.This project fear garbage continues, even as the EU – through the limited agreement it is willing to strike – shows us that many of the warnings given have turned out to be quite correct.May presses on, trying to build support in Westminster for a deal that will satisfy neither the hardline Eurosceptic Little Englanders of Brexit nor the majority of MPs who backed Remain in .The arrogance of Brexiteers who think the UK can, as Boris Johnson once said, have cake and eat cake has echoes in the position adopted by a cross-party group of MPs that the UK should leave the EU but join Norway in a free trade area inside the European single market.You’ll simply never guess – it turns out that the UK is in no position to demand that, either.Senior political and business figures in Norway have made that abundantly clear.The so-called Norway-plus plan, which would require the UK to seek to join the European Free Trade Area group, consisting of Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, is already dead.On Friday, Heidi Nordby Lunde, an MP in Norway’s governing Conservative party, and leader of Norway’s European movement, was refreshingly blunt.“Really,’ she said, “the Norwegian option is not an option. We have been telling you this for one and a half years since the referendum… so I am surprised that after all these years it is still part of the grown-up debate in the UK.”Nordby Lunde added: “You just expect us to give you an invitation rather than consider whether Norway would want to give you such an invitation. It might be in your interest to use our agreement, but it would not be in our interest.”All of the alternatives to the PM’s draft deal being suggested by senior politicians are non-starters because, simply, they would require other nations to weaken their own positions.That’s not to say that May’s plan holds much appeal. It is simply the case that it really is the only deal on the table. Anyone who suggests otherwise is \u2028using the “project total bullshit” playbook.No amount of bluff and bluster, whether it’s the suggestion we should demand the Norwegians let us into their club or the horric idea that we should threaten Ireland with the prospect of food shortages, can change the fact that Brexiteers’ greatest achievement is the humiliating diminishment of the United Kingdom.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841198.1544219408!/image/image.jpg","title":"sleep in the park to finish as founder vows to return with new event","story":"Social Bite founder Josh Littlejohn has revealed he is to wind up his #Sleep in the Park# event after just two years # as it emerged that the nationwide fundraisers will fall short of official targets.He admitted it had proved more dficult than he expected to persuade people to sleep out overnight to raise awareness of homelessness.But the award-winning social entrepreneur said he was already working on ideas for a “new and dferent” event to launch next year.: Nicola Sturgeon slams UK Government over fees paid by EU citizens in public sectorMore than , people who braved sub-zero temperatures in Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh last year raised more than £ million for several initiatives aimed at tacking homelessness.Mr Littlejohn said nearly , people will be raising around £.m at mass sleep-outs in Edinburgh, Dundee, Glasgow and Aberdeen today. But he admitted planning this year’s event, which will see Scottish singing stars KT Tunstall and Amy MacDonald travel by helicopter to perform in all four locations, had involved “four times the work” than last year’s fundraiser. : Fiona Bruce unveiled as new BBC Question Time presenterMr Littlejohn, who has won the backing of George Clooney, Leonardo di Caprio and Prince Harry for his Social Bite chain of sandwich shops and cafes, said he was “relieved” so many people had signed up to take part in the second Sleep in the Park event. All participants must pledge to raise at least £ to secure a place at the event, with corporate teams being asked to pay a minimum of £,. The top fundraisers receive a personalised Christmas hamper from Nicola Sturgeon and the chance to meet Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai at a gala Sleep Out “thank you” dinner in March.When the expanded event was announced in the summer, Mr Littlejohn said he had hoped to sign up , people and raise at least £m as part of a drive to “eradicate” homelessness in Scotland within five years.Mr Littlejohn said: “It’s a really dficult event to do two years in a row. A lot of people who did it last year viewed it as a once in a letime experience. It is a lot of effort for people to raise money from their friends and families, and everything  that is entailed with it.“I’m really delighted to get to the level of participation and fundraising that we have. “It could have gone the other way. We could have really struggled. I’m relieved and very grateful to everyone that has signed up and got behind it.”Around , people will take part in the Edinburgh event, which will be staged in Princes Street Gardens again, where Lulu, Admiral Fallow, Siobhan Wilson and Martha Ffion will be performing.Frightened Rabbit will perform for the first time since the death of frontman Scott Hutchison in May when they headline the Sleep in the Park event in Glasgow, which The Twilight Sad, Kathryn Joseph and another “surprise act” will also be appearing at.Kyle Falconer, Fatherson, Hunter  The Bear and Withered Hand will perform for about , participants in Dundee.A total of , people have signed up to sleep out in Duthie Park in Aberdeen, where Eddie Reader, Kris Drever and the Nevis Ensemble will be providing the musical entertainment.Mr Littlejohn added: “It’s definitely been more of a challenge this year but it was definitely the right thing to do to spread it geographically. “If we’d just done it in Edinburgh we’d have got a signicant reduction in participation.“We’ve not just done another event for the sake of it. We had a target to raise £.m this year to put towards our ‘Housing First’ programme to lt more than  rough sleepers out of homelessness across Scotland.“It will definitely be a dferent kind of event next year. I do have an idea I am working on at the moment. It won’t be the same kind of thing.”Littlejohn first came to prominence six years ago when he and business partner Alice Thompson launched the first Social Bite sandwich and coffee shop to help create jobs for homeless people.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh #  she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27508  ","story":" Síle DarraghWhen young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this state, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1295009.jpg--.jpg?1544181922000\n","title":"new york concert date for kells flautist","story":"A Kells teenager has been selected to join the prestigious National Youth Orchestra.Jake Houston has been playing the flute for eight years and is set to take his place in the world’s greatest orchestra of teenagers in December.The -year-old will join  other teenagers from all over the country as part of the Youth Orchestra, which is also planning its first ever tour to the USA in .The members of the orchestra were selected following  days of auditions held in  cities across the country.

A recent survey of RCGP NImembers found that % of GPs surveyed are concerned their increased workload during the winter months will negatively affect their ability to deliver patient care. The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

This puts the whole of the United Kingdom in prime position to seize new opportunities as we leave the EU.As we establish our new relationship with Europe, the Industrial Strategy will help us to build the foundations behind our withdrawal agreement. Our prosperity and ability to build a strong economy is dependent on how we encourage innovation, develop high quality jobs and skills, and support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Northern Ireland has a world-leading reputation in key sectors, including construction and automotive, as well as future industries such as Articial Intelligence , cyber security and le sciences.The Industrial Strategy has led to specic partnerships between the government and these industries, which will help these major employers in Northern Ireland face the future outside the EU with confidence.Today I am pleased to announce, with the Business Secretary Greg Clark, £, of funding from the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund for the County Antrim-based le sciences company Randox. This will pay for the research and development of cutting-edge technology to enable diagnostic tools to be manufactured more quickly and effectively.Eventually, this will lead to more manufacturing jobs as a result.Northern Ireland is also benefiting from UK-wide funding programmes under the Industrial Strategy, including Armagh City, Banbridge  Craigavon who have successfully bid for £.m and Belfast for £.m as some of the  areas benefiting from the £m Full Fibre Networks Challenge fund, designed to increase connectivity across the UK.The UK has a strong economy, with eight straight years of economic growth, over  million more people in jobs, and higher employment and lower unemployment in every region and nation of the UK - we should be proud of this.We are open and enterprising, founded on invention, innovation and competition.In Northern Ireland, employment levels are almost at a record high, and the UK government is determined to build on this progress.We are at the forefront of scientic invention because we embrace change and use regulation to stimulate an environment for creativity.We have globally admired universities and research institutions, such as Queens and Ulster University, because we have nurtured our intellectual powerhouses with public investment. And we have a deserved reputation for being a dependable and confident place to do business because we have high standards, clear regulation and great partnerships.The UKs businesses can take on the world because they have access to a skilled workforce and modern infrastructure, and Northern Ireland is an important and growing part of that. The Prime Minister, the rest of our Cabinet colleagues and I will continue working to secure the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK.At the same time we are delivering our long-term plan to support businesses throughout the UK to thrive and grow.Building on the great strides the Industrial Strategy has already taken so that after we leave the EU, our businesses and institutions are in the best possible position to build on our strengths and lead the world.Karen Bradley MP is Secretary of State for Northern Ireland"},{"url":null,"title":"suzanne breen unionists united in opposition as remainers rally around backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"huge boost for city centre as primark gets ready to open its doors again","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.Writing in the Sunday , Mr Quince said: “I do not want to be explaining to my constituents why

Government is defeated.“If it doesn’t get through, anything could happen – People’s Vote, Norway-plus, any of these options could come forward and none of them are as good as the current arrangement we have got with the Withdrawal Agreement to vote on on Tuesday.”Her comments could be viewed as an attempt to win over Brexiteers who might prefer Mrs May’s deal, even with its controversial Northern Irish backstop, to a Norway-plus future inside both the single market and customs union or the possibility of another referendum reversing the  vote.“A lot of people have a perfect vision of what they think Brexit should look like, and that ‘perfect’ is not available,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today.“What we need is a compromise deal, that’s what the Prime Minister has proposed and I would urge my colleagues to think about, first of all, why people voted to leave the European Union, what their interpretation is of that and secondly, what the alternatives are.Work and Pensions Secretary Amber

her Cabinet deciding to “brazen it out”, saying such an approach would be a “disaster”.He told the Daily : “I believe thatthe response is, ‘we’ve lost but we will do this all over again’, it will

the aftermath of a defeat.“What would be a complete mistake would be to allow what is already an unstable period to descend into further instability with talk of a leadership change,” she said.The Cabinet minister also appeared to endorse an amendment to the Government’s motion for the vote on Tuesday tabled by former Northern Ireland minister Sir Hugo Swire in an attempt to win over wavering Eurosceptics.The alteration would mean Parliament would have to approve a decision to trigger the backstop arrangement, put a one-year time limit on it and seek assurances from the EU that the backstop would be temporary.Ms Rudd told Today: “Hugo Swire has put an amendment down which I hope will give some of my colleagues reassurance over the so-called backstop.”Former Conservative leader

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped.https:www.belfasttelegraph news politics nigel-dodds-prime-minister-must-bin-the-backstop-and-work-for-a-better-deal-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland article.ece cd AUTOCROP h --_new__I.JPGEmailDecember is the month associated with gts, and it is clear from the Attorney Generals legal advice that the Prime Minister is prepared to gt our sovereignty to Brussels. Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"royal job adverts among the most clickedon linkedin reveals","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

To work so hard to organise this event and support fellow kidney patients is magnicent.ldquoAll their hard work and attention to detail certainly paid off and it was wonderful to be with them on the day to help out and see this couples infectious enthusiasm in action.ldquoOn behalf of Kidney Care UK I thank them for their hard work and efforts to rally so many people to support a cause which touches the lives of so many.Thanking Stephen and Christine on behalf of Northern Ireland Kidney Patients Association, William Johnston said: ldquoIt was lovely to get the chance to join with Stephen and Christine in the beautul setting of Castle Ward and to see their enthusiasm for supporting our cause and delivering and Organ Donation message of hope.ldquoI want to say a special word of thanks to them for really pulling out the stops to put together an amazing event to help local kidney patients and their families..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaign to clamp down on dog fouling  ","story":"LOCAL council officials have unveiled a new campaign aimed at helping rid the district of its dog fouling problem.It is a particularly contentious issue and one of the single most complained about problems in the area and, despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed and there is virtually no town or village not affected by it.This week, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has launched a new awareness campaign to remind dog owners about the importance of cleaning up after their dogs.Rolled out after a survey by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul found that levels of dog fouling had increased from the previous year, the local authority is determined to get a grip on the issue.One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.While the mindset of these particular iniduals is hard to fathom and it is concerning that they are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind, council officials hope the new campaign can change minds.Dog owners are being reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so is leaving them open to an pound fine.In addition, dog owners are reminded that they are responsible for training their dogs properly to lsquodo their businessrsquo in their ownerrsquos garden where it can then be collected and placed in a black bin.Politicians have become increasingly frustrated at the blatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.There are a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district and council officials are prepared to do all they can to tackle the problem. Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery. However, thanks to the initial care of the HEMS team, the work of the Belfast Trust and follow-up surgery, Damienrsquos arm has been saved.ldquoIt has been a long journey to recovery so far, but I have been making great progress and exceeding the expectations of my medical team, Damien confirmed.ldquoEvery week there is further improvement and we are now hopeful that I will gain % mobility in my arm. I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event. We were thrilled to be able to present this to the charity.Shirley Gilliland, who owns the Carryduff firm along with her husband John added: ldquoDamien has been part of the company for over four years and as a close team we were all gutted when the accident happened.ldquoThe speed of the response of the air ambulance and the critical interventions at the scene have clearly made a dference in Damienrsquos recovery. Wersquore so grateful to have him back on the team and doing well.ldquoWhilst you take every precaution accidents can happen and we are now very much aware of the role that the air ambulance has to play in the local community, including the impact for industry related accidents.ldquoI would urge other companies to do what they can to support the service whether that is by corporate donation or fundraising..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great grandmother’s pens new children’s novel  ","story":"A CLOUGH woman has just published her third childrenrsquos book in a series cleverly written to capture the imagination of young readers.Eighty six year-old Maureen Donnellyrsquoa book, Five Famous Dogs of Ireland, which is illustrated by Ulster artist Susan Hughes, looks at the wealth of legends and rich folklore which has almost been forgotten today.Mrs Donnelly, whose late husband, the Rev James Donnelly, was rector of Saul and Inch Parish Churches, says she got her inspiration from a picture of her great grandson, one year-old Rory Donnelly, holding on to a fluffy teddy bear in one hand and patting the familyrsquos pet dog with the other.She said: ldquoIt struck me when I saw the photo how well children and animals get along.

His wolfhound was called Bawn and was known to be the best jumping dog in all of Ireland and could scare off the meanest of enemies.Mrs Donnelly said: ldquoI had the privilege to grow up with stories such as Bran. I loved the story so much I wrote it down back then. And Irsquom really glad I did. I came to write all the ones I could recall back then too. These tales will be sure to ignite again the imaginations of every child who reads them.No book would be complete without the tale of Setanta, the young boy who grew up to be a brave warrior. He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation. So much of our heritage and culture is being lost on our young generation.ldquoThis series of books is a way for me to rescue those stories.

He doesnrsquot hog the limelight ndash in fact quite the opposite. He stays away from it. His hero status is earned, though, his earning of the status is not a deliberate focus. That is more for others to do. If we donrsquot have heroes then where do we get our inspirations from  Often our heroes are close to home, and that is true of this one.Itrsquos early summer  and an eager  year-old is anxious to know. ldquoWell, was he there  The equally eager  year-old, deciding to be a wee bit cute, replied: ldquoWho  A few playful expletives from the  year-old and the  year-old burst out laughing: ldquoAye, he was there ndash there was no county training tonight.:It was the first Town senior training session the  year-old attended. Dferent times. A  year-old nowadays would be a ball-boy at training. ldquoDid he train or was he ndash like ndash just there standing about not involved as he was on the county team A few expletives from medeclared: ldquoOf course he trained ndash hersquos Arkle the county captain, midfielder for The Town. ldquoDid he pass the ball to you and by the way hersquos a Fontenoy , the nineteen year-old declared robustly.ldquoYes he did I replied excitedly. The Town man gave me great encouragement and told me to keep coming back to training. He is our hero. Hersquos everyonersquos hero. I will come back to our nineteen-year old later.Over  Gaels from Down, all over Ireland and beyond gathered in the Slieve Donard Hotel last Friday night to honour and to pay tribute to one of Downrsquos greatest ever footballers, none other than the great Colm McAlarney.His evening started with a knock on the door at his home in the Town when club chairman, Kevin Sweeney, and event organiser Kevan Owens surprised Colm in his kitchen with those immortal words ldquotonight Colm ndash this is your le.It was filmed and the first sign of his hero status became apparent ndash total shock and his humble disbelief. Then came his sudden realisation of what the meaning of the word lsquoOmertarsquo was ndash the code of silence.He didnrsquot see it coming or expect it. Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9006321.jpg","title":"dont snooze on these great black friday mattress deals","story":"While having a consistent bedtime routine, avoiding screens in the run up to settling down for the night and creating a clam and relaxing atmosphere are all important to getting quality shut eye, mattresses*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

Brandon Lewis said that there were a number of hurdles before the backstop could come in, andit did it would not be permanent.Mr Lewis, who is minister without portfolio, and also chairman of the Conservative Party, was speaking to the News Letter on a visit to Dale Farm, in north Belfast.We asked him about the criticism of the Withdrawal Agreement that it had, in effect, created a situation in which Northern Ireland would never be able to leave the European Union customs or regulatory zones “There is a lot of focus on the backstop but the reality is that before the backstop we’ve got an implementation period in which to secure that future trade agreement,” he said, “so it has already been clearly fleshed out in that political declaration,” “I know people say, why can’t we get the deal finalised at the same time as the Withdrawal Agreement, but the way that the structure of EU law works you can’t do that in the EU, you have to negotiate it as a third party, so that has to come after March  .”Mr Lewis added: “The outline of the political declaration shows that we have got that in principle agreement about what we want that future agreement to be, and we’ve got that period of  months roughly to negotiate that by the end of . “If by the end of  we are not actually quite there, that could be for a range of reasons, ... the logical thing that the parties are more likely to look at is extending the implementation period, which is one of the options within the agreement for one to two years at most.“You’ve also got the option eventhat doesn’t work that you can have alternative arrangements which, with a few years between, there’s lots of things that can develop, particularly technology wise that solve that, before you even get to the backstop.”Mr Lewis said that people sometimes forget that the backstop “is hugely against what the EU would ever want to come in, because from their point of view gives us tarf free access to the customs union market with no payments, no fishing rights, no free movement, which is for them I think quite dficult in terms of the four principles”.He added “I simply don’t believe it is likely we will end up in that position. Evenwe do end up in a backstop the reality is that it has to be temporary, that is how Article  is structured.”Asked , given that this sequencing gave the EU a powerful negotiating position, it might be better to leave without a deal and then negotiate as a third party without any prior pledges, he replied: “No, absolutely not, for two reasons.“I don’t believe that the potential of the backstop is something the EU would want and is in their interest because as I say, from the EU’s point of view ... I don’t accept that there is any reason for the EU to want the backstop at all, let alone to want it for any period of time.”Sylvia Hermon: businesses and farmers are right to back PM’s Brexit deal Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Lewis added: “To the other side of your question, which is the idea of no deal, no I don’t, having just spent an hour or so, just before I came in here with businesses, that the Institute of Directors have arranged, anybody who talks to businesses actually across the UK but particularly here in Northern Ireland, it doesn’t take very long to realise why no deal is not a good option for the UK and why business doesn’t want no deal because just in time products for agri foods, it is hugely potentially hugely damaging for the job opportunities, and actually job numbers across the country.”Mr Lewis was askedhis Conservative Party was disintegrating in front of his eyes with bitter isions over Brexit.He replied: “No our membership is increasing, we are increasing our professional campaigning machine, we had a very good set of local elections this year, we had a good conference.“I am planning for , councillors getting elected next May of which two thirds roughly we are defending, and the party machine is in good health in that way and I want to continue to see that improve and grow.”• News Letter grills Theresa May on backstop• Ben Lowry on Brexit and the coming week• Jim Nicholson: MPs can still get a better deal• David Lidington: Tory pact with DUP still going JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8732434.1544190778!/image/image.jpg","title":"education","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Education   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Education Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Education       Northern Irelands first fully interactive safety educational centre.General view of the facility.

MPs have the weight of that responsibility on their shoulders, and no MP takes that responsibility lightly.In extraordinarily dficult circumstances, where just over half the country voted Leave, I think the Prime Minister has shown her determination to respect the outcome of the EU referendum, while simultaneously protecting jobs, minimising the damage to our economy and avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. As a committed unionist, Theresa May has also ensured that both the constitutional guarantee for Northern Ireland and the consent principle of the Belfast Agreement are reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement and the Political Declaration, and they will be again when a final deal is struck on the future relationship between the UK and the EU.So, Northern Ireland’s constitutional status within the United Kingdom continues to be in our own hands. And as unionists we will determine our future with confidence, not with fear. As for the so-called “backstop”, it would apply , and only , at the end of the transition period on st December , the UK and the EU have failed to agree their future trading relationship. However, the British Government and the EU have been very clear they do not want to see any backstop coming into operation.As the Attorney General has explained, the backstop,we were ever to be in it, would be ‘as much an instrument of pain to the European Union as it would be to the United Kingdom.’ So, there are major incentives for both sides to negotiate a good future trading relationship for the entire UK, thereby avoiding the need for the backstop. I have been particularly struck by the number of businesses in Northern Ireland, farmers, community leaders and fishermen who have said they believe Theresa May’s Brexit deal is a good one for Northern Ireland. Can they all be wrong  Of course, not. I believe they have got it absolutely right. And in supporting the Prime Minister’s deal, they are taking a pragmatic approach, not a political one. If MPs vote down the deal next Tuesday, we risk crashing out of the EU on th March  and that would be a disaster for jobs and for our economy. It could also impact on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland within the UK, because a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard border on the island of Ireland.Sinn Fein would inevitably exploit a hard border for political gain with increased demands for a border poll every time we have an election. I have no intention whatsoever of gting Sinn Fein that opportunity. Last, but not least, it is worth looking at the tactics of the Labour Party. Labour repeatedly says it will not support May’s deal. They want to sink Theresa May, her deal and the government in order to precipitate a General Election where they expect to see Jeremy Corbyn ed as Prime Minister.Having Corbyn as Prime Minister would be an unmitigated disaster for Britain, for Northern Ireland and, more particularly, for unionism and I am not prepared to take that risk, evenothers are. Although the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is not perfect, I will vote to support her efforts to achieve the best deal for the whole of the United Kingdom, one which protects jobs in Northern Ireland and also protects Northern Ireland’s constitutional status and the consent principle as guaranteed by the Belfast Agreement.We Christians are vanishing from the Middle East – what will become of it without us  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"•Lady Sylvia Hermon has been MPfor North Down since JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8733462.1544305198!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      Tory chair visits Belfast, where he insists Irish border backstop is only temporary Brexit measureThe Irish border backstop can only be temporary, a senior government minister said yesterday on a visit to Northern Ireland.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come. Don’t think you know everything, as each day you’ll learn something new.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/k11.jpg","title":"kainos sees profits and sales surge","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT firm Kainos has seen a sales and profits surge with revenue rising by % to £.m for the first half of the year. And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre. The family-owned firm is taking on an empty unit at the front of Queen’s Arcade at Donegall Place. It already has its flagship store at the arcade. It comes as the company has unveiled a new Rolex workshop at its Belfast base, which means it can carry out servicing of the watches in-house. Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.
