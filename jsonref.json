The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

As became tradition, her name was chosen by viewers.Goldie was the first in a long line of Golden Retrievers to appear on the show, including one of her puppies, Bonnie, who joined in 1986.The new mother left the show shortly after giving birth, and went to live with Groom on his Derbyshire farm.Bonnie then took up the mantle - and appeared with 16 different presenters on 1,150 editions of Blue Peter.The show\u0027s second Border Collie, Mabel, joined the show when she was just six months old in 1996, after being rescued by the RSPCA in south London.She became the longest serving pet since Petra, and was recognisable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears.Mabel frequented the show alongside Lucy, a pedigree Golden Retriever who joined in 1998.Both Mabel and Lucy passed away within a month of each other in 2011, having served on the show for 14 and 12 years respectively.

Barney was the show\u0027s ninth dog - a former stray given to Helen Skelton by the Dogs Trust.The playful pup was said to receive just as much fan mail as Skelton, and he left the show with his owner in 2013.

It\u0027s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western plains region since then,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech at Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park.  \u0027Coming here brings back memories of 2003 when I spent some time on a small 16,000 hectare property in Roma in Queensland chasing cows through the bush... and it was great - I perfected the great Aussie salute.\u0027The greatest part about visiting country Australia is the people. You are the salt to of the earth: honest, hardworking and as tough as they come. That resilience, sense of humour and commitment to the land are what make you unique.\u0027You are the backbone of this country.\u0027 To laughter from the crowd, the drenched prince said: \u0027Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.\u0027You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.\u0027Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, in reference to the devastating drought.\u0027It must be hard not to lose hope when you endure so many dry months knowing you are powerless to do anything about it,\u0027 the Duke of Sussex said.\u0027The rich traditions of the Australian outback are legendary. You have a lot to be proud of. But I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.\u0027And despite welcome rain it\u0027s going to take a lot more and a long time to recover. \u0027People in many farming communities generally don\u0027t feed themselves before they need, they are often more isolated, social networks are smaller and there is still a stigma surrounding mental health.

You are one huge community and with that comes an unparalleled level of internal support and understanding.   \u0027All you need to do is ask for it... chances are they may well be suffering too, and will relish the opportunity to either listen or talk themselves. You need to know a part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it. You must not silently suffer.\u0027If I may speak personally, we are all in this together, because asking for help was one of the best decisions that I ever made.

Prince Harry was wearing a grey-blue shirt and trousers. Also in the line-up was Troy Grant MP, the member for Dubbo and minister for police and emergency services, and his wife Toni.Previous royal visitors to Dubbo have included Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1920, the Queen in 1954 and 1992 and Prince Edward in 2006.   The farming region got barely any rain through the winter and has been blighted by temperatures in excess of 45C leading to the death of thousands of cattle, loss of livelihood and severe food shortages. Some areas have experienced the driest spell since records began in 1900. Prince Harry and Meghan  visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service after their arrival to learn more about the life-saving role the aviation service provides for people living in remote areas.   There, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex met a hero medic who pulled three survivors from a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceMarcus Wilson, 47, an ex-soldier who was running a medical service at the time, was awarded Australia\u0027s Bravery Medal for his actions. Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsWounded bodies on the ground after blast in Crimea kills tenSaudi investigators arrive at consul\u0027s residence in TurkeyTheresa May lays out details of \u0027temporary backstop\u0027 Brexit dealStudents outside Crimea school during shooting that killed 18Prince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceSaudi and Turkish investigators arrive to search consulateBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40The couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance \u0027is going straight to the pool room\u0027.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

Prince Harry takes Meghan (and his Akubra) to rural Australia – 15 years after he spent his gap year working on a remote stationBy Kylie Stevens for Daily Mail Australia Prince Harry and The Duchess of Sussex have touched down for some fresh country air in rural Australia, bringing their Akubras with them to fit in with the locals.But the prince is no stranger to donning the iconic Australian hat.Their whirlwind visit to Dubbo in central New South Wales on Wednesday brings back vivid memories Prince Harry has of his time in country Australia 15 years ago.          Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.          Prince Harry looked very much the seasoned stockman during his three month stint as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station in 2003          It\u0027s understood Prince Harry earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax\u0027I have had a great time working out here, meeting people and learning a bit about how to be a jackaroo,\u0027 Prince Harry said in a statement at the time.\u0027And of course the rugby was absolutely fantastic. It\u0027s a great country.\u0027One major downside to the working holiday was the lack of privacy and being under frequent public scrutiny with media crews permanently camped outside the station.There were reports the prince contemplated cutting short his three-month Australian adventure as a result.\u0027Learning about the farm and the jackaroo trade, that\u0027s what he wants to do, not dodge the cameras,\u0027 Prince Charles\u0027 press secretary Colleen Harris said at the time.Lib McEwan, wife of Injune Hotel licensee John McEwan added: \u0027I think our locals are starting to get a bit defensive because they\u0027re feeling sorry for him. The media is spoiling the whole deal that was supposed to happen.\u0027          Prince Harry developed a strong bond with Guardsman during his time on the station          Prince Harry was just 19 when he worked on an Australian outback cattle station for Annie and Noel Hill, friends of his late mother Princess Diana"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/07/515A863100000578-6280587-A_glowing_Meghan_Markle_has_been_pictured_fawning_over_an_adorab-a-84_1539671975653.jpg","title":"What Prince Harry said met adorable baby reception Sydney Meghan Markle","story":"    Australian singer Missy Higgins has described Meghan Markle as a \u0027sweetheart\u0027 and added Prince Harry \u0027was gorgeous too, a real charmer\u0027 after the couple fawned over her baby daughter Luna at a reception in Sydney on Tuesday           A glowing Meghan admired Ms Higgins\u0027 adorable baby, telling the songtress she and Prince Harry were \u0027excited to join the club\u0027\u0027What an honour to meet the beautiful Duchess today,\u0027 Ms Higgins posted on Instagram on Tuesday alongside two photos of her cradling her daughter and meeting Meghan.  \u0027She was such a sweetheart.

Equinoxes are when the day and night are equal in length, meaning that the whole planet will get 12 hours of lightness and darkness on an equinox.The term equinox comes from the Latin ‘equi’, which means equal, and ‘nox’, which means night.Spring is set according to the date of the spring equinox, which falls on March 20, 2019, with the season ending on the day of the summer solstice, June 21.The summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, where the Northern Hemisphere gets the most amount of sunlight in the year.Because equinoxes and solstices are related to the Earth’s tilted axis and orbit around the sun, they are not fixed.Therefore, the spring equinox can fall at any point around March 20 and March 21, thus explaining why the first day of spring 2019 will not be the same as the first day of Spring in 2007 (March 21).Dancing With the Stars 2018 spoilers: Who will be the winner?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Tuesday, October 16Pink Tour 2019: Beautiful Trauma dates, tickets and more detailsBTS: Weird conspiracy theories about the K-pop groupFortnite solo tournament: All you need to knowLady Gaga engaged: All you need to know about her fiance Christian CarinoHow to watch the NBA in the UKWill Pippa Middleton\u0027s baby boy get a Royal title?Pippa Middleton baby: Name, weight, pictures, Royal title and moreAnt McPartlin and Lisa Armstrong orce: Former couple\u0026#8217s relationship timelineWorld Food Day: All you need to knowChance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits music"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/21/4F49D7DD00000578-0-image-a-5_1535574178136.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle pregnant Royal baby traditions Duchess follow","story":"    Now that Meghan Markle is pregnant, she\u0027ll have to follow Royal protocol that dictates where she gives birth, who learns of her child\u0027s arrival first and more          Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced that they\u0027re expecting a child together on MondayMost Royals have about six GodparentsRoyal children generally have about six godparents.

The royals climbed aboard a water transfer - Admiral Hudson flying the White ensign of the Royal Australian Navy - after the visit to Taronga Zoo for a 20 minute crossing of the harbour to the Sydney Opera house          After their zoo visit, the couple strolled down a walkway towards Sydney Harbour to take a boat towards from the Man O\u0027War Steps, the landing point for British and Australian fleets for 150 years            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped out in Australia today for the first day of engagements during their tour - which coincided with Meghan announcing she was pregnant. Meghan was seen wearing Diana\u0027s butterfly earrings and bracelet as she and Harry made their way down to the Man O\u0027War steps to take a boat across Sydney Harbour          Meghan and Harry chat as they watch the modern dance inside the Sydney Opera House on the first full day of their Aussie tour          The royal couple watched a rehearsal at the Sydney Opera House of Spirit 2018 by the Bangarra Dance Theatre, an internationally acclaimed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander modern dance company          Bangarra tour their dance shows across Australia and have also performed in London and New York    Overjoyed: Meghan arriving in Sydney yesterday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced todayPrince Harry is ‘happier than he has ever been’ as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an ‘emotional wreck - but in a good way!’ since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.‘It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn’t be happier. He is so protective of her,’ the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week.Meghan, 37, is understood to have just had her 12-week scan. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie’s wedding. It sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who has made no secret of his desire to start a family.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, toward the end of July, conceived their first child.In the middle of that month, they were on a ‘mini-moon’ royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry’s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.                                                    As they clasped hands Harry, 34, said: \u0027I was looking for you earlier and hoped you\u0027d be here, it\u0027s so good to see you again.\u0027Harry immediately looked round his shoulder and scanned the crowd for his wife, keen to introduce her to his special fan.Soon enough, the Duchess - who had been warmly greeted by hundreds of well wishers congratulating the couple on her pregnancy - approached Ms Dunne, knelt down and hugged her.War widow Daphne\u0027s first husband, Lieutenant Albert Chowne, died aged 25 in 1945 during an attack on a Japanese machine gun post in Papua New Guinea.He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross which Mrs Dunne was wearing when she first met Prince Harry.Meghan said: \u0027I\u0027m so glad I got to meet you. Harry has told me all about you and your special bond, it\u0027s so lovely you came to see us, thank you.\u0027Daphne said: \u0027It was lovely to meet the Duchess Meghan. Harry is a wonderful man and I\u0027m so happy he had found happiness, they both deserved the absolute world together.\u0027Asked if this time was the most special meeting her hero Harry, Daphne said: \u0027We\u0027ll it was certainly different. He\u0027s married now for a start and he looks very happy. I am over the moon for him. She is a wonderful girl.\u0027I congratulated them on their baby and said I wished them all the happiness they deserve.\u0027Before leaving, Meghan told her: \u0027Hopefully next time we\u0027ll have our little one with us.\u0027 Other editable locals included sisters Hannah and Francesca Francis, 12 and 10, said they were \u0027super excited\u0027 to meet the Royal couple outside the Opera House.The schoolgirls said they had waited for three hours to just catch a glimpse of the royal couple and \u0027couldn\u0027t believe it\u0027 when the royal couple came over to speak to them.Hannah said: \u0027I told my sister we would see Meghan today but I couldn\u0027t believe it when she came over to speak to us.\u0027She was so nice and friendly and she is so pretty. She was so nice to us and said thank you for coming down to meet her.\u0027Francesca said: \u0027We were both super excited to meet Harry and Meghan I just can\u0027t believe we did.\u0027Our friends are going on be so jealous, we\u0027re going to be taking about this forever.\u0027    Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, are seen meeting Ruby a mother Koala who gave birth to koala joey Meghan, named after Her Royal Highness          Prince Harry and his wife the Duchess of Sussex announced on Monday morning they are expecting their first child          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex met the tiny bears named after them when they married in May          Up close and personal: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted stroking the bears at the Taronga Zoo           The Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them          The ten-month old joeys were wedding gifts from the people of NSW for the couple, who got married in May - and just announced they were expecting their own baby          Meghan, showing just a hint of a baby bump, cooed at the koalas before stroking them, saying: \u0027Sweet, cute\u0027 as keeper Suzie MacNamara explained how the animals are threatened in the wild          In front of hundreds of Taronga staff, donors, young volunteers and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (second from left), Meghan used golden scissors to cut a line of green tape to open the centre          After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre          The couple was presented with a koala toy for their new baby - a hastily arranged surprise for the couple after the news of their pregnancy yesterday          Prince Harry - who has previously met koalas - was a tad more irreverent during the meeting          The then walked to the new Taronga Institute of Science and Learning holding hands, inspecting quokkas and wallabies before heading into the koala enclosure    The Duchess seemed very taken by the cuddly furballs and listened intently before asking if she could stroke them          After being invited to pet the echidna, the Duchess tentatively stroked its spines, which are used to track the animals and monitor their diet          The scientific research will allow those tackling the illegal wildlife trade to better pinpoint where animals are coming fromThe Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and 20 volunteers aged 13-19 from Youth at the Zoo programme: \u0027Zoos in the 21st century, they have to modernise with everything else that\u0027s going on around them.\u0027Taronga Zoo seems to be leading the way.

I don\u0027t think he has changed very much but I probably have. Seeing my age is going up, up, up,\u0027 she told reporter Sylvia Jeffreys.\u0027He\u0027s a natural. He just loves what he\u0027s doing but seems to fit in with everything he says. I\u0027m very happy for him.

And when he came back later, he gave me another one because I was lopsided, and I had to have another kiss to put me right.\u0027When asked where the third kiss will go, Ms Dunne laughed as she responded: \u0027I don\u0027t know, I might not even get one.\u0027       Thomas Markle, the father of the Duchess of Sussex has said he believes she will be a \u0027great mom\u0027 - but his daughter did not tell him she is pregnant            Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next Spring            The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed that  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland knew about the pregnancy and was said to be \u0027very happy\u0027. Thomas was not mentioned.  \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted. He heard the news before it was made public and was overjoyed. He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. A royal disaster!

Wait til you hear what Prince Harry said to crush Intern Pete\u0027s ego,\u0027 the caption teased.But fans didn\u0027t have to wait long, as another video was soon uploaded that revealed Harry\u0027s dry-witted response.    \u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry!\u0027 As Meghan and Harry arrived at the Sydney Opera House to meet their Australian fans, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement and began shouting at themAs Meghan and Harry approached the crowd of fans awaiting their arrival at the Opera House, Intern Pete couldn\u0027t contain his excitement.\u0027Hey Harry! Harry! Harry! I talk to you every year!\u0027 he breathlessly shouted.But Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027.Unfortunately, Pete didn\u0027t take the hint and awkwardly reminded the visiting royal that they had actually met \u0027a few times\u0027 before.             \u0027I talk to you every year!\u0027 Harry didn\u0027t show a hint of recognition when Intern Pete (pictured) reminded him they\u0027d met beforehand, and instead politely responded: \u0027Very nice to meet you\u0027            \u0027You behave today!\u0027 Meanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027            \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot LavaMeanwhile, In another clip shared to Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O\u0027s Instagram page, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was shown scolding Intern Pete  and warning him to \u0027behave\u0027.In June last year, Harry and Pete had another cringeworthy encounter when the radio personality attempted to introduce him to the childhood game Hot Lava.The game requires players to escape the floor by climbing on a surface within five seconds of someone yelling \u0027the floor is lava\u0027.Harry awkwardly laughed as Pete repeatedly shouted \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at him from behind a barricade. It was clear during the exchange that Harry had absolutely no idea what Intern Pete was talking about.   \u0027I\u0027ve longed for kids since I was very, very young\u0027: Heart-melting pictures that prove mischievous Harry was born to be a dadTrust Harry to cheer us up on a grey and fractious news day. Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010In 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd.

When congratulated by the media on their happy news, Harry smiled shyly and said \u0027thanks\u0027. They also accepted good wishes from dignitaries including the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP. \u0027Thank you, that\u0027s very kind,\u0027 said Meghan. The couple posed for a photograph on the croquet lawn with the Governor General and his wife with the magnificent backdrop of Sydney Opera House behind them.The duchess, who hasn\u0027t been to Australia before, marvelled at the view.

And thank you very much for organising the weather! Let\u0027s hope the rain stays off!\u0027 The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.

Peter Purves and Petra, the first Blue Peter dog and pet photographed in 1977. Petra spent 15 years on the show, having joined in 1962            Blue Peter presenter Simon Groom holds Blue Peter pet Goldie as he announces his engagement to Ann Costelloe, who was not a presenter, on the set of the show in 1979She first appeared on Blue Peter in 1962, when its very first presenter Christopher Trace fronted the show alongside Valerie Singleton.Petra, who was looked after by Trace, appeared as a regular for 15 years, and remained the longest serving animal companion until 2011.There is even a bronze bust of the beloved canine, crafted by William Timym, outside the Blue Peter studios in Salford.Petra gave birth to the second Blue Peter pet, Patch, in 1965. The pup was looked after by presenter John Noakes, until the pooch\u0027s death in 1971. Blue Peter then introduced Shep to its studios, arguably the most beloved of the brood to date. The Border Collie was the long-time companion of Noakes following the death of Patch, and the pair were inseparable.

As became tradition, her name was chosen by viewers.Goldie was the first in a long line of Golden Retrievers to appear on the show, including one of her puppies, Bonnie, who joined in 1986.The new mother left the show shortly after giving birth, and went to live with Groom on his Derbyshire farm.Bonnie then took up the mantle - and appeared with 16 different presenters on 1,150 editions of Blue Peter.The show\u0027s second Border Collie, Mabel, joined the show when she was just six months old in 1996, after being rescued by the RSPCA in south London.She became the longest serving pet since Petra, and was recognisable for having heterochromatic eyes (one blue and one brown) and distinctive ears.Mabel frequented the show alongside Lucy, a pedigree Golden Retriever who joined in 1998.Both Mabel and Lucy passed away within a month of each other in 2011, having served on the show for 14 and 12 years respectively.

Barney was the show\u0027s ninth dog - a former stray given to Helen Skelton by the Dogs Trust.The playful pup was said to receive just as much fan mail as Skelton, and he left the show with his owner in 2013.

Seattle native Paul Allen co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates after the pair became friendly in high school, and Allen’s philanthropic zeal went on to mirror that of Gates – with the former pledging to give away half of his wealth and spending $95million on charitable causes last year alone.Allen did, however, also take the time to enjoy the spoils of his fortune himself – as a brief glimpse of his homes, yachts, planes, art collection and fabulous lifestyle make glaringly apparent.The fortune of the 65-year-old – who died Tuesday after a battle with cancer – is estimated to be $20.3billion. He never married or had children his immediate surviving relatives are his sister, Jody, and her three adult children – who joined him on some of his global escapades over the years.They lived near him in suburban Seattle, Washington Allen owned at least nine mansions on wealthy Mercer Island, with his main residence listed as a 10,000-square-foot pile boasting a mammoth indoor pool area complete with a slide. One of the other mansions housed his late mother, who died six years ago at the age of 90, and other relatives lived nearby – and his properties also include a floating helipad off the island.Allen also owned an entire island off the coast of Washington, buying undeveloped and uninhabited Allan Island in 1992 with plans to develop a dream home there – but the absence of existing infrastructure and other problems prompted him to sell the land for $8million in 2013.          Allen, worth an estimated $20.3billion, built up an impressive international property portfolio, including Villa Maryland, pictured, in the French Riviera - where Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have spent time and where Allen hosted other celebrities          Allen stayed close to home, basing himself at this estate in the wealthy Seattle suburb of Mercer Island, where he also owned several other mansions, including one for his late mother          The Microsoft co-founder bought this property in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton - one of the most expensive zip codes in America - in 2013 for $27million it features eight bedrooms, 9.5 bathrooms, a spa, home movie theater, seven fireplaces and a 5-car garage over 22,000 square feetAllen spent a lifetime re-investing in his home city, ensuring that his favorite Seattle movie theater, Cinerama, remained open and modernized. He also bought the Seattle Seahawks football team in addition to the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team one state away in Oregon.His property portfolio, however, extended far beyond the Pacific Northwest. Allen purchased former estate The Enchanted Hill in 1997 in the swanky Los Angeles suburbs for $20million the Spanish Colonial home on 24 acres had been built in the 1920s for screen stars Frances Marion and Fred Thomson. Allen drew ire when he demolished the mansion full of Hollywood history, however, and terraced the land, leaving it otherwise undeveloped. He put it up for sale in July for $150million.He certainly had other housing options in California Allen also previously owned a white-walled contemporary home on a stretch of Malibu known as ‘Billionaire’s Beach.’ He bought the property in 2010 for $25million but sold it to Les Moonves in 2014 for a $3million profit – because he ‘hated the sound of the ocean,’ according to a New York Post source.Aside from that, the billionaire also bought a 12,952 square foot Mediterranean-style mansion in 1997 in Beverly Hills – complete with a funicular from the pool deck to the tennis court.          Allen bought a 12,952 square foot Mediterranean-style mansion in 1997 in Beverly Hills – complete with a funicular from the pool deck to the tennis court  Allen purchased two units at this luxury East 66th Street building in Manhattan he first splashed out $13.5million on an 18-room apartment on the 11th floor, then bought the penthouse in 2011 for $25millionAnd he didn’t leave Northern California out, either Allen purchased a whopping 8-bedroom, 9.5-bathroom home in 2013 in the San Francisco Bay Area community of Atherton – one of the nation’s most expensive zip codes. The 22,000-sq-ft residence also included a spa, a home movie theater, seven fireplaces and a 5-car garage.Allen didn’t limit his property purchases to the West Coast, however he also splashed out on an estate in Hawaii, a $7.5million, 10-acre property known as the Thurston Estate in Kailua-Kona, a region on the west coast of Hawaii’s Big Island. The property includes a $12,000-sq-foot main house, an employee residence, beach house, boat shed and a private harbor.The tech billionaire also invested in property in the West, splashing out on what used to be a sheep ranch in Tetonia, Idaho in 1993. The property operated as a luxury mountain lodge for some time called Teton Ridge Ranch, though it closed for business nearly ten years ago.A bit further afield, Allen also made property investments in New York City. He bought an 18-room 11th floor apartment in 1996 at 4 East 66th Street, a coveted Fifth Avenue address, for $13.5million. On top of that, he spent $25million in 2011 for the penthouse at the same address, a property featuring significant roof terrace space. The two apartments combined, one Manhattan real estate expert said at the time, would provide Allen with ‘a huge duplex penthouse.’           Allen also bought a historic Beverly Hills property called The Enchanted Hill in 1997 it was a Spanish Colonial mansion that he knocked down to replace with terraced, undeveloped land - which he put on the market in July for $150million          The tech billionaire spent a reported $7.5million on this 10-acre property known as Thurston Estate in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii it includes a 12,000-square-foot main house, employee residence, beach house, boat shed and private harbor          Allen, left, poses with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates the pair became friends in high school before starting one of the most influential companies of the 20th centuryAnd those were only his US properties. Allen also boasted a home in one of London’s swankiest areas – Holland Park – where other residents include notable billionaires like Richard Branson. In France, he was the proud owner of historic Villa Maryland, built in 1904 at the behest of a friend of King Edward VII. The sprawling estate in the Cote d’Azur played host to Allen’s celebrity parties and was even the site where Brad Pitt and Angelina stayed in 2006 ahead of the birth of Shiloh the family returned with their entourage of children, nannies and bodyguards two years later.All of those eye-watering mansions, however, are only the tip of the iceberg Allen’s veritable fleet of floating homes are just as impressive. The billionaire bought superyacht Tatoosh in 2001, valued at $160million the vessel carries a helicopter, a sail boat and several other boats. It can sleep 20 guests in 10 cabins, attended to by 35 staff in 16 cabins.Next up was one of world’s most extravagant yachts, Octopus, which Allen spent $200million to build before its official launch in 2003. The 414-foot vessel features a pool, two helicopters, a movie theater, basketball court, recording studio and accommodations for 26 guests in 41 suites. Allen famously hosted Cannes and other parties aboard the ultra-luxurious yacht, and often – as a huge rock-n-roll fan – treated guests to his own musical performances.In addition, it wasn’t unheard of for Allen to lend out Octopus for search and rescue operations or scientific studies. In the same vein, another addition to Allen’s floating empire was RV Petrel, a 250.8-foot research vessel he bought from a subsea engineering and construction company. He had the vessel completely refitted last year, and the RV Petrel has already discovered wrecks of the USS Indianapolis and the USS Lexington.Microsoft employees revolt over plans to bid for $10bn...After 24-year reign atop the Forbes list of 400 richest...Share this articleNot all of Allen’s fanciest possessions, however, were residential he also cultivated an art collection so impressive that he has been listed since 1999 in the Top 200 Collectors by ARTnews, the world’s oldest and most widely circulated art magazine.Allen built ‘a highly regarded collection that was notoriously guarded – for many years, he demanded that his employees keep quiet about his holdings,’ the magazine wrote following his death.‘In recent years, he began loosening the secrecy surrounding his collection, which focused on Old Masters, Impressionists, and modern and contemporary art, and included work by artists such as Renoir, Manet, Gauguin, and Seurat, as well as Mark Rothko, Edward Hopper, Alexander Calder, Ed Ruscha, and David Hockney,’ the magazine continued – adding that, in March, Allen sold a $30million painting by Willem de Kooning.A 2015 exhibition titled Seeing Nature – which drew from his collection – was shown in various locations across the US and ‘presented 39 landscapes, including Jan Brueghel the Younger’s depicting the five senses personified and an 18th-century view of Venice by Canaletto.           Another of Allen\u0027s yachts - Tatoosh - carries a helicopter, a sail boat and several other boats.

Turner, Georgia O’Keeffe, Thomas Cole, and Gerhard Richter,’ ARTNews reported, noting that Allen said at the time: ‘Some of these works are so amazing … so you do feel a real responsibility to keep them safe. You are the custodian. It is a serious responsibility, and I take it as such.’In keeping with that persona of custodian, Allen also showed great interest in vintage planes and amassed a significant collection beginning in the 1990s reported to be worth billions. His collection included fighters and bombers from Germany, Russia, the UK and Japan in addition to the United States, and Allen began showcasing some of the aircraft in 2004 in Everett, Washington at the newly-opened Flying Heritage and Combat Armor Museum.He also spent $349,000 on a Soviet scud surface-to-surface missile and $45,000 on a Cold War-era M55 self-propelled howitzer. Perhaps most famously, Allen shelled out $2.5million for a Panzer IV, a World War II-era German tank – only for the sellers to pocket the money and keep the tank, prompting a drawn-out lawsuit (it’s not immediately clear what happened to the tank in the end).What exactly will become of Allen’s fortune, however – who will get the properties, how much will be given to charity and what, of course, will happen to the superyachts – remains to be seen. He signed the Giving Pledge in 2010, one of 40 people who agreed to give at least half their fortune to philanthropy, and gave away hundreds of millions before his death this week. Now hundreds of millions of people and charities – and, presumably, his relatives – are waiting to see where the rest of that colossal fortune will end up. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/17/03/5161086C00000578-6283785-Meghan_Markle_held_an_umbrella_up_for_her_husband_Prince_Harry_a-m-259_1539745069052.jpg","title":"Meghan Markle Prince Harry visit Dubbo second day Australian tour","story":"    Prince Harry and Meghan react to the heavy rain as they visit students from Dubbo College Senior Campus where the Duchess was hailed as a role model by aboriginal students   Harry and Meghan were mobbed and the Duchess admitted she was a \u0027bit tired\u0027 and \u0027running on adrenaline\u0027 in the early stages of pregnancy          Duchess of Sussex watch aboriginal dances at Victoria Park in Dubbo, where students said a mixed race woman in the royal family was an inspiration to them  Despite being in a drought area Dubbo was hot with torrential rain but it did not dampen Meghan\u0027s spirits      Work understated elegance in Meghan\u0026#39s blazer by Serena WilliamsBuy it here...The Duchess of Sussex cut a casual figure for the second day of her tour down under.

It\u0027s a great pleasure to be able to visit this area now and be able to report back how much life has changed in the Great Western plains region since then,\u0027 Prince Harry said in his speech at Dubbo\u0027s Victoria Park.  \u0027Coming here brings back memories of 2003 when I spent some time on a small 16,000 hectare property in Roma in Queensland chasing cows through the bush... and it was great - I perfected the great Aussie salute.\u0027The greatest part about visiting country Australia is the people. You are the salt to of the earth: honest, hardworking and as tough as they come. That resilience, sense of humour and commitment to the land are what make you unique.\u0027You are the backbone of this country.\u0027 To laughter from the crowd, the drenched prince said: \u0027Despite recent welcome rain, it is going to take a lot more and a long time to recover.\u0027You are all the toughest people out there, the most persistent, the ones who can weather the storm or the drought.\u0027Prince Harry said while rural Australians had a lot to be proud of, \u0027I know that life has not been easy\u0027, in reference to the devastating drought.\u0027It must be hard not to lose hope when you endure so many dry months knowing you are powerless to do anything about it,\u0027 the Duke of Sussex said.\u0027The rich traditions of the Australian outback are legendary. You have a lot to be proud of. But I know that life has not been easy. You have just lived through two years of drought.\u0027And despite welcome rain it\u0027s going to take a lot more and a long time to recover. \u0027People in many farming communities generally don\u0027t feed themselves before they need, they are often more isolated, social networks are smaller and there is still a stigma surrounding mental health.

You are one huge community and with that comes an unparalleled level of internal support and understanding.   \u0027All you need to do is ask for it... chances are they may well be suffering too, and will relish the opportunity to either listen or talk themselves. You need to know a part of being strong and tough is having the courage to ask for help when you need it.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex unveiled a new aircraft for the Royal Flying Doctor Service while in Dubbo          The royal couple were greeted by signs including \u0027Dubbo loves Harry and Meghan\u0027 as they toured the Royal Flying Doctor Service\u0027s Dubbo facility           Before leaving the Royal Flying Doctor Service facility in Dubbo, the couple cut a cake marking the 90th anniversary of the serviceMarcus Wilson, 47, an ex-soldier who was running a medical service at the time, was awarded Australia\u0027s Bravery Medal for his actions. Inspired by Prince Harry, Mr Wilson will be taking part in the Invictus Games in the sailing event.Now manager of the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Broken Hill, about 1500 km from Sydney, Mr Wilson spent 14 years in the military - first as a gunner, then as a medic - before setting up a medical evacuation service for aid workers in Afghanistan.He was at NATO HQ in Kabul in October 2015 when a helicopter crashed near where he was standing.\u0027It missed me by 15-20 feet,\u0027 Mr Wilson, who met the couple at a RFDS event in Dubbo, said. \u0027It was an intense experience.\u0027I was the first on the scene. I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire - there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.           Dubbo crowds await the arrival of Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at a picnic in Victoria Park          The hundreds of people had waited for hours to catch a glimpse of the royal couple in the regional city \u0027I had had a chance to live my life. I didn\u0027t want other people to take the risk that I felt I should take.\u0027Medically discharged from the army because of a spinal injury, and traumatised by the helicopter crash, Mr Wilson found himself at a loss after leaving Afghanistan. Then he watched the Invictus Games in Toronto, and volunteered for the Sydney games. \u0027I have seen how much it has impacted not just on me but other team members and their families,\u0027 Mr Wilson said.At the RFDS event, which saw a new aircraft being delivered as the service marked its 90th anniversary, the Duke and Duchess also met patients including Keiley Storer, three, who has suffered from a larynx condition which blocks her airway.She gave the Duchess a posy. It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one. Then she saw Keiley looking and said, \u0027Would you like the big pink one?\u0027\u0027But Keiley got distressed that she pulled apart the posy.\u0027Her father Christopher said: \u0027She shed some tears shortly after. It was, \u0027Oh no, my posy\u0027.\u0027          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are showing their support for farming families affected by one of Australia\u0027s worst ever droughts while in Dubbo          The family explained how they have adapted to the drought, before inviting Harry and Meghan for morning tea at the homestead with their family          The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsWounded bodies on the ground after blast in Crimea kills tenSaudi investigators arrive at consul\u0027s residence in TurkeyTheresa May lays out details of \u0027temporary backstop\u0027 Brexit dealStudents outside Crimea school during shooting that killed 18Prince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceSaudi and Turkish investigators arrive to search consulateBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40The couple also met nurses and other staff and volunteers from the service. David Charlton, RFDS aviation general manager, said told the expecting couple that they deliver babies mid-flight several times each year.\u0027Our staff thought at was quite interesting, given the couple\u0027s current condition. The couple found it most amusing, and interesting. We all wanted to ask if it was a boy or a girl, but everyone behaved themselves.\u0027Before leaving, the couple cut a cake marking the anniversary. Harry gave it a good sniff, and helped himself to a bit of icing. \u0027He licked the icing from the knife,\u0027 Mr Charlton said. \u0027Which in Australian parlance \u0027is going straight to the pool room\u0027.\u0027The Duke and Duchess later met the Woodley family, who have operated a mixed sheep, cattle and cropping enterprise over five generations since 1887. Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm, including to the paddock where the Duke and Duchess had an opportunity to help feed the cattle.   Scott and Elaine Woodley, who farm full time alongside their 23-year-old daughter Laura, took Their Royal Highnesses on a short tour of the farm          The Duchess of Sussex whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her on a visit to a farm to highlight the plight of farmers hit by drought          Pregnant Meghan, 37, cooked the delicious treat in the kitchen at Admiralty House on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in SydneyFollowing the rule that a guest should never arrive empty handed, the Duchess had whipped up a loaf of banana bread to take with her.Meghan, 37, cooked up the treat - an Australian favourite - in the kitchen at Admiralty House, the home of the Governor-General of Australia, on Tuesday night following her first full day of engagements in Sydney.She took the cake, packed with chocolate chips and a touch of ginger, with her to Mountain View Farm.An aide said: \u0027She loves baking and just decided to take something along with her on the spur of the moment.The duchess also took along the perfect accompaniment- a tin of Fortnum and Mason \u0027Royal Blend\u0027 tea.Before the Duchess had even left, only a quarter of the loaf remained.Benita Woodley, 20, the daughter of Scott and Elaine declared it delicious: \u0027It was such a nice and thoughtful thing for her to do.

Prince Harry takes Meghan (and his Akubra) to rural Australia – 15 years after he spent his gap year working on a remote stationBy Kylie Stevens for Daily Mail Australia Prince Harry and The Duchess of Sussex have touched down for some fresh country air in rural Australia, bringing their Akubras with them to fit in with the locals.But the prince is no stranger to donning the iconic Australian hat.Their whirlwind visit to Dubbo in central New South Wales on Wednesday brings back vivid memories Prince Harry has of his time in country Australia 15 years ago.          Prince Harry, pictured in the Queensland outback in 2003, has very fond memories of rural AustraliaAfter graduating from Eton, Prince Harry, then 19, spent his gap year in 2003 working as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station, a sprawling 16,000 hectare cattle property 150 kilomtres northwest of Roma in outback Central Queensland.The station was owned at the time by Annie and Noel Hill, who were friends of his late mother Princess Diana.Mr Hill was the son of millionaire polo star Sinclair Hill, who coached Harry\u0027s father Prince Charles.Prince Harry spent three months working at the station and earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax.Working from 7.30am until 6pm, his duties include mustering cattle and mending fences, The Daily Telegraph reported at the time.He also found time to jet around Australia to a few Rugby World Cup games to cheer on his beloved England, who memorably won the tournament following a dramatic extra-time win against Australia in the final.          Prince Harry looked very much the seasoned stockman during his three month stint as a jackaroo at Tooloombilla Station in 2003          It\u0027s understood Prince Harry earned the very unprincely sum of $212.63 a week after tax\u0027I have had a great time working out here, meeting people and learning a bit about how to be a jackaroo,\u0027 Prince Harry said in a statement at the time.\u0027And of course the rugby was absolutely fantastic. It\u0027s a great country.\u0027One major downside to the working holiday was the lack of privacy and being under frequent public scrutiny with media crews permanently camped outside the station.There were reports the prince contemplated cutting short his three-month Australian adventure as a result.\u0027Learning about the farm and the jackaroo trade, that\u0027s what he wants to do, not dodge the cameras,\u0027 Prince Charles\u0027 press secretary Colleen Harris said at the time.Lib McEwan, wife of Injune Hotel licensee John McEwan added: \u0027I think our locals are starting to get a bit defensive because they\u0027re feeling sorry for him. The media is spoiling the whole deal that was supposed to happen.\u0027          Prince Harry developed a strong bond with Guardsman during his time on the station          Prince Harry was just 19 when he worked on an Australian outback cattle station for Annie and Noel Hill, friends of his late mother Princess Diana"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/22/5152F40D00000578-0-image-m-14_1539726957418.jpg","title":"One six children miss chosen secondary school","story":"    While last year, there were 582,761 applicants, this year there are likely to be more than 607,000This first caused problems for primary schools, with many having to create extra classrooms and super-size classes.Now the issue is transferring to secondaries as the extra children age.

I got people to get fire extinguishers and then spent one and a half hours retrieving the deceased and survivors from the wreckage, crawling through the air frame. The space that we crawled through was 35cm high. It was ankle deep in fuel.\u0027Because everything collapsed we had to use bolt cutters. We could not use saws because of the fuel.\u0027Five died - two RAF crew and three contractors - and four survived. Mr Wilson, who was one of three rescuers, added: \u0027It was terrifying. If it caught on fire there was absolutely no escape.\u0027Mr Wilson said he went inside the helicopter because he was older than most people at the scene.   \u0027I had had a chance to live my life.

It turned out to be a two-way transaction.Her mother Melissa, 34, said: \u0027She said, \u0027Would you like one too?\u0027 and gave her the white one.

The stone came from the same mine in Senhora De Lima’s native Brazil which has provided aquamarines for the Queen.It was not just Diana who enjoyed a special link with the generous Lucia, so too did William and Harry. When she visited Kensington Palace she always brought something for the boys.\u0027Who\u0027s this little cutie?\u0027 What Prince Harry said when he...Meghan masters the art of the tour wardrobe! Pregnant...Share this articleIf it was money, it was often a £50 note. ‘Ooh, a pink Granny,’ the boys would exclaim excitedly, a reference to the Queen’s head on the banknote.Harry never forgot such kindness and, when he and William were making their plans for a statue of their mother as a permanent memorial, they sought the views of Sra De Lima.Sadly, she died last year before the project could be completed. But both boys knew how much she meant to their mother during the years she was in London as the wife of Brazil’s ambassador to the UK, and later in Washington when he was appointed envoy to the U.S.Diana would often talk to Lucia and other friends of her ‘precious boys’ — but particularly of Harry. She adored them both but William, destined to be King, was marked from birth for special attention.As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry. ‘I have to,’ she would often tell me. ‘Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amounts of our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William.’            Princess Diana meets 91-year-old Nellie Corbett at the Lord Gage Centre in NewhamOne day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother, with whom the Princess had always had an ambivalent relationship.Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. ‘It’s not fair,’ Harry told his mother.Diana took it up with the Queen Mother explaining, as delicately as possible, that she would prefer it if she didn’t show favouritism to William. For her part, the Queen Mother argued that as William was heir to the throne he should be groomed as such. However, things did change a little. More than anything Diana didn’t want Harry to have a complex about his position in the family.She need not have worried, although slower at learning than William and more sensitive, Harry was a happy-go-lucky boy with a streak of curiosity.William, on the other hand, was slightly aloof, and this made him a little more serious and retiring.Diana empathised with her eldest son’s predicament. ‘He doesn’t want his every move watched,’ Diana would say.Whereas Harry’s attributes, she felt, were better suited for royal duty. She came up with the nickname Good King Harry, GKH for short, which she shared with a handful of friends.How Harry loved it when he was alone with Diana at Kensington Palace. Once, when home ill from boarding school, he gleefully told one of Diana’s friends: ‘I have got Mummy to myself . . . and I don’t have to share her with William!’Quite how many of his childhood memories from the Palace nursery Harry will recall as he becomes a father himself, remains to be seen. But there is one quality he is bound to want to replicate. Diana ensured that the domestic staff and police referred to the boys only by their first names, not as ‘Prince’ and never as ‘Your Royal Highness’.Says her friend Simone Simmons: ‘She knew they need to have a little dose of reality.’Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsWounded bodies on the ground after blast in Crimea kills tenSaudi investigators arrive at consul\u0027s residence in TurkeyTheresa May lays out details of \u0027temporary backstop\u0027 Brexit dealStudents outside Crimea school during shooting that killed 18Prince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceSaudi and Turkish investigators arrive to search consulateBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40  Princess Diana in Vancouver, Canada (left) and the Duchess of Sussex in Sydney on Tuesday She smothered them in love and tried to give them an education outside the classroom — hence those visits to the homeless and the sick during their childhood.But for all her efforts how heart-breaking it was to hear Harry recall last year of the times after his parents’ break-up when ‘we never saw our mother enough or we never saw our father enough’.All the same, Diana considered motherhood to be her greatest achievement. As the years pass it is harder and harder to visualise the beautiful young woman who died at 36 as a grandmother four times over, but how she’d have loved to have imparted some of her wisdom to the women who married her sons.She would, of course, have understood Kate’s wish to have her own capable mother, Carole Middleton, on hand for the arrivals of George, Charlotte and Louis, and installed as ‘Granny Number One’.But it may have been impossible to keep her out of the nurseryafter Meghan gave birth. For Harry will be fulfilling a desire his mother once held — becoming parent to a mixed-race child.Diana’s dream was to have a baby with Hasnat Khan, the kindly Pakistan-born heart surgeon with whom she fell in love after watching him operate at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital.And if it was a girl so much the better. For Diana this was no idle fantasy. She believed a child with Muslim Khan could have far-reaching implications for the world. It would help, she reasoned, bring the Muslim and Christian worlds closer together.Sheffield couple given one week to dig up \u0027dangerous\u0027 flower bedsWounded bodies on the ground after blast in Crimea kills tenSaudi investigators arrive at consul\u0027s residence in TurkeyTheresa May lays out details of \u0027temporary backstop\u0027 Brexit dealStudents outside Crimea school during shooting that killed 18Prince Harry helps speaker swat flies off her faceSaudi and Turkish investigators arrive to search consulateBritish man Marc Sutton snowboarding and biking in his spare timeMeghan holds an umbrella for Harry as he speaks in DubboMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40      With them in spirit: The Duchess wears Diana’s butterfly earrings at a Sydney reception            Honour the memory: Meghan also wore Diana\u0027s golden bracelet during the trip to AustraliaIt is tempting to wonder also how Diana would have handled the tragedy of Meghan’s father, the shock of his collusion with a photographer prior to the wedding, the embarrassing interviews and his isolation from his daughter.She treasured her own father and despite several significant differences, they never fell out. When Earl Spencer died suddenly at 68 in 1992, she was heartbroken and many have wondered if his absence helped precipitate her split from Charles that year.Her friends believe Diana would have been on the first flight for a rendezvous with Thomas Markle at his Mexican border hideaway to broker a reconciliation.In many ways, Meghan is the young woman Diana yearned to be, whose successes and achievements she earned for herself, not through marriage into the Royal Family. Despite the global fame it brought her, it was only after her split from Charles that she found a way to use that celebrity and turn it into a meaningful role.But no role would surely have surpassed that of grandmother.   Backups for every piece and detailed plans well in advance: Former royal maid reveals how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the tourShe has already wowed fans around the world with two outfit changes on the first official day of the royal tour.But it\u0027s not just the dresses that will be scrutinised over the coming 16 days, but every piece the Duchess of Sussex wears - from an artfully-placed folder to an item of jewellery that originally belonged to her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Former royal lady\u0027s maid, Alicia Healey, recently revealed how Meghan Markle\u0027s outfits have been chosen for the Invictus Games tour, and just how much preparation went into planning this event.

But little he said attracted as much interest as a brief glimpse of a picture hanging on a White House wall.In the picture, Trump is seen kicking back over a Diet Coke with nine Republican predecessors.We now know that the print, The Republican Club, is from a series of paintings by Andy Thomas, an artist from Missouri. The Democratic Club has the same set-up, but with Barack Obama holding court.Critics were quick to call the paintings kitsch and tacky. But in fact Thomas’s bizarre imagined scenes are examples of a time-honoured American form: celebrity montage art.Take Edward Sorel’s mural at the Waverly Inn in Greenwich Village, Manhattan, in which the illustrator pays homage to40 contemporaries including Truman Capote and Edward Albee. He has painted a mural at another New York establishment, The Monkey Bar, which stars icons of the jazz age. Another in Chicago pays tribute to luminaries of that city.In Hollywood, Thomas Suriya’s mural You Are The Star shows a cinema audience including Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Judy Garland looking at a notional screen.Where does America’s fondness for the celebrity montage come from? Debra Force, PBS Antiques Roadshow expert and owner of the Debra Force Fine Art gallery in New York, says depictions of imagined scenarios featuring political figures date back to the 18th century and the Founding Fathers, who she says were often depicted with “God-like features or God-like imagery around them”.In the following century, she says, especially around the time of the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, such images became more common.Like the Time magazine covers Trump obsesses over, for those who appear in them montage paintings can be bizarre status symbols.Not every composite image is quite so flattering. One of Trump’s most high-profile fans, the rapper Kanye West, has taken the phenomenon into the social media age. Famous, a music video and exhibition, shows wax works of 12 controversial figures – including himself and wife Kim Kardashian West, George W Bush, Trump, Taylor Swift and Bill Cosby – sleeping naked on a giant bed.Unlike Thomas’s complimentary painting, the Trump figure is overweight and somewhat grotesque. West said the piece was neither “in support” of or “anti” any of the people featured. It was, he said, simply “a comment on fame”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1fe8d018a33e4e94f351e27d8a725b98643d6e/0_0_7157_4295/master/7157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c65e52989b5ac23d33637ec900187c","title":"v and a uk largest christian dior exhibition designer of dreams london","story":"Princess Margaret’s birthday gown will feature in Designer of Dreams show in LondonA V\u0026ampA exhibition celebrating the life and work of the fashion designer Christian Dior is expected to be the largest retrospective on the French fashion house ever staged in the UK when it opens next year.Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams, which opens on 2 February, follows an exhibition of the same name that was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris last year, with the addition of a section documenting the designer’s fascination with British royalty and cultural figures.A highlight of this segment includes a gown created for Princess Margaret’s 21st birthday celebrations in 1951. The one-shoulder off-white tulle gown, decorated with asymmetric gold embroidery, was immortalised in Margaret’s official birthday portrait taken by Cecil Beaton.Items worn by high-profile clients including Nancy Mitford and the ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn will also be exhibited. The designer’s love of London landmarks such as Savile Row, where he bought his suits, and the Savoy, where he hosted his first show in the capital in 1952, will be celebrated, as will his many collaborations with British manufacturers including Dents, the glovemaker, and Lyle \u0026amp Scott, the knitwear brand.Despite the V\u0026ampA already holding many original Dior pieces in its archive, the exhibition’s curator, Oriole Cullen, said she and her team had embarked on intensive investigations to find many of the pieces that make this exhibition stand apart from its previous incarnation.“We did some detection work and found things that haven’t been seen before,” she said, citing a navy blue suit worn by a British client to the London Savoy show, who was famously photographed by John French outside. “The image has been in the V\u0026ampA’s archive for years but it’s very rare that the garment actually shows up.”Dior was also charmed by British stately homes, in particular Blenheim Palace. Two gowns from the first collection he showed there in 1954, at which Princess Margaret was guest of honour, have been selected from the V\u0026ampA’s archive.Dior in Britain, as the section is called, is one of 11 categories that will be displayed in the Sainsbury wing of the museum, the first time that a fashion exhibit has been staged in the space. Charting the fashion house’s inception under its founder, the inspiration he found on his extensive travels and the creation of the New Look in the 50s, the show also looks at the direction and enduring influence the fashion house retained after Dior’s departure.Cullen said work from Dior’s womenswear creative directors, including Marc Bohan, Gianfranco Ferré, John Galliano, Bill Gaytten, Raf Simons and the current designer, Maria Grazia Chiuri, would be displayed to “show how their differing approaches interpret and enhance the original codes”.In total, 500 objects will be exhibited. Accessories, fashion photography, film, makeup, illustrations and Dior’s personal possessions will sit alongside 200 haute couture ensembles, including a metal star that the superstitious Dior found on the streets of Paris the night before a successful meeting with an investor and one of the earliest Bar Suits, which defined Dior’s New Look and was gifted by the house to the museum in 1960.A history of the house’s fragrances – of which Dior once said “it is as important for a woman to have beautiful perfume as it is for her to have beautiful clothes” – has also been unearthed.The exhibition, designed by Nathalie Crinière, will fill the space left by the V\u0026ampA’s current fashion exhibition, Fashioned From Nature, which closes in January. It continues the V\u0026ampA’s run of high-profile fashion exhibitions, which have included Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty, The Glamour of Italian Fashion, and Balenciaga: Shaping Fashion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec1bf4bc262c51fe479bc26ae989cdc83d562e09/348_244_2837_1702/master/2837.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d5d44a75d4b2299d10ea10ddad6f03e","title":"judi edna glenda women who lit up the 70s in pictures","story":"In 1977, the National Portrait Gallery staged a landmark exhibition, featuring 90 portraits of eminent British women photographed by Mayotte Magnus.

We met newsreader and Classic FM host John Suchet to find outComplete the sentence: ‘Music and food are the perfect match because ...’They exercise your senses. Eating should be a sensuous experience, and sometimes you have to rush your meal, which is sacrilege in a way. If you’re able to, take time to enjoy it.What music do you play when you’re entertaining? Baroque has a nice steady beat, and sits nicely in the background. Vivaldi’s Four Seasons is an obvious one, but people can hum along while eating.What three songs would you always put on a dinner party playlist?JS Bach’s Goldberg Variations for the starter Vivaldi’s Four Seasons by Rachel Podger as a main then Gavotte Pavlova for dessert, served with pavlova!You’re cooking Beautifully Simple cod and prawns with fennel and white wine on the Classic FM podcast (see recipe below) – is it a combo you enjoy?Absolutely, my wife and I love fish, and I adore the aniseed taste of fennel – it goes so well together. A winning combination.What do the ingredients make you think of?Cod takes me back to my university days in Dundee. We’d go to a hot dog stand and have fish and chips with mushy peas. Now the batter is a lot better than it used to be!What kind of cook are you?I cannot cook. I’m not proud of this. I’m really good at boiling eggs though – I have a 1970s electric egg-boiling machine that my mum gave me. Every weekend I’m in charge of eggs!What’s your favourite dish?I absolutely adore duck in any form. Either confit de canard or magret de canard. Served with apple for a bit of sharpness, mashed potatoes and anything green.Are you an adventurous eater?I have one rule when it comes to what I won’t eat – it mustn’t be moving. As a reporter, you eat when you can, so I’m the absolute opposite of a fussy eater.What’s your go-to easy meal?My wife will slap a steak in a frying pan, grill it on one side, then the other. I like it with a bit of pinkness, no embellishments. Maybe a little bit of onion and garlic, nothing fancy.What piece of music reminds you of a particularly amazing meal?The last big story I covered was the 1986 revolution in the Philippines. The day after the president was elected, I got an exclusive interview with her – it was the high point of my career. That evening, I took my crew out to dinner in Manila and there was a string quartet playing Mozart’s Little Night Music. Whenever I hear it, I think of that interview.What music always makes food taste better?Music you enjoy. Andrew Lloyd Webber said there’s only good music and bad music, and I agree.What would be your desert island meal?Artichoke as a starter, followed by duck – I could find that on a desert island! Then lemon sorbet.Which restaurant plays the greatest music?I don’t like restaurants to play music. If you’re eating out, you’re with somebody you like and want to chat.If your favourite song was a meal, what would that be?Frank Sinatra’s I’ve Got You Under My Skin is my favourite song. I’m a trombonist and it has an amazing solo. It’s lively, so I’d say something Chinese – a stir-fry with scallops and noodles!Listen to John as he cooks on the Classic FM podcast at campaign.classicfmclassical-kitchenIngredients20g Duchy Organic English salted butter1 small bulb of fennel, thinly sliced (save the fronds)1 trimmed leek, sliced thinly150ml dry white wine, such as Californian chardonnay½ x 200ml pot Waitrose half fat French crème fraîche260g pack Icelandic cod loin, cut into thick slices8 raw extra-large king prawns25g Cooks’ Ingredients flat leaf parsley, choppedMethod:Melt the butter in a frying pan or medium casserole and add the fennel and some seasoning.

Not so many years ago, such a billboard would simply have read: “Kaffi og kleina” – in the language of the Vikings, the official language of Iceland.It is a privilege of the few to be able to read and write Icelandic, a language understood by only around 400,000 people worldwide. Icelandic, in which the historic Sagas were written in the 13th and 14th centuries, has changed so little since then on our small and isolated island, that we can still more or less read them as they were first written.But Iceland is not so isolated anymore, and there are signs its language is facing challenges never seen before. Following the economic crash of 2008, and the subsequent collapse of the Icelandic currency (making Iceland a much cheaper destination than before), tourism has emerged as the largest industry in Iceland, with 2.5 million tourists expected to visit a country of 350,000 people this year alone.And everyone is catering to the tourists in English, of course. At restaurants and coffee shops, people are frequently greeted in English rather than Icelandic, and often Icelandic will get you nowhere if you want to order food or drink. Companies use English names or are rebranding themselves in English. The importance of tourists to the economy is rapidly making English not only a second language in the service industry, but almost the first language. (The irony of this article being written in English is certainly not lost on me.)And we must consider the effect on our youngest generation. In Iceland, foreign films or TV shows have always been shown with subtitles, rather than being dubbed, resulting in most Icelanders being able to speak English. While Icelandic broadcasters have always dubbed cartoons and children’s shows, the online world has no borders. Kids today have almost an unlimited access to entertainment in English – movies and TV series on streaming services, video games, YouTube. Recent research shows an alarming rise in students under 15 struggling to read their own language. And they are picking up English at a much faster pace than before – it is not strange to hear them speaking it in the playground.Will Icelandic soon become the second language of Icelanders? All languages evolve, but so far we have managed to help Icelandic adapt to technological changes by creating new words for modern inventions such as the telephone (sími), TV (sjónvarp), email (tölvupóstur) and computer (tölva). Further evolution is, of course, inevitable. But with the ubiquity of English, is the Icelandic language at risk of disappearing more or less completely, and sooner rather than later?And this, of course, leads to the question: what value does a language have? If it is in danger, should we make an effort to save it?On a smaller scale, but with similar objectives in mind, myself and fellow crime writer Yrsa Sigurðardóttir set up a debut author award last year in Iceland. The Svartfuglinn (Blackbird) prize is for new crime fiction in Icelandic, in order to encourage emerging authors to keep writing in the language. In a similar spirit, Iceland’s leading producer of audiobooks has announced a goal to publish one new audiobook per day in Icelandic.But there is another sign of salvation on the horizon, from an unlikely source. Icelandic rap has been growing in popularity in recent years, and the leading artists in that genre usually write their lyrics in Icelandic, rather than English. Looking at the top songs in Iceland on Spotify, there are four Icelandic rap songs in the Top 5 – all performed in Icelandic. So, perhaps there is still hope.• The Darkness by Ragnar Jónasson is published by Penguin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0226b19691897b773191ccd85800887dbca94501/0_547_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c977675929b1aff8f8c10e3f27294582","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of themWelcome to this week’s blog. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces had several admirers last week. Peter Law-Jones wrote:Coming to the end of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a surreal journey through a febrile mind and New Orleans. The sense of a truly absurd world is both unsettling and very funny. An excellent read.And the Thepuffpastryhangman said:I’m enjoying A Confederacy of Dunces for a second time. An utter joy. The descriptions of Ignatius’s ‘hobby’ make me snork every time. Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Anna Burns has deservedly been crowned winner of the Man Booker prize 2018, and life returns to normal for everyone except her. No more gatherings of judges, no more anxiety for long- and shortlisted authors, no more sniping from the sidelines by critics, publishers and anybody who feels entitled to an opinion, whether informed by reading or not.We five judges met for the last time on Tuesday, to consider the remaining six books from the 171 offered for our scrutiny. It was clear very early in the selection process that some of those many books were not going to win. (There was one, and only one, about which I remarked it would not win the Man Booker if it was the sole contender.) The basic separation of sheep and goats was relatively straightforward.The hard part was dealing with the ones that we embraced with delight: novels whose narratives spellbound us whose craft impressed us whose prose enchanted us and whose ideas made us revise our own.At first we were tentative about casting aside a book that had any advocacy around the table. We didn’t know each other well enough to judge how best to express our own lack of love for the novel in question. But in the space of two or three meetings, we formed an understanding of how to work together effectively.The legend of the Man Booker is garlanded round with tales of arguments and tantrums, of judges threatening to throw themselves out of windows, of cries of: “Over my dead body.” I know it will disappoint anyone reading this, but we didn’t indulge in that sort of carry-on. Not that there was any lack of passion – each of us at one time or another spoke with enthusiasm and vehemence about books we had fallen for, explaining what had touched us and engaged our attention. But there was never a lack of respect or a failure of consideration.Even when we had to make our final choice, there were no ultimatums, no horse-trading, no sulking. Fuelled by coffee and chocolate, we talked our way through the shortlist one by one, itemising pros and cons. After a couple of hours, three books emerged as having slightly more cons than the other three.We took a 10-minute break. We came back and considered which of the three remaining books we would press into the hands of friends and family. Each of them, we decided, would find happy homes with different members of those groups … Again, we dug into the reasons we admired the books and what flaws we could find – because no books are perfect. Not even mine.And after more chocolate and another hour or so, Anna Burns’s remarkable novel emerged as the one we all felt was the right choice. Then it was finally time for the champagne.I’ve spent 10 months as a member of the best book club in the world. Most of that comes down to our chair, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah. He’s always been clear about our aims, about the way we conduct our meetings and our deliberations, and he set a tone that made sure everyone was listened to with respect. I’ve learned so much from these meetings, not least because we judges have very different backgrounds and working lives.No cliffhanging drama, then, except for the shortlisted authors at the dinner. Just a bloody good book for readers to get their teeth into. Enjoy!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/605ed53b251ab977d01089d6588ce6d3e5691165/21_1076_2219_1330/master/2219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b77b34093fb72f4fcf70e866e560677","title":"cheaper chocolate and meat drives down uk inflation in september ons consumer price index","story":"UK inflation dropped further than expected last month as the falling price of meat and chocolate helped reduce some of the pressure on cash-strapped British consumers.Combined with the pay growth figures for British workers, which showed average weekly earnings rising at the fastest rate in almost a decade, the latest snapshot for UK inflation suggests pressure on households is beginning to fade two years on from the EU referendum.Ferry prices also fell from a surprisingly high summer peak, while the cost of going to the theatre dropped compared to an increase a year ago.Despite inflation easing across almost every sector of the economy analysed by the ONS, some prices continued to climb last month, including gas and electricity bills.Drivers were hit with a 1.7-pence-per-litre increase in the price of petrol last month as the global oil prices hit the highest levels since 2014 amid growing concerns over supply constraints triggered by US sanctions on Iran. The increase was, however, less than a 2.5-pence-per-litre rise in the same month a year ago.The latest inflation figures also give the government the final piece of information required for uprating pensions and benefits from next spring, which is based on the September reading for CPI.Barring any changes by Philip Hammond in his the budget, household benefits will not increase in-line with inflation because of the benefits freeze.

The board is in dialogue with other potential candidates and will now continue the recruitment process in order to find the best possible person for the position.”Aarup-Andersen will continue in his current role as head of wealth management and as a board member. “I am proud and happy that Danske Bank’s board of directors recommended me for the position as CEO as it is a strong sign of recognition,” he said. “I have of course noted the FSA’s reply and their reasoning.”Analysts said they expected the bank would have to look for an external candidate to fill the top job. Danske’s board declined to comment further on its executive search."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82eee259d0ffaa96f833efcb55af76f1a166e0b4/0_77_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c963f7899d7a0f4f8b553a6038a96c6d","title":"dalstons soda its a great time to be making non alcoholic drinks","story":"The hip soft drinks brand is now stocked in many of the major supermarkets. Can it give Coca-Cola a run for its money?“The whole idea seemed completely insane,” says Duncan O’Brien, the founder of Dalston’s Soda Company, originally known as Dalston’s Cola. “But if a bunch of rag-tag chefs in Dalston can challenge Coca-Cola, one of the world’s best-known companies, then that’s fun! That’s why I wanted to do it.”Challenging big-name drinks companies with his own concoctions has been a source of joy and pain for O’Brien. But it was the slightly bonkers nature of it that made the prospect all the more appealing. It’s given him and his colleagues a driving force, an “underdog mentality”, he says.After three years of working long hours and becoming established locally – Londoners might have spotted bottles of Dalston’s in independent cafes and bars – the business has started to scale up in the past two years. Now there are six flavours: cola, ginger beer, lemonade, cherryade, orangeade and elderflower. Cans have more recently started to be stocked in Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Ocado. Dan Broughton, the company’s managing director, who joined two years ago following a stint at soft drinks and juice company Cawston Press, says it aims to be in 20,000 stores by 2022 and it’s currently in about 2,500. “We’ll never be able to dominate, but we’ll be able to take a slice of the market,” he says.A recent rebrand, which involved changing the name to reflect the bigger company and a new-look label, has helped to make the soda a recognisable player in the drinks market.They have been part of a burgeoning scene. O’Brien points to a renaissance in British food and drink that has made the industry a fascinating place to work. “Cast your mind back 10 years or so ago to what was available in the shops, it wasn’t that great. Quality products weren’t as accessible. But since then there’s been a street food revolution and the craft beer movement.“Taste is one area where I think many big food and drinks companies took their eye of the ball,” he says. That’s where he and his team saw an in: making something with higher-quality, natural ingredients, and therefore less of the sugar or artificial sweeteners relied upon to flavour mainstream sodas.What O’Brien terms the “Innocent and Fever-Tree effect”, has more recently led to a boom in investment in small, creative drinks companies. “Money people have cottoned on to the fact that there is money to be made in small food and drink businesses if it’s done right.”Being at the start of a wave of change is not perhaps what O’Brien might have imagined when he began selling his cola as a mixer in an alternative nightclub, Passing Clouds, in Dalston, back in 2012. The venue’s founder had decided generic Coca-Cola didn’t fit with the ethical and local principles of the club, and stopped selling it, creating room for something new.O’Brien describes all of this as being part of his roundabout career path: he studied anthropology at university, worked briefly and unhappily in the City, quit to become a chef on the Orient Express train in Scotland, and then ended up back in London, “washing dishes and doing bar work”, before working for a sustainability charity.The business that followed the success at Passing Clouds was bootstrapped. The first ingredients were bought from New Spitalfields Market, the fruit and vegetable wholesale market, and from Ridley Road market, a bustling trading street in the heart of Hackney. An enthusiastic local supporter invested £5,000, so that O’Brien could set up a factory, and the business went from delivering bottles by bike to transporting them in a van. Then the factory space started to feel cramped, and they moved to bigger premises.“I didn’t know what I was doing, really. I didn’t know then that most drinks companies actually don’t make their own drinks from scratch, or distribute themselves, for example.”That proved to be another useful differentiation from competing brands. “Large corporations often don’t have time to visit the farms supplying them, but when you do that you get to know people and taste their other products and that’s how you find the best ingredients. It’s a fun part of the job, I’ve visited blackcurrant farms here in the UK and lemon producers in Sicily.”Starting out wasn’t all easy. “With drinks businesses, there are low barriers to entry but high barriers to scale,” says O’Brien. That can lead to the need to make difficult decisions. “If you’re bootstrapping as a young person, you often start out with friends, but the people you’re with at the beginning probably won’t be the same ones around in the middle. That’s hard. You’re often running out of money as a small business too – it can get a bit squeaky from time to time.”He wouldn’t discourage anyone from trying the same, though. “It’s a great time to be making non-alcoholic drinks – there’s interest from retailers and buyers like never before,” he says. “Think of something that people want and need in their daily life, and then look at what’s out there – and if you think you can create a better version, then just go for it. Why not? Somebody might like it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84cb4f66673d7746cb3e4986cccc686de42b993/0_269_7360_4415/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a086c6f60776af6d8323c3eb867a406a","title":"if we wanted beauty wed travel to paris how calgary resisted its iconic pedestrian bridge","story":"The controversial Peace Bridge is now one of the most-used walking and cycling routes in Calgary. The councillor behind it reveals the project’s stormy process“The level of hatred directed towards that piece of infrastructure was out of proportion with the cost,” says Druh Farrell as she recalls the stormy process leading to the construction of Santiago Calatrava’s pedestrian and cycling Peace Bridge in Calgary. “It was an incredibly painful process. It became so intense.”The celebrated Spanish architect was brought in to address a complicated brief. The crossing – connecting downtown to the northern river pathway and the community of Sunnyside – had to completely  the Bow River, while being flat enough to avoid obstructing a nearby helicopter-landing area.Bringing in a big name didn’t change people’s opinions, however. For the opening of the bridge, councillor Farrell was escorted by four bodyguards. Even Farrell’s brother had to endure the ire directed at the Peace Bridge when a dinner guest discovered their relation and said to him: “You tell your sister that if we wanted beauty, we’d travel to Paris. In Calgary we just need it to work.”“It was the first piece of significant infrastructure predominantly for active mobility,” Farrell explains. “If it had been for vehicles, we would not have had any debate, and it would not have been controversial.”Most Canadians know Alberta as “Oil Country” due to its economic dependence on the Tar Sands. Calgary, Canada’s third-largest city, is home to a number of oil and gas headquarters. Covering a 848 sq kilometre area – eight times the size of San Francisco – and sprawling endlessly into the prairies, it’s easy to see why driving has become the default mode of transportation for the vast majority of Calgarians.In recent years however, things have started to shift, and residents have begun demanding options. Farrell sits at the heart of that transition. In 2007 Calgary’s Centre City Plan was passed by a vote of the council under the then-manager of planning and design, Brent Toderian. The plan established that they would not consider any new river crossings for motor vehicles entering the downtown core. Situated where the Bow and Elbow rivers meet, Calgary’s downtown is only accessible from the north and east by means of a river crossing, resulting in several car-dedicated bridges that are largely unwelcoming to cyclists and pedestrians.The Centre City Plan identified three locations where potential bridges could be built, dictating two simple criteria: they had to be dedicated pedestrian and bicycle crossings only, and they had to be beautiful. But as Farrell soon found out, building something of beauty in “Cowtown” would not be as easy as it seemed.The total budget for the bridge was C$24.5m (£14.2m), half the cost of a planned highway interchange in nearby Cochrane, 11 miles west of Calgary, that would serve one-50th of the population of Calgary.“Now I think most Calgarians would recognise it was worth it,” she asserts emphatically. “I certainly believe it was worth it because the bridge is so well used.”In spite of the initial negativity, the bridge stands out for Farrell as a memorable pivot point for Calgary. “The Peace Bridge really was a first for a lot of reasons,” she says. “It got people talking about architecture, and it identified a bottled-up need and desire for more walking and cycling connections to our downtown core.”In the years to follow, the city constructed the George C King and Elbow River Traverse bridges – a pair of pedestrian and cycling connections to the east of downtown, with a fourth crossing planned to the west when demand grows to sufficient levels.The iconic structure has become more than just a gateway to the city. “What we ended up doing unintentionally with the Peace Bridge is building a public space over the river,” recalls Farrell. “It’s far more than a transportation hub or connection – it’s a meeting place, a sense of place, on top of our beautiful river.“It’s the most photographed structure in the city. It’s used for the promotion of Calgary in everything from real estate to hotels, and included in international bridge-design showcase books. It reinforces that we did the right thing.”The Peace Bridge also laid the groundwork for Calgary’s next big cycling infrastructure project: a downtown cycle-track network.Within a year of the bridge opening, the latent demand for cycling infrastructure became clear. As more people were using the trails and bridges to enter the city, they needed a comfortable place to travel once they burst onto the downtown streets.Farrell stood at the forefront again, providing the initial push for the 7th Street Cycle Track that would connect directly to the Peace Bridge. Perhaps unsurprisingly, talk of reallocating road space spurred anger.After the construction in 2013, the 750m bidirectional, curb-protected lane quadrupled cycling numbers along that corridor overnight. Initially the project was to be completed in increments, but the discussion shifted to the idea of building the whole scheme at once as an 18-month pilot project. It seemed to be smooth sailing until a change of council later that year made the politics more challenging.“Pilots are so important. For one thing, we were constantly adjusting,” explains Farrell, referring to the 100 tweaks that staff made in response to data collected at 80 different points. These changes were facilitated by the provisional nature of the scheme, including flexible delineators, planter boxes, temporary concrete curbs and floating traffic signals.“The transportation department was extremely nimble in identifying problems and mitigating them. By the end of the pilot, the system worked. So they weren’t just waiting until the end of the project to make adjustments – they were doing it all along and measuring the data. We had such a compelling case. We had more people cycling: different people, young people, women, and families were all using the network. It was hard to say ‘no’.”In December 2016, the council voted 10–4 in favour of making the network permanent, meaning that the pilot had accomplished exactly what was intended: demonstrating to a skeptical public that with safe separated space for cycling, even the sprawling, frigid cities of the Canadian Prairies will get on their bikes.Councillor Diane Colley-Urquhart, who had initially voted against the pilot, changed her vote, telling reporters: “I was a person that didn’t support this in the beginning. I thought this was madness. But, to see how it’s evolved, and how it’s working and to see how people are starting to get the fact that this is shared public space …”Now Calgary’s cycle network is cited as a reason companies and employees are relocating to the city. As Farrell said: “If we want to attract new industries to Calgary, we need to first build a city that’s worth moving to.”Building the Cycling City, by Melissa Bruntlett and Chris Bruntlett, is published by Island PressFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d6afcdf3b8c4b7b68afd379348399821a6119bd/0_236_2605_1563/master/2605.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=336826c807cd94892eacd16d16d87301","title":"labour mp votes brexit deselect","story":"There are no excuses when the party has the chance to bring down the government, or even stop BrexitFor all the huffing and puffing, for all the complex games of bluff over the Irish border and the transition period, the important facts of the Brexit deal remain relatively simple. Between the red lines of the DUP, the Tory right and the Tories’ liberal wing, there ought to be no deal which can get a majority in the House of Commons. This situation should bring down the government, or stop Brexit from taking place, or both.The only way that Theresa May can be sure of delivering a majority is with Labour assistance. The Labour leadership will not wobble in its resolve to oppose the deal – doing so would pass up a golden opportunity to bring down the government and tear the Corbyn project apart. The Labour MPs who might back the deal are almost all from the centrist wing of the party, and fall into three categories: genuine Leavers, timid MPs representing Leave seats and those who profess concern about a no-deal scenario arising from a government defeat.Any Labour MP who fails to vote against the Tory Brexit deal would be making the biggest mistake of their political lives. Corbyn’s opponents in Labour have bet their collective credibility on claiming to be better at parliamentary process and being anti-Brexit. Now, some of them stand on the brink of voting through a catastrophic version of Brexit, and falling for the wholly predictable propaganda line that voting down the deal would result in no deal. There is simply no excuse for believing this – if the deal falls, parliament will get to decide what happens next.The idea of propping up the Tory government in a vote of this kind sits well with a certain tendency of the Labour right, appealing to the national interest and statesmanlike conduct. It is the same tendency that has seen establishment Labour leaderships whip with the government on issues such as welfare reform, and which was most dramatically demonstrated with the formation of the National Government by Ramsay MacDonald. In times of national crisis, there has always been a portion of the parliamentary Labour party that has been willing to put a painful sense of self-regard ahead of the petty mission of being Labour MPs.The consequences of a Tory Brexit deal passing are serious. By propping up the government, it is likely to guarantee the continuation of austerity and welfare cutbacks, which have devastated lives and communities, for a further four years. Its substantive effect will be to give Liam Fox the power to reshape the British economy by signing regulation-busting trade deals, and will mean a huge loss of rights and protections for workers, migrants and the environment. By handing victory to the Brexiters, it will embolden the most reactionary elements in British politics and their narratives.So Labour’s grassroots – the overwhelming majority who are on the left and who want to oppose May’s deal – must be clear about what their response would be if the government passes its Brexit deal with Labour support. After Labour’s conference, the process for deselecting an MP is much easier, with only a third of local branches or local affiliates required to trigger an open contest. Any Labour MP who fails to vote down the Tory deal must not be allowed to contest the next election as a candidate.Labour MPs have often been led on to the wrong side of history by the heat of a national crisis or the allure of the political establishment. But at almost every turn, from the National Government of the 1930s, to the neo-liberalism of New Labour and the austerity politics that followed it, those who abandon the will of the Labour movement for lazy answers inside the Westminster bubble have lived to regret it. Those now in parliament would do well to remember that.• Michael Chessum is a freelance writer and socialist activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67695bda4e66888f492c39d0d030855caf9c4517/0_216_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f53f26711deea7a0eed938f62646dd0","title":"universal credit left behind far right austerity","story":"Universal credit plans won’t only make people poorer. They will open the door for the far right.On a visit to Grimsby, a man tells me that hope is a buffer between himself and abject poverty. It doesn’t sound like asking for much. But take that buffer away, as universal credit looks set to do for millions across Britain, and you make room for hate.The choices the government makes come with consequences. Universal credit could leave families £2,400 a year worse off and cause 3 million people to wait at least five weeks for a first payment. This will not only push people from “just about managing” to food banks. It will also add to anger and resentment widely felt across the country. Anger and resentment on which the far right feeds.The rollout of universal credit might have been postponed, but on top of years of cruel austerity that has consistently hit the poorest and the most vulnerable hardest, the fact that the government is still planning to implement these plans at all is disgraceful.Gordon Brown is right to suggest that the introduction of universal credit may result in riots. In fact, he didn’t go far enough in his predictions to link this to a far-right threat. These changes won’t solve the budget deficit but they will add to tensions.It is no coincidence that the BNP never took hold of Cambridge, or that Ukip fails to make ground in London. The hard end of the political right has found strength in exploiting genuine anxieties in communities that have been hurt most by globalisation and austerity. They have offered mass immigration and “cultural incompatibility” as simple answers to complex problems.We need to tune into the scale of that threat in 2018, where high levels of employment belie precarious and destructive working conditions, with food bank use at its highest on record, stories of children eating out of bins, and the closure of key services that once held our communities together. People are angry about immigration, but they are much angrier about industry closure, job losses, precarious working conditions and a political elite that doesn’t want to know.HOPE not hate’s new report, Fear, Hope and Loss, suggests that predicted economic decline as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU, as well as hardened austerity measures such as the introduction of universal credit, could open the door to a rightwing, populist surge. Our report tracks attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism using seven years of polling and answers from 43,000 people, and maps them to neighbourhoods in a more granular fashion than has been done to date.We find that the most hostile attitudes to immigration and multiculturalism are concentrated in areas that have lost the wealth and stability they once had, single-industry towns that have seen rapid decline and where there is a sense of hopelessness. Identity issues are dialled up or down depending on how the economy is doing, while a sense of power and privilege slipping away fuels resentment. This sense of loss fuels fears among dominant groups of being “overtaken”, a dislocation of social status and wellbeing for those who are white and British, who struggle to keep up with progressive social norms.The demise of the political far right in the UK does not mean the threat has been eliminated. We have witnessed a growth in online activism headed by international far-right figureheads such as the former English Defence League leader, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson. The recent #FreeTommy campaign sparked the revival of a far-right street movement, drawing people on to the streets of Westminster in greater numbers than any demonstration held by the EDL.We mapped Change.org petitions in support of #FreeTommy, one of which racked up more than 630,000 signatures, and found that the majority of UK signatures came from post-industrial or coastal towns, places that have seen significant decline and long-term issues with unemployment and deprivation.Political manifestations of hostile attitudes may have moved from the ballot box to online petitions, from local representatives to global figures, but environmental drivers still charge these sentiments and their political mobilisation. There is palpable anger and resentment across the country, most concentrated in communities that have consistently lost out in a redistribution of wealth to core cities or overseas.Our report also finds newfound optimism about the future directly linked to Brexit in communities where deprivation drives hate. Many feel that Brexit will solve their problems. But with economic projections suggesting that the impact of a hard Brexit will affect those living in our poorest regions most, this bubble of newfound optimism will burst. An economic crash will most likely add to inequality, rather than reverse it, creating a window of opportunity for populist exploitation.A potent mix of cruel austerity policies, national economic decline, anti-establishment mistrust and false hope for a prosperity-delivering Brexit present fertile conditions for hateful narratives to explain away these problems.We need a better offer than universal credit. People need to know there is hope.• Rosie Carter is senior policy officer at HOPE not hate and author of Fear, Hope and Loss"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d37753bb99fcfe026b6cf508bf045bae76a0724/0_128_4344_2606/master/4344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b575dd6ce0de786be585409a961d3eb","title":"we need another eu referendum tony blair nick clegg michael heseltine","story":"It would be an understatement to say that the negotiations to take Britain out of the European Union have not gone well.For all the promises made during the referendum, the advocates of leaving the EU both underestimated the fundamental importance of Britain’s integration into the European-wide economy and failed to explain the sacrifices that Brexit inevitably involves.Leaving the EU means making huge choices between economic security, through membership of the single market and the customs union, and the ending of shared sovereignty, but the Brexiteers continue to live in a fantasy land of denial. They believe that, sooner or later, the EU will capitulate. The failure of the EU27 to play the role allocated by the Brexit script writers, however, has made the Brexit cheerleaders ever angrier and more and more anxious to find someone else to blame.Ultimately, though, whether we are willing to pay the economic price to leave the EU is a matter for the United Kingdom. Our domestic debate is far from over and, even at this late hour, many of us are continuing to make the case that the British public needs to make the final decision once we are in possession of all the relevant facts. So we ask our European partners to be ready to give us the space and time, if necessary, to make such a final decision. Until then, we of course respect their right to act on, and prepare for, the decision of the UK to leave until or unless that changes.As well as this failure to appreciate the economic costs of leaving, our government has also underestimated the political investment of our European allies in the project of the EU. That failure continues to breed unrealistic hopes in Britain of not just a “last minute” major concession by the EU side in the current negotiations, but of something even more delusional: that once the UK has left and is in the transition period, the 27 remaining member states will capitulate on the principles of the single market and give Britain access to the market without abiding by its rules.This is the myth that drives some in the UK to seek a “blindfold” Brexit, in which the UK leaves in March 2019 with a fudge, leaving the terms of our future relationship with the EU vague. Such an outcome should be unthinkable for Britain and would be deeply dangerous to the European Union. For that reason we urge that it be resisted vigorously by all those who care about Europe’s future.There are two sorts of advocates of a blindfold Brexit in Britain: the naive optimists and the cynical pessimists. The naive optimists are those people described above, who believe that once the UK is out, the EU will suddenly decide it is willing to overturn its legal and constitutional order to give us a licence to do what it likes about the customs union, the common commercial policy, and product and environmental standards inside an enduring relationship.The cynical pessimists are different in that they seek the hardest of Brexits and believe it is worth agreeing to a flimsy, non-binding deal that gets them over the line in March 2019, because they know they could simply tear it up as soon as the UK is out. This would provide the pretext they have always wanted for their programme of extensive labour market deregulation and corporation tax cuts.For the European council, the temptation to concede a blindfold Brexit must be strong. Getting the British out of the EU and into the transitional period with the minimum of fuss and disruption might seem like a worthwhile goal, but it will not settle the Brexit question. It is crucial to remember that while a withdrawal agreement will address the Irish border, citizens’ rights and the financial settlement for leaving the EU, a vague political declaration on the future will leave our UKEU economic relations, and many other issues, unsolved. This would send a dangerous signal to the destructive populists inside the EU and to those who wished Europe ill. The precedent of leaving the EU with no arrangements in place for the future would now be set.At the same time, such departure terms would also risk prolonging the Brexit process for years to come, further sapping energy and resources from the EU at a time when there is no shortage of challenges to the international trading and security order. So while we understand that the EU27 must act in the interests of their citizens, a blindfold Brexit would not be that.Meanwhile, in the UK, the demand for a “people’s vote” on the outcome of the negotiations will continue to grow. The politics of all this is in flux and now is not the time to shut down options either for Britain or Europe.Regardless of what path the UK takes in the coming weeks, there can be no denying that a strong European Union will remain in the UK’s interests. Its ability to bring such a erse group of states together and bind them under law and in support of human rights, free markets and free trade is a magnificent achievement and one that should never be sold short or undervalued.As leaders from different political traditions in Britain we have disagreed about much in the past, but what we have in common – our support for democracy, the rule of law, free expression and free trade – are also fundamental European values and they are all worth defending.• Tony Blair is a former Labour prime minister Nick Clegg is a former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister and Michael Heseltine is a former Conservative deputy prime minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

In partnership with the company Blue Planet, he was demonstrating a low-tech-looking machine that can pull carbon dioxide from the air and store it in construction materials.If every new building for the next 30 years was made with the resulting product, humans could erase the globe-warming pollution they’ve sent into the atmosphere, said Fiekowsky, founder of the Healthy Climate Alliance network.Blue Planet’s technology is nascent in a scene dominated by a few companies that specialize in carbon removal, and it won’t be the last newcomer.People have done too much damage to the climate to avoid catastrophe just by halting the burning of fossil fuels. They now will have to re-engineer the world, according to scientists with the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The livability of the planet will thus depend largely on tools that are now available only on a small scale and currently still expensive.The key, Fiekowsky said, is not the technology itself. It’s having a meaningful goal: restoring the climate, “because it means maybe we’re not doomed”.The UN’s recent report – which says it will require unprecedented action within the next 12 years to keep temperatures from climbing beyond a current 1C increase to a 1.5C increase – does not inspire optimism in many carbon removal experts.While it’s technically feasible to slow fossil fuel use fast enough and capture enough greenhouse gases to limit warming, the world is not on track to do so.Scaling up carbon capture technology is possible but will be difficult, said Kurt Waltzer, managing director for the Clean Air Task Force.“We are absolutely going to have to have a significant amount of carbon removal, there’s no question about it,” Waltzer said. “The level will probably depend on how quickly we can get to a zero-carbon world, but it is going to be enormous.”Most of the work has previously centered around sequestering carbon from power plants, which is different than drawing it from the air.James Mulligan, carbon removal expert at World Resources Institute, said direct-air carbon capture technologies are “unproven at the scale that we’ll need them”. A decade ago, they were viewed as “impossibly expensive”, he said. Now, some are touting a cost of $100 to $200 per ton of carbon.“That’s still expensive,” Mulligan said. “But halting climate change isn’t going to be free.”Reforestation and new agricultural practices could also trap carbon and help slow warming. But direct removal will still be necessary.With direct-air capture, the most obvious option is to store carbon underground. But technologies that create a sellable product will help reduce costs. Three of the biggest direct-air carbon removal companies – Carbon Engineering, Climeworks and Global Thermostat – are all working to store CO2 in something useable.Carbon Engineering markets a carbon-neutral fuel. Climeworks sends carbon to fertilizers, fuels and soon, the beverage industry. Global Thermostat sells the gas for a wide range of purposes.Products made with carbon don’t demand a high enough price to boost capture around the world, so expanding them will require government intervention.Louise Charles, a spokeswoman for Climeworks, said the company has found government support in Europe and has 14 direct-air capture plants built or under construction. But she said there just isn’t enough money in the industry yet. Next year, Climeworks will enter a new market, letting iniduals pay to catch and store carbon to account for their own emissions from flying and driving.Steve Oldham, the CEO of Carbon Engineering, said interest in his company has increased in the last few weeks in light of the IPCC report, which he said may be good for business but is overall “kind of scary”.“We think we have a solution that could be part of solving the problem,” Oldham said. “But the missing piece in the middle is policy, and policy requires both need and a solution.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2549969f8aa472b89d124039cbca5c0cf9d0414a/0_113_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b4cca2e7e2a8cf507018bde688efc7b","title":"winner wildlife photographer of the year 2018","story":"Dutch photographer Marsel van Oosten’s stunning portrait of two endangered golden snub-nosed monkeys in China’s Qinling mountains has won this year’s prestigious prize.

So buckle up, principled readers, I’m about to get all Hello! on your principled arses.To the royal baby! Now that the Diana storyline has finally, after a full 20 years, came to a conclusive end with Prince Harry’s happy wedding, a new plot was clearly needed to fill the void. (Twenty years! Even the mysterious death of JR only ran for eight months on Dallas. Whoever writes these royal storylines really should give masterclasses.) The Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s baby was always going to be the source of self-parodically overheated commentary, with the Mail this week engaging in some full-throated Meghan bingo. “Mixed race”, “multicultural Britain” – yup, reckon we got a full house in this article. It’s always fun to watch the Mail having to tiptoe carefully through this field of cliches, after the paper sparked a public reprimand from Harry when the Mail on Sunday did another kind of Meghan bingo and described his then girlfriend as “exotic” and “racy”, and debated whether it was worse if she was “a bolter” or (bonus points!) “black sheep”. Try not to go full colonial before lunchtime at least, Mail.“This baby is not just any baby,” the paper solemnly intoned this week. Is it an M\u0026ampS baby? Oh, sorry, I think I just confused my British institutions. But they are right, this is not just a baby, it is a baby at the centre of various warring factions, just like any good royal baby should be. On the right, there is the York family, whose special day – Princess Eugenie’s wedding – was decidedly overshadowed when Harry and Meghan announced the pregnancy to their family members. Now, this column is no fan of the popular idea that brides have the emotions of toddlers and therefore expect to be the centre of attention all day. But we are talking about the York family here, who insisted on throwing a £2m wedding for Eugenie, paid for by the public even though most of the public wouldn’t recognise Eugenie if she whacked them on the head with a tiara because she doesn’t, actually, do anything. So we’re not dealing with actual grownups with normal emotions here. Exactly how the Yorks felt about Harry and Meghan gazumping their day was made especially plain by Sarah Ferguson (twitter handle: @SarahTheDuchess) frantically tweeting images from the wedding, retweeted by her husband, at exactly the moment the palace announced Meghan’s pregnancy on Monday morning. Some might have thought that Fergie could have given Harry and Meghan a break, given that they invited her to their wedding, unlike William and Kate. But that is to underestimate Fergie’s pettiness, and, let me tell you, I am here for it.Speaking of pettiness, enter stage left, the Markle family! I genuinely cannot get enough of the Markles, with Samantha and her rants-for-pay about how outrageous it is her spoilt cow of a half-sister won’t be nice to her, and her father Thomas, bemoaning to tmz about how cross Meghan is because he is always talking to, um, tmz. Honestly, the scriptwriter who came up with these characters, give them a raise! Samantha this week, we were told, “broke her silence” about the pregnancy (her silence? She was slagging off Meghan all over Ireland last weekend. The Markles’ silences are like Ivanka Trump’s feminism, existing purely in the eye of the beholder). She added that the pregnancy “makes everything that happened over the past year disappear”. Mmmm, would that “everything” be you and your father blabbing about Meghan to every hack with a Florida phone book who calls you up? Reckon Meg might feel differently, Sam.So there we are, we’ve only known about the royal foetus for half a week and already we have two major plotlines brewing and, sure, maybe they are just distractions from actual important stuff, but when the actual important stuff is so depressing, surely it’s better to be distracted than depressed? Bring it on, ideally straight to the day of the birth, when Samantha tries to storm hospital security and Fergie celebrates the big day by tweeting baby photos of her daughters.

I sent him a postcard saying something along the lines of: “Dear Mike, I believe you’re doing a film on Peterloo. I would love to be part of it, but if not, it’s wonderful news that you’re bringing the story to a wider audience.”That was about a year before the film started shooting. He wrote back and said: “Of course you can be in it, I don’t quite know what I’m doing yet. I’ll call you when I do.”Mike has always been an actors’ director, known for responding to correspondence from actors. I first met him when I left drama school. I did my final-year showcase at Rada, where you get to perform two pieces of your choosing in front of various agents and casting directors.

We wrote to the casting director Nina Gold – one of the best in the business, who casts Mike’s films – and as a result we were invited to meet him. Sally, of course, went off to work with him immediately and they have collaborated many times over the years now she is a multiple Oscar-nominated star.

Between us we not only created a backstory for our own characters, but also for the whole family and the whole street they lived on.Nellie is the matriarch of a poor, hard-working family from Manchester (Angel Meadow, to be precise) and a mother of five. People who have seen the film have been surprised, as they regarded her as not political. I beg to differ. Nellie may not be a reformer or an active part of the movement, but she is very clued up on the workings of the world. She cares passionately about the future, not just for her children and her children’s children, but also for society as a whole. Nellie fears the struggle has been hijacked by a lot of men spouting a lot of hot air. She is a doer – actions not words – but there is the rub ... partaking in direct action at this time could get you the death penalty.A lot of the audience were people who knew very little about Peterloo or the poem. They wanted to talk, to debate. It felt like a really important time for me. I had begun to feel disillusioned with politics and I was trying desperately to keep my faith that another way could be possible. At the same time, it felt as if hope had started to grow again. It felt as if there was a door opening for people who wanted a better, fairer way.The Labour party’s “for the many, not the few” goes back to the last line of The Masque of Anarchy: “Ye are many – they are few.” I joined Labour so I could vote for Jeremy Corbyn. I had always voted Labour, but I never had any intention of joining the party until it became viable that Corbyn might become the leader. We have just had the party conference and, all right, I am biased, but as far as I am concerned, this year has been extremely encouraging and positive. It felt like a proper party conference. Socialism is on the cards again – it is no longer ridiculed as something archaic and naive.The Peterloo massacre was not something I was taught in school. I had a typical comprehensive history education: kings and queens, nothing about my people, nothing about working-class history. It was only through my grandfather that I gained any knowledge of Peterloo. He gave me a potted history when I was about 12 or 13.My grandfather had a life-changing influence on me. He never had any ambitions to be a politician – he worked on the assembly line at Leyland Motors – but his life was politics. He was a self-educated man and he had a thirst for knowledge. He was a member of the Communist party. I joined when I was 18. My grandad wanted me to wait until I was old enough to make my own decisions. He warned me: “Getting involved in politics is not a hobby, Maxine. It has to be your whole life if you commit now, it will take over.” He was right.I am not intellectual by any stretch of the imagination. For me, getting involved was about fairness. I wanted an equal world. I wanted peace, jobs for all, nuclear disarmament. I wanted feminism, I wanted to abolish racism. I wanted healthy, fair, progressive politics. I might have been naive at 18, but if so I am still naive now. My goals have not changed – I still want that now.I left the Communist party at 21, when I went to London to drama school, for no other reason than that I could not fulfil my commitments to it. But I am still a socialist. I decided that if I was going to be political, it would be through my work. I was always sceptical about the effect that television, theatre and cinema can have, but sometimes you see the impact. Take Three Girls – the BBC miniseries about the Rochdale child sexual abuse ring. People stopped me in the street wanting to talk about it, wanting to ask me questions, not about my character, but about the whole piece, about the grooming scandal, how they felt about it, how the series had changed their attitude.I don’t feel a responsibility as an actor to get people involved in politics – I think that is slightly patronising. My responsibility as an actor is to tell a good story and to play a good part. It depends on the stories you choose to tell. Of course, I am asked about my politics and therefore I am honest about my politics, but I completely understand why other actors do not want to be vocal about these things. That was never in the job description, but it is too much of who I am. I do not go around telling other people how they should feel or think. I am not a Henry Hunt – one of the main characters in Peterloo (played by Rory Kinnear). He was one of the leading orators of the time, who went around the country standing on a box making speeches, wearing his trademark white hat. There was a vanity to him, I suppose, as there is with many politicians, left and right. My grandad used to say: “Politicians, Maxine: frustrated actors.” I will admit it works the other way around sometimes, too.Watching the finished film of Peterloo, you really get an understanding of how impossible it was made for working people to get educated, but people did. They fought tooth and nail for it. They went to seek it out wherever they could, hoovering up knowledge and knowing it is power.To hear the beautiful speeches, political speeches, that the reformers make, at a time when most people were uneducated, is wonderful. Being able to speak that eloquently for that long, with so much knowledge and passion, is something I fear we are losing: that drive, that passion to self-educate. We have had that drummed out of us. Where we are now, it is not possible for hordes of people to go into further education, because of financial restrictions. People do not feel they have any power any more. We have become anaesthetised with debt and fear. We are being constantly bullied into submission.For me, this is about remembering the struggle, the heartache and the sacrifice people made in the past, but it is also about holding up a mirror to where we are now. Peterloo tells you the history of that time, but it also shows you: this could happen again. The costumes may be different, but it is the same old battle against authority, it is the constant disregard of working people, the lack of respect, the systematic bullying. I know people think I am some sort of extremist, but to me we live in a police state and it is getting progressively worse. You only have to look at the many anti-fracking demonstrations in the north where the police used extreme violence against the protesters to see that.I think the film will open people’s eyes. Next year is the 200th anniversary of Peterloo, but the timing of it – it feels as if the planets have aligned. People want change now, like they did then. I still believe that unity is strength. There is still power in mass demonstrations we must never forget that. People say they do not achieve results, but for me it is not always about being successful. It is about stemming the flow. It is about getting under the skin. It is about saying: “We’re here and we don’t agree.” If we stop standing up and shouting, we will be in a very sorry situation.As told to Steve Rose.

That “cheeky” chain, Nando’s, has been described as “one of the most successful cults in Britain”, having carved itself an unlikely, but undeniable niche in our national identity. In perhaps the ultimate sign of its success, piri piri has now been added to the list of dubious attractions at my local Texan fried chicken shop, too. It seems we just can’t get enough spicy grilled poultry.Popularity, however, breeds contempt – and, even leaving aside questions of animal welfare, not all this piri piri has the vim and vinegar of the salty, sizzling stuff shoved through the hatch of your average Lisbon kiosk or churrascaria. Fortunately, however, if you can grill chicken, you can make much better piri piri chicken at home.The name piri piri comes from the variety of chilli used, a cultivar of Capsicum frutescens, which also includes tabasco chillies, probably taken by the Portuguese from their colonies in South America to those in Africa and, from there, to Europe. In Swahili, pili pili apparently means pepper-pepper – prompting the witticism “the chilli so hot they named it twice” – and it lives up to that reputation. The fruit registers 50,000-175,000 Scoville units (a measurement based on the amount of sugared water necessary to neutralise its fire), qualifying it for the “very hot” category in Kay Plunkett-Hogge’s book Heat, one below pure capsaicin (16m units, and “explosive!”).However, piri piri, while hot, aren’t particularly distinctively flavoured if the dried fruit I buy are anything to go by, so Plunkett-Hogge’s recommendation to substitute the similarly pungent (50,000-100,000 Scoville), easily available Thai bird’s eye chillies seems a good one. That said, given the heat is the important thing, so long as you stick with ripe red chillies, you can use just about any piquant variety you like.Add them to taste, as Seal suggests, bearing in mind that “the fieriness of the paste will be weakened by cooking, so go for slightly more heat than you think you like”.Seal’s recipe also includes red bell peppers, presumably as much for their colour as flavour, giving her piri piri a pleasing sweetness that goes down well with testers as a sauce, yet lacks the fire of some of the other versions. Again, that’s not necessarily a problem: according to Taste of Lisboa food tours: “We don’t even like spicy food that much. Yes, there is the possibility to order roasted chicken with spicy sauce, but most of the people don’t order the sauce and prefer to accompany chicken with fries.” In the UK, of course, we like both.Even more popular than the red pepper, however, is the brick-red paprika used by Tessa Kiros in her book Piri Piri Starfish, and by Stein and Phipps, whose choice of sweet and smoky is particularly useful if climatic conditions preclude barbecuing the meat. Those deploying a milder variety of fresh chilli might prefer to go for the hot sort instead: it’s up to you.This is a spicy, rather than a herby dish. My testers don’t think the oregano used by Henry, Phipps, Stein and Kiros adds that much once the heat is ramped up, and the same goes for Kiros’s bay leaf. Both would get lost in my fiery sauce, but may prove more welcome in milder versions.Similarly, the bold flavour of garlic is preferred to Phipps’s milder sauteed onion, but then, her sauce – based on the African Volcano range by South African chef Grant Hawthorne – is quite a different beast from the rest: a smoky, tomatoey, almost chutney-like affair that ends with a real kick. Hawthorne tells me that his recipe is based on one from Beira in Mozambique, and helpfully adds that west African versions use cumin and ginger, while ex-Portuguese colonies often include vinho verde as well as citrus for a sharper flavour. The testers absolutely love it as an accompaniment, but we all find its complex flavours get a bit lost in the cooking process, while simpler, sour and spicy marinades such as Mendes’s still shine as brightly as ever.Sharpness is one of the key qualities in most piri piri sauces, usually added in the form of lemon juice or wine vinegar – I prefer the cleaner flavour of the former, but either will do, and you may also like to add a little balancing sweetness, in the guise of sugar, as Henry, Phipps and Stein do, or port, as Kiros does. The latter feels pleasingly apt to me, but only if you have a bottle open: it doesn’t make enough difference to merit a special purchase – unless you’re looking for an excuse, of course.Mendes adds a whole lemon to his piri piri paste, which gives it a very distinctive, though not unpleasant, bitter zestiness that completely overpowers the chilli. Interesting, but not as universally popular as the crisps he suggests as an accompaniment.In Portugal, whole spatchcocked chickens are popular, but they tend to be smaller than can easily be found in the UK (Kiros calls for 800g birds the closest I can find is 1.2kg). As meatier breasts tend to dry out over a high heat, I’m going to go with Seal’s whole legs instead – although Stein’s large thighs are as delicious as you might have imagined in your most secret dreams, and the wings, which I don’t try, would be perfect for a party situation.Seal and Phipps marinate their chicken overnight in piri piri, Mendes leaves it for two hours, Kiros adds the sauce to the chicken for the last few minutes of cooking, and Stein doesn’t slosh it on until the meat is off the heat entirely. Stein’s method has the benefit of keeping the skin super-crisp, but it lacks the charred chilli flavour of the others. Kiros’s method feels like the best compromise – long enough for a spot of charring, short enough to keep the flavours fresh.Like Stein, she marinates the meat in lemon juice, garlic and salt first, as would be traditional in a Portuguese churrascaria, I believe. This gives it an addictive flavour without any risk of burning on the grill, a few flecks of garlic aside. However, Harold McGee has written that there’s no point in leaving it in this acidic bath for more than two hours, telling the LA Times that: “Any longer than that, and the meat will have a kind of mealy stuff on the surface. The structured meat tissue becomes tiny protein particles – fine for a paté, but not what you want in a steak” – or, indeed, grilled chicken.Mendes and Kiros both use large amounts of butter in their sauce, giving the finished dish a richness, but also tempering the heat. This prompts me to use olive oil instead, though you may prefer to go down their route. Some recipes also include whisky or brandy for preservation purposes, but unless you’re planning on keeping the sauce for a while, it doesn’t add much to the flavour.The barbecue is ideal for this purpose, but you can also get excellent results in the oven, as Stein recommends. I prefer to finish them off in a hot griddle pan rather than under the grill, which I find fiddly and more work to clean up.Serve with chips and lemon wedges if you want to go Portuguese, though it’s also very nice indeed with rice to soak up the extra sauce. Or, in Mendes’s style, freshly fried potato crisps – I have it on reliable authority that a bag from the supermarket also does the trick.4 chicken legs (thigh and drumstick), skin on, bone inFor the marinadeJuice of ½ lemon4 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed2 tsp flaky saltFor the piri piri sauce2-4 red African or Thai bird’s eye chillies, to taste2 plump garlic cloves, peeledJuice of 1 lemon1½ tsp flaky salt2 tsp sweet smoked paprika50ml olive oil1 tbsp port or 1 tsp brown sugar (optional)Whisk together the lemon juice and garlic for the marinade.

Sprinkle with the salt, cover and leave at room temperature (unless it’s a very hot day) for an hour.Meanwhile, roughly chop two chillies (gloves are advisable) and the garlic, add the lemon juice and salt, and whizz to a puree (or mash well in a mortar). Whisk in the paprika and oil. Taste, adding more chilli if you think it needs it, and the port or sugar if you’d prefer it a bit sweeter.Prepare the barbecue, if using. Once it’s at cooking temperature, grill the chicken for 35 minutes with the lid on, then check. If it’s almost done, then brush with piri piri and cook, lid off, for about another 10 minutes, until cooked through.Alternatively, heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6 and roast the chicken for about 35 minutes, until cooked through, basting with its juices occasionally. Heat a griddle pan to medium hot, brush the chicken with piri piri, and grill for a few minutes on each side, until just starting to char.Either way, serve hot with the extra sauce on the side.• Piri piri chicken: do you prefer the Portuguese version or the African originals – and does Nando’s make a decent fist of it?

His coaching qualifications include the FA advanced youth award and he is described as a popular figure at the club.However, the news of another possible investigation involving Crewe will be another blow to the club’s troubled reputation at a time when Dario Gradi, their director of football, has not returned to work since being suspended by the FA in December 2016.Crewe had initially hoped to keep the investigation relating to Everall as an in-house matter but when the  contacted the club on Wednesday the chairman, John Bowler, instigated high-level talks with his colleagues and a statement was released. “You will appreciate that it is not appropriate for us to comment in detail at this time,” it said. “I can, however, confirm that all relevant and appropriate procedures have been followed.”Gradi, who has been at Crewe since 1983, including 24 years and more than 1,200 games as manager, was ordered to stay away from football while the relevant authorities investigated his specific role in what the FA’s chairman, Greg Clarke, has described as the biggest crisis he can remember in the sport.It was Gradi, who has an MBE for his services to football, that employed Barry Bennell, the youth-team coach who was sent to prison for 30 years in February for raping and molesting boys in the junior systems of Crewe and Manchester City. Bennell, described as an “industrial-scale child molester”, is waiting to hear whether the Crown Prosecution Service is to press more charges relating to some of the other complainants. As of January, at least 97 people – though possibly more now – had reported Bennell to the police on the back of the interview Andy Woodward gave to the  in November 2016, detailing the years of abuse he suffered in the club’s youth system.What was never made clear was whether Gradi’s suspension related to anything that had happened at Crewe, or if it went back to claims that in his coaching days at Chelsea he visited the house of a 15-year-old youth-team player to “smooth over” a complaint of sexual assault against Eddie Heath, the chief scout who has been identified as a repeat offender in the 1970s.Clive Sheldon, the QC who is undertaking the FA-commissioned independent inquiry into football’s sexual-abuse scandal, announced last month that it was being delayed indefinitely, largely because of the possibility that Bennell could face another criminal trial. Manchester City and Chelsea have been holding their own inquiries but Crewe’s decision that one was not necessary at Gresty Road, having initially promised a full investigation, has attracted widespread condemnation from Bennell’s victims and dismayed the relevant authorities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592e2797777fc4138a3814a4f5267b4bfec124e5/26_156_1871_1123/master/1871.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8f8074f8d8299fb15c348949dced1dc","title":"manchester united takeover tale wrong saudi arabia","story":"Even in dark times, the idealism of some football fans remains a beautiful thing to behold. Suggestions over the past week that the Glazer family were considering selling Manchester United to a certain party were greeted with delight in various quarters. As one United supporter positively willing the deal to happen put it: “We deserve better”. Better, in this case, would be Saudi prince Mohammed bin Salman, a man whom journalistic cliche demands we style as “in the news for all the wrong reasons”. But hey – nobody’s perfect.That was where we were by Monday afternoon, as shares in the club rose significantly on Wall Street as rumours of a takeover “swirled”. I say the cobblers was “surfaced by” the Daily Star, because the notion that the Saudis might be about to buy United seems to have originated in the even more tenuously-informed corners of the internet rumour mill. The claim’s first appearance in what we might solemnly refer to as legacy media was on the Star’s website on 12 October, which stated that United fans had “blitzed social media to welcome claims” that the club might be sold to MBS.Still, where we’re going, we don’t need likes, because we have SEO aggregation. In fairly short order, papers from the Sun to the Express to the  to the Mail had taken up the tale – reports which were then noted by the BBC’s John Simpson. Is there a point at which there are so many reports about something for which there is no apparent evidence that SEO aggregation makes the story magically true? Not really, alas – though someone probably needs to point that out to United’s share price.In the absence of any facts, or even quotes from anonymous sources, media outlets were forced to look for ways in which to pad out a story which they may or may not have realised was pretty much sourceable to internet randos. Luckily, there are various twos and twos out of which five could be made. Last year, for instance, Manchester United committed to a memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia, in which the club agreed to help the country develop its football industry. Signing this historic accord, United managing director Richard Arnold declared: “The club has a longstanding relationship with Saudi Arabia.” Richard probably won’t be shouting much about that from the rooftops in the current climate, but back then he was keen to point out that “our partnership with Saudi Telecom is the longest running of all our commercial partners”. Well quite. United aren’t some Johnny-come-latelies – they were partnering with the Saudis 10 years before women were even allowed into football stadiums in the country.Back in the present day, meanwhile, the takeover stories continued to demand fuel. Much was made of the fact that Avram Glazer is flying to Saudi Arabia this week, for a conference at which he had been long scheduled to speak. This was judged to be “fuelling talk” of a takeover of the club by his Saudi hosts. As for why the takeover was a thing that might happen, that was simple. “It’s been claimed the wealthy Middle Eastern country are keen to buy the Old Trafford club from current owners the Glazer family,” noted the Daily Star, who by now appeared to be stepping away from the fact they were essentially the ones who’d been doing the claiming. “It’s said Saudi investors are keen to ersify their investments away from oil – and see football powerhouse United as a good option.” Interesting financial planning, there. I’m not sure precisely how many barrels a day of Victor Lindelöf #content the Saudis would need to produce to consider it a credible ersification from being an effing petrostate, but it is believed to be Quite A Lot.So that’s where we’re at. Are the Saudis buying Manchester United? On this evidence – or rather, this lack of evidence – the answer is surely no. Still, perhaps the kingdom is grateful for even the small distraction such stories provide. Indeed, it is a testament to the hermetically sealed world of football news that barely any of these accounts made mention of the main reason Bin Salman’s Saudi Arabia has been all over the news (and SEO aggregators) for many days. Namely, the disappearance and suspected torture and murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi embassy in Istanbul. As we know, football is much more serious than a matter of life and death. But if the past week is anything to go by, filling the football pages is five points more serious still."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/059ae79c78432cc13e3d0ee865440cb2e7ed1d32/69_34_1270_762/master/1270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c329565dcc0efb5154333410119c6eb","title":"bleak future premier league basement huddersfield newcastle cardiff football","story":"There is a certain symmetry about the Premier League table at the moment. Three teams at the top are still unbeaten, and already it is being suggested that the title will end up at Manchester City, Chelsea or Liverpool, even though Arsenal should perhaps not be discounted.At the bottom, three teams are without a win after eight games, the first time in the Premier League era that this has happened. Already it is being suggested that Huddersfield, Newcastle and Cardiff are as good as relegated, even if Fulham and Southampton are not exactly accelerating up the table away from the danger zone.While it is clearly unsafe to make predictions at this stage, the stats for the bottom three sides make particularly grim reading. With just two points after eight matches Cardiff and Newcastle are averaging a quarter of a point per game. It is generally accepted that a side looking to escape relegation needs to be earning around a point per game so as to be in sight of 37-40 points at the end of the season, and if they cannot improve on their present rate both the bottom two clubs are on course to rival Derby County’s dismal 11-point record from the 2007-08 season. If they do not start winning soon they will probably lose too much ground to make up in the second part of the season.Huddersfield are scarcely any better. Although the Terriers have one point more than the two teams below them they have scored only four goals and their sole clean sheet came when similarly stricken Cardiff visited West Yorkshire in August. Derby managed 20 goals in their nightmare season of setting Premier League lows, and with two clubs averaging one goal every other game that record may also be in danger.So is it the case that the gulf in standards between Championship and Premier League has grown too wide to be bridged? Are the days of adventure and upward mobility for smallish clubs such as Bournemouth, Burnley and Wigan over?It cannot be as simple as that, otherwise Wolves would not be sitting in seventh position, a promoted side lording it for the moment over established names such as Manchester United and Everton. Yet maybe Wolves are a one-off they won last season’s Championship by nine points, after all, and in the football they play and the quality of player they have attracted they cannot be regarded as top-flight tourists destined to spend a season looking around.Cardiff might fit that description more closely, with Neil Warnock admitting he would not be surprised to be sacked before Christmas, though the Welsh club is presently the only promoted club in the bottom three. Fulham may soon be joining them if some glaring defensive deficiencies cannot be addressed, but Newcastle and Huddersfield were around last season, with the same playing squads and managers. Newcastle finished 10th in 2017-18, a more than satisfactory achievement for such an unstable and capricious club, and in Rafael Benítez they certainly have a manager capable of making the most of scant resources. Of course it is a pity that a manager of Benítez’s pedigree is still having to do that, a wonder that he continues to put up patiently with such an unhelpful situation and a scandal that such an impressive football institution cannot find anyone at boardroom level to match the enthusiasm of the fans, but we are where we are and Newcastle are second from bottom.Benítez said before the international break that he did not think his side would go down. No one watching their last performance at Old Trafford would have disagreed, and after playing Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham in their first eight games, Newcastle have a run of ostensibly easier fixtures to try to elevate their lowly league position. The next month or so brings games against Brighton, Southampton, Watford, Bournemouth and Burnley, and while none of those could remotely be described as a gimme, Newcastle supporters should have a much clearer idea of their chances of survival by December.Cardiff and Huddersfield have to play Liverpool in the next 10 days, though Fulham visit the bottom club on Saturday in what has to be regarded as a must-win game for Warnock and his players. Victory by more than a single goal would see Cardiff climb above Slavisa Jokanovic’s side – that is how fluid the situation at the bottom can be with only three points separating five sides – though rather than contemplating such a giddy rise supporters in south Wales are probably more worried about what might happen if the result goes against them.Fulham, after a reasonably bright start, are beginning to conform to the unwritten rule that says the club coming up via the play-offs tends to struggle in the top flight, though at least they can take heart from the fact that last season’s Championship runners-up are struggling more.Aside from a brief period early last season, Huddersfield have rarely looked like a viable Premier League unit. They faded badly after picking up 15 points from their first 11 games, and though they kept going and managed to save themselves with a couple of matches to spare, things might have been a lot tighter if Swansea, Stoke and West Bromhad not endured such dreadful seasons.The fact that three established Premier League teams went down last season is probably what is unusual here. It meant the three promoted sides stayed up, for a start, when in a more normal season perhaps one or two of them might have made a quick return. The upshot is that the present top flight contains at least four sides who might be more at home in the Championship, and Wolves are not among them. While the finishing order remains uncertain, it is beginning to look as though two of the relegation positions might be filled long before the end of the season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01202a8b321fd04981055a49e9df1ee94c58ca35/1273_283_2723_1634/master/2723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fbb08e0c816491d451514c59a790622","title":"golden goal john barnes for liverpool v qpr 1987","story":"Barnes epitomised the tag of ‘flying winger’ in the late-80s and never more so than with the nimble footwork that rounded off a 4-0 win to replace QPR at the top of the tableThe spreadsheet is the new diary. Modern life is defined as much by numbers as feelings. Likes, retweets, calories, steps, pints. Yet there is no metric for euphoria, at least not yet, and so the richest human experiences are largely data-proof. Love, the arts, the humble orgasm – or its football equivalent. Few things in life compare to the moment when you – or more likely your team – score a goal of such brilliance or importance that you instantly know its memory will last forever.On a basic level, goals are easy to quantify. Team goal: number of passes. Screamer: distance from goal. Solo goal: defenders beaten. But that’s a flawed, soulless enterprise. Don’t count the passes, especially if the first 20 are under no pressure whatsoever from the Serbia \u0026amp Montenegro defence feel the crescendo of the move instead. Don’t count how many defenders a player beats look at how they do it, and when. Most of all, marvel at the things which makes solo goals so magical: the skill, the audacity and especially the balance.Balance is a dribbler’s God-given friend, the thing which allows them to ride tackles or swerve left and right like a human F1 car. We know it when we see it, yet it’s a hard thing to fully understand. Apart from the use of simple adjectives – beautiful is the usual choice – it’s hard to find words for it. And it’s impossible to find data. We know great balance when we see it, though. Think of Diego Maradona staggering away from the scene of his genius against Belgium in 1986, George Best staying on his feet after being run over by Chopper Harris, or John Barnes twisting imperiously through QPR at Anfield in 1987.Although Barnes only beat two players, he prefers this to his famous goal against Brazil at the Maracana (four defenders and the keeper, since you asked). As well as its superior quality, Barnes’s goal endures because of its symbolic significance. The Brazil moment was a one-off, for him and England, whereas the QPR goal confirmed something brilliant was happening – that, after a dismal run of only one league title in three seasons, Liverpool were not only back but better than ever. It also completed Barnes’s rapid journey from unreliable outsider to darling of the Kop.The match, 31 years ago today, was quite the big deal. Challengers v Challengers in the parlance of 2018 second v first in the language of 1987. QPR, the league leaders, who were having enormous success with their revolutionary tactics – a sweeper, man-markers and, most shockingly of all, patient possession football. The match was even going to be televised, sort of. In 1987-88, non-live football was an event. These were the first highlights from any top-ision match in almost two months. (There wasn’t even a full Match of the Day – it was part of Sports Special.)Liverpool, who had to postpone some early home games because of the collapse of a sewer beneath the Kop, were three points behind Rangers with two games in hand, with the champions Everton in eighth. They had started the season spectacularly, and more than 3,000 fans were locked out when the gates were closed 35 minutes before kick-off. Ian Rush, who had joined Juventus in the summer, was back to see whether reports of Liverpool’s resurgence had been even remotely exaggerated.They had not. “They are a better team than the one I left behind,” purred Rush. The match was pretty close for an hour, but eventually Liverpool’s class and desire overwhelmed Rangers. Barnes created the opening goal for Craig Johnston, took a free-kick which was handled in the box, giving John Aldridge a chance from the spot, and then scored twice with his right foot to complete a devastating 4-0 victory.It was the fourth consecutive league game in which Liverpool had scored four goals. Their fans were used to winning, but not like this. They knew they were watching easily their most exciting team since 1978-79, probably ever.Barnes’s second goal was certainly without precedent. It started when he did his own dirty work by winning the ball off Kevin Brock near the halfway line. From there he surged unchallenged towards the edge of the area, where Alan McDonald and Terry Fenwick were waiting like a pair of bouncers. Barnes approached them with the preparatory stride of a hurdler, which is exactly what he needed to be when McDonald lunged at him. At that moment instinct took over, and everything slowed down.The ability of great players to calculate so much in a split second is endlessly fascinating, and challenges the view that footballers lack intelligence. Barnes’s reactions were fast enough for him to touch the ball to the left, away from goal, and gracefully avoid McDonald’s challenge in the same movement. His brain was even faster. As he jumped, Barnes registered in his peripheral vision that Fenwick, partially distracted by an off-the-ball run from Peter Beardsley, had left a small gap on the inside.Barnes, whose body was facing towards the corner flag, then started to change direction in mid-bloody-air. As he landed he guided the ball back inside Fenwick to move through on goal. Even the weight of the touch was perfect – heavy enough to take Fenwick out of the game but not so heavy as to bring the covering defender Paul Parker or the goalkeeper David Seaman into it. Having beaten both McDonald and Fenwick in one impossibly smooth movement, the finish was an orgiastic formality.There’s an extraordinary amount going on in the space of two or three seconds, but it’s Barnes’s balance and mid-air twist which elevate the goal into the realms of genius. He gave new meaning to the phrase “flying winger”. Try it at home if you like, but know first that  Media Group accepts no legal responsibility for pulled muscles, shattered coffee tables or accidental death.Wingers are supposed to leave defenders with twisted blood, not themselves. Barnes’s balance was even more impressive because of his build. Most great dribblers are short, skinny or both. Barnes was just shy of six foot, weighed 12 stone and had thighs that could kill a man. That gives his goal a unique elegance. It wasn’t football, it was foot-ballet.The QPR goal made Barnes a Liverpool idol, which was unlikely a few months earlier. His move to Anfield was so protracted – he was in love with Serie A and originally wanted to go to Milan or Juventus – that there was a hostile attitude towards him when he arrived. Oh, and he was black. Dave Hill’s staggering Out of His Skin covers this in detail, but the extent of the racism is pretty astonishing. There were various neanderthal insights daubed on the stadium walls, including “LIVERPOOL ARE WHITE” and “NO WOGS ALLOWED”. When Barnes first went to Anfield, one of the staff served everyone a cup of tea except him. “What,” said Barnes, “am I black or something?”Barnes thinks he would have been booed on his home debut had the sewer not burst. Instead, word got back from the hardcore away support about his performances by the time he made a spectacular home debut against Oxford in mid-September, the mood had softened. When he scored those goals against QPR, it melted. For his first four seasons at Anfield, where he received a freedom and an affection he didn’t get with England, Barnes was awesome.His goal was part of a legendary portfolio. In 1987-88, the BBC’s Goal of the Season was made up entirely of those scored by Liverpool players. Even in Liverpool’s greatest team, Barnes stood out. He won the PFA and FWA Player of the Year awards, scored 15 league goals and produced moments of skill that blew the mind. In Out of His Skin, Hill picks out one abracadabra turn against Everton that left Peter Reid eating mud and Gary Stevens in a different postcode. Until YouTube, it had the mythical quality of a great bootleg album.The QPR game was, because of the BBC highlights, an instant classic. “Our performance was astonishing,” said Barnes in his autobiography. “The memory of that match burns more vividly in my mind than any other I played for Liverpool.”You can’t put that sort of feeling on a spreadsheet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5179c5db75738919586821269903acb846d74523/0_298_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b17bc01ae5605cdcd6105935abbce511","title":"the coming of the mine separated us a community split in south africa","story":"Poverty, conservation and industry are at loggerheads in the eastern town of SomkheleDrive for an hour into the hills that lie behind South Africa’s wild eastern coast, and you will find a game park full of rhino and big cats, a sprawling town spread over dozens of summits and dry valleys, and a vast opencast coal mine.If all the advantages of the rainbow nation – stunning landscape and wildlife, massive mineral resources and a youthful population – are represented here, then so too are all its problems.Somkhele is home to tens of thousands of people living in rudimentary houses on parched patches of land, many of whom would be entirely destitute without monthly welfare payments of less than £20.Within a 15-minute drive, there is Hluhluwe–Imfolozi, the oldest nature reserve in Africa, where hundreds of rhinos, antelope and big cats graze under the wondering gaze of tourists. In between lie the rubble and workings of the opencast mine.The tensions between the three are now reaching a critical point. The mining company wants to dig out more coal, and has been granted rights for a vast new swath of land. Activists in Somkhele have gone to court to shut the mine, or at least stop any expansion, which mining officials say would have the same result. A judgment is due within weeks and will set a precedent that could have far-reaching consequences.“If the judge finds against us, he is saying mining companies in South Africa don’t have to comply with the law, and that is terrifying. If he finds for us, he says the law in this country is to be respected by everybody,” said Kirsten Youens, a lawyer acting for community groups in Somkhele.Jan du Preez, CEO of Petmin, the company which owns the Somkhele mine, said its operations were fully compliant with all legal requirements, and accused critics of being activists who hate mining.“It would be wonderful if the world could obtain its raw materials with zero harm, but that is in utopia,” Du Preez told the .“While the world needs environmental activists to protect against unscrupulous people, these activists also need to … actually consider the facts. Unfortunately some are idealists who would rather have a devastated economy and no jobs than a responsibly run mine. ”Across South Africa, and across the continent, there are similar confrontations as officials come under pressure to ensure economic growth – even at the cost of the environment.Thulziwe Jane Dladla, who lives in a traditional cluster of small houses and huts overlooking the Somkhele mine, listed her grievances: dust, noise and ground-shaking blasting, heavy truck traffic, inadequate compensation for households relocated and a lack of communication since mining began a little over a decade ago.“Life here is too bad,” she said.Officials at the mine, which produces rare and valuable anthracite coal used in the metal industry, say none of these complaints is justified and point out benefits to the community including more than a thousand jobs, a maternity ward for the local clinic, roads, water pipes, a school, a creche and training programmes.Du Preez said fair compensation was paid to displaced families, with the costs of moving graves of ancestors also covered by the company.The community’s traditional leaders, elected municipal officials and the mining union’s local branches almost unanimously back the mine. So too, it appears, does the government. Last month, Gwede Mantashe, minister for mineral resources, travelled to Somkhele and the site of another controversial mine, Xolobeni, where an Australian company has been trying to mine titanium, to rally support.The African National Congress, in power since South Africa’s first free elections in 1994, believe such developments will give a much-needed boost to the country’s flagging economy.But Mantashe’s trip was not a success. In Somkhele, he angered some locals by leaving them waiting for several hours before a brief meeting. In Xolobeni, his visit ended in disorder, with teargas fired by police to disperse demonstrators and a well-known environmental lawyer arrested.“The minister was disrespectful,” said Bongani Pearce, one of the Somkhele activists. “The government isn’t on our side.”Dladla, 56, admitted the community was split, with some welcoming the opportunities the mine has brought in an area where jobs are rare, especially for young people. It is these isions that pain her most.“We were a community gathering together. But the coming of the mine separated us,” she said.Activists claim that Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president since February, is biased. The liberation struggle leader turned multimillionaire businessman made a fortune in mining before returning to politics.“They are all on the side of the mines. They don’t care about small people like us,” said Dladla.ANC officials dismiss the charge as ridiculous. They argue that South Africa is still desperately poor and cannot afford to ignore the earning potential of its resources. If mining has shrunk as a proportion of GDP, the industry has long been central to the party’s plans to empower and enrich the country’s majority communities.Melissa Fourie, executive director of the Centre for Environmental Rights, said the approach was short-term.“Mining shouldn’t be seen as the solution to all problems. The government needs to be more creative in its thinking. We don’t have to destroy precious natural resources for ever,” she added.But the ANC is under pressure. Elections are due next year, and calls for rapid and radical economic transformation from populists like Julius Malema and his Economic Freedom Fighters party resonate with the millions who feel that the prosperity and equality promised when the racist apartheid regime crumbled are unfulfilled.“I don’t like the EFF’s strategy and all the confrontation, but I hear what they are saying and it makes sense,” said Dladla’s 25-year-old son, who has moved to the city of Durban, 140 miles (225km) away, to find work.With massive debts and limited revenue opportunities, ruling party officials are also desperate for foreign investment.One potential source is China, which recently promised investment of more than $1.1bn (£830m) in industrial infrastructure and plants, including a big coal mine in the north-east and a 4600MW coal-fired power station.Experts say renewable energy sources now offer a cheaper way to supply South Africa’s power needs, and would avoid extensive environmental damage.Some Somkhele inhabitants fear the coming judgement may exacerbate existing isions.“If we lose, the whole community will be torn apart. There will not be peace. There will be disorder,” said Duduzile Mkhwanazi, 36, a local farmer and mother of three.“But it is important. It is a start for us, a beginning. I don’t want my kids to grow up without jobs or schooling, but I don’t want them to grow up next to a mine either.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c76e45e0954fd9069421b1f96822dc1ebc9353d2/9_28_2508_1505/master/2508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1796effcf7e2ff363c9921b117af9bb","title":"pmqs verdict theresa may gets off lighter than she deserved","story":"Jeremy Corbyn had one excellent question but his failure to follow up cost himJeremy Corbyn kicked off a very noisy PMQs this week by paying tribute to Patricia Hollis, the Labour peer who died this week.He then asked Theresa May, given that she did not mention either Chequers in her conference speech or in the Commons on Monday, did it mean the Chequers plan was dead. May, who joined the Hollis tribute, replied: “The answer is no.”Corbyn said Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey had both refused to back Chequers. Maybe she could share a pizza with them and sort it out.A backstop is required to ensure there is no hard border in Ireland if a comprehensive free trade deal cannot be signed before the end of 2020. Theresa May has proposed to the EU that the whole of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit, but Brussels has said it needs more time to evaluate the proposal. As a result, the EU insists on having its own backstop - the backstop to the backstop - which would mean Northern Ireland would remain in the single market and customs union in the absence of a free trade deal, prompting fierce objections from Conservative hard Brexiters and the DUP, which props up her government. That prompted May to propose a country-wide alternative in which the whole of the UK would remain in parts of the customs union after Brexit. “The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs. Raising the stakes, the prime minister said the EU’s insistence amounted to a threat to the constitution of the UK: “We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom,” she added.Corbyn’s next question referred to reports that Philip Hammond believes the UK may still have to pay most of a £39bn Brexit “orce bill” if there is no deal. May said the UK honoured its obligations. But nothing was agreed until everything was agreed.Corbyn asked May to confirm that the joint report she signed with the EU committed the UK to an Irish backstop without a time limit.May said the UK had said the backstop was to bridge the gap between the end of the implementation period and the future relationship coming into force. Corbyn said May signed an agreement with no time limit attached. Did she still stand by that?He said the car industry was clear it needed a new customs union to ensure continued investment in manufacturing. Jobs were at risk. Why wouldn’t May back a customs union to back jobs?May said the frictionless trade carmakers wanted was at the heart of her plan. Her plan would deliver on the referendum decision. Labour would not do that. It wanted a second referendum.Corbyn said Jaguar Land Rover was holding off investment until it knew what would happen. He said the public accounts committee said last week the Department of Health could not guarantee the supply of medicines after Brexit.May said Corbyn was talking about a no-deal scenario. The Department of Health was preparing for this.Corbyn said, according to the BMA the UK was woefully underprepared for this. The Tories had spent two years arguing with themselves over it. They were still bickering. They were too weak and too ided to protect jobs or the economy. So May had a choice. She could continue to put the Tory party first. Or she could put the interests of the country first.May said Corbyn had said nothing about the unemployment figures out this week. She listed government achievements: scrapping the cap on council spending on homes, freezing fuel duty, low unemployment, wages rising. Labour could play politics the Conservatives delivered for the people.It was a creditable performance from Corbyn but, with one exception, his questions did not really put May under much pressure, and it is hard to see either of them deserving credit for a resounding victory.Corbyn focused all his questions on Brexit, but he asked about six, quite separate topics and, although all his questions were pertinent (and shorter than usual, it sounded to me, which was welcome), May brushed them aside fairly easily.If you can’t get past the shield with the first question, you need a well-directed follow-up, but Corbyn has never been good at these and so this was an exchange marked by lost opportunities.May claimed Chequers was still policy. So can she promise MPs that she will only sign a deal that preserves all its elements? Or is she even willing to say the word out loud?And May says nothing is agreed on the Brexit bill until everything is agreed. So can she assure Tory Brexiters that, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will pay nothing? (She can’t, because the UK would pay up, but she is loth to say so with Jacob Rees-Mogg in the room.)Corbyn’s best moment came when he asked May why she signed up to the Irish backstop in the December joint report agreed between the EU and the UK without insisting on a time limit. This is an excellent question because the only honest answer (“we were up against a deadline and we didn’t think it through”) won’t wash, and May sounded a little panicky as she waffled her way through her rather feeble answer. Six questions on this would have had her floundering badly. But Corbyn never pressed the point, and so May got off more lightly than she deserved.When Corbyn refers to Mordaunt and McVey’s doubts about Chequers, he gets in a dig about Brexiter MPs meeting for a pizza to discuss May’s plan:Maybe she could share a pizza with them and see if they can sort it out.There will be no second referendum.

She’s had a reply, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports, and the Bank will provide a report for MPs.Theresa May has arrived in Brussels.Her handshake with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, didn’t last long, the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg reports.John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has been speaking at a press gallery lunch today. My colleague Pippa Crerar has some of the highlights.Jeremy’s view is that the issue of Brexit and the issue of bullying, harassment and abuse in parliament, or any work place, are entirely separate, and shouldn’t be confused in any way.The spokesman also said Thornberry was expressing a “personal view” yesterday, not speaking on behalf of the party. He clarified Corbyn’s position after a 24 hours which saw Labour criticised for appearing to rank Brexit as more important than addressing bullying and harassment. (See, for example, this column from the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush.) Yesterday, when Corbyn’s office was asked about Thornberry’s comments, and whether they reflected Corbyn or the party’s position, aides refused to address the question, suggesting that Corbyn has firmed up his views overnight.Bercow has been accused of bullying staff but it is important to stress that he denies those allegations. However he has also been criticised for presiding over a Commons administration where such behaviour by MPs has been tolerated.Universal credit, the government’s flagship social security programme, has been beset with flaws in its design and delivery. It’s causing immense hardship for many people wherever it is rolled out. It is hard to believe now but UC was designed to lift people out of poverty and smooth the transition into work to ensure that it always pays. The reality is that UC is a vehicle for cuts.Angela Merkel has admitted for the first time that the German government is making contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit.The German chancellor said that her government had started to make “suitable preparations” for the possibility of Britain and the EU failing to reach a final agreement.“It is only fitting as a responsible and forward-thinking government leadership, that we prepare for every scenario - that includes the possibility of Great Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement. In the government we have begun to prepare ourselves appropriately for this,” she told German parliamentarians in a special address, dubbed her “Big Brexit Speech” by the German media, ahead of the European council meeting in Brussels on Wednesday.Merkel then breathlessly reeled off a list of her concerns, from citizens’ rights to customs issues, that she said, despite Michel Barnier’s reassurance that “90 per cent of the text of the exit agreement has been completed”, still remained unresolved. (See 1.46pm.)Merkel described the negotiations with Britain as having been intensive and demonstrating good will on both sides, despite what she called the “unfortunate” lack of breakthrough over the Irish border question. To applause from MPs, she added she wished that Britain, which had “helped shape the EU, politically, economically and culturally” would continue to be a “close and trustworthy partner”. But she added that it had to be clear to all sides, that once out of the EU, Britain could not expect to have the same rights as EU members. “There always needs to be and there will be, a difference between having membership of the European Union and a partnership with the European Union as a third party,” she said.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, addressed the German parliament today about Brexit. Here are the key points she made.And here are extracts from what Merkel said.In one central question, the question of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, there is as yet unfortunately no breakthrough. We’re not just talking here about the integrity of the single market, but the preservation of the Good Friday agreement which ended violence on the island 20 years ago. Everyone who’s ever been involved in international negotiations knows that the most difficult part comes towards the end and the devil here lies very much in the detail, and that’s why we’re now down to talking about our principles, and the joint position of the 27, to work on a convincing solution for both sides.The chances of reaching in time a good and viable exit agreement is still there ...At the same time, it is only fitting as a responsible and forward-thinking government leadership that we prepare for every scenario, that includes the possibility of Great Britain leaving the European Union without an agreement. We have begun in the government to prepare ourselves appropriately for this.In the negotiations with Great Britain on these and other issues it must always be clear, that, even if we want to avoid hardships at the end, there always needs to, and will be, a difference between having membership of the European Union and a partnership with the European Union as a third party. This morning Jon Thompson, the head of HM Revenue and Customs, told MPs that he did not know what the French would do in the event of a no deal Brexit, and what checks would be imposed on lorries entering France from the UK. (See 10.52am.)But the French government has provided an answer, in the form of draft emergency legislation explaining what would happen in the event of a no deal. Sky’s Faisal Islam has posted a link to it.And my colleague Kim Willsher has posted a long and very useful thread on Twitter about what it says. It starts here.And here are extracts.UPDATE: A reader has been in touch to say the French government first unveiled this draft legislation earlier this month.

(I monitor it from the TV in the office, and so I can’t tell. You get a better view in the gallery.) Labour’s Chris Bryant says the same.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, asked about Brexit in his questions.He said it was in everyone’s interests for the PM to come back from Brussels with a good deal. The SNP would act “as a constructive opposition”, he said. “The enemy is behind her.” He said Sir John Major yesterday Brexit would leave the UK poorer. He asked if May agreed.Theresa May said the plan she had put forward would protect jobs and livelihoods.Blackford said: “People’s jobs would be put at risk.” Those were May’s words in June 2016, he said. He said no PM should negotiate a deal what would threaten jobs. He told her to go to Brussels, act in the interests of all citizens and negotiate to keep the UK in the single market and the customs union. “That will command a majority in the House of Commons,” he said.

The study by the anti-fascism advocacy group, “sets out to understand the drivers of fear and hate” in England, and where data is available, in Wales and Scotland. It uncovers the often glaring extent of geographic splits between people of varying attitudes, with opposition to immigration and multiculturalism correlating closely with socio-economic deprivation.It found that of the 100 areas where people were most likely to oppose immigration, all were in towns or on the outskirts of cities, with 93 of them in the Midlands or north of England.Another key finding of the 60-page report, which links Hope Not Hate’s years of polling 43,000 people with data from other organisations, is that while overall attitudes to multiculturalism are softening, the opposite is happening with Islam.On attitudes specifically to Islam, however, the report found that while these softened between 2011 and 2016, this process then reversed, something it put down the series of terror attacks in the UK in 2017 and media coverage of sexual grooming gangs in places such as Rotherham.An attempt to locate centres of strongly anti-Muslim or far-right sentiment, done by mapping the locations of people who signed an online petition seeking the release from prison of the anti-Islam activist known as Tommy Robinson, found a strong link to the deprived towns associated with Brexit and more general opposition to immigration.Conversely, the study concluded, areas where people feel more in control of own lives and optimistic about their futures “become more resilient to hateful narratives and to political manifestations of this hatred”.It found that such isions closely correlate with people’s votes over Brexit, noting that opposition to the EU and prejudice towards Islam “are clearly interlinked issues for many”.But, it warned, departure from the EU alone is extremely unlikely to tackle the reasons why people in such poorer towns and city suburbs tend to be wary of change and hostile to immigration.In particular, it found, reducing immigration levels alone will not alleviate anxiety about new arrivals, not least since those most likely to express those views are based predominantly in areas where few immigrants actually live.The report concluded that people in deprived communities often saw immigration as part of “a broader story about dissatisfaction with their own lives”, repeating stories from the media about immigrants supposedly receiving preferential treatment from public services.“Immigration has become a totemic emblem for the many grievances people feel in modern Britain,” said Nick Lowles, the chief executive of Hope Not Hate, in an introduction to the report.“The strong view in many of these communities is that they have been abandoned and left to rot by the political establishment in preference to addressing the needs and wishes of new arrivals in the cities.”The only way to tackle such views would be to rebuild such neglected communities, Lowles said, “equipping their young people with the skills that will enable them to compete more effectively in the modern global world and, fundamentally, giving them a sense of hope in the future”.Another key ide, also strongly manifested in the Brexit vote, is age, with younger people found to be notably less likely to see immigration as a significant national problem or to worry about Islamist terrorism.While affluent people in cities tended to be more optimistic about the future than those in deprived towns, this process was reversed when it came to one thing: Brexit.Hope Not Hate identify two places as a study in contrasts: East Marsh in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and the Castle area of Cambridge. They are, the report says “each one of two Englands, emerging as the most hostile and most confidently multicultural places on our heatmap”.Grimsby as a whole is marked by deprivation and decline, caused by a diminished industrial base and fishing trade, as well as low skill levels.Interviews in the area for the report uncovered a sense of loss at the decline in fishing and the associated prosperity and worries about immigration.One interviewee complained the immigrants were “just coming in and taking our resources”. They added: “I’ve got to wait until I’m 67 instead of retiring at 60 now to get my pension.”In contrast, the study highlights Castle as emblematic of the urban-based, university-linked areas most commonly associated with the so-called “confident multiculturals”, those at ease with a changing UK.A central area of Cambridge, Castle covers St John’s College and the surrounding, prosperous residential area. Its levels of income, employment and adult skills are among the country’s highest.The report says: “Many of its residents are employees of Cambridge university and many more are students residing in and around the grounds of the impressive, elite colleges. The area is both pretty and prosperous, where few of its residents are dependent children or retirees. Economic concerns are uncommon in areas such as this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e503af5e2362639e12887374c7d49e0f9035bed/0_86_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8052fb919de428d41ee20da99da53b","title":"canelo alvarez boxing deal dazn richest sports contracts","story":"Canelo Álvarez has signed the largest contract in the history of sport, agreeing a five-year, 11-fight deal worth at least $365m with streaming service DAZN.The move comes after DAZN, which only launched in the US in September, looks to exploit a gap in the market after HBO announced it will end its 45-year history of broadcasting boxing at the end of 2018. Álvarez has a huge following in Mexico and the United States and his fights have pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars on pay-per-view. However, his fights on DAZN will not be part of a pay-per-view deal but will instead be accessible to viewers who pay $9.99 a month for a streaming service showing a package of combat sports. The Mexican fighter can also earn money on top of his deal if he helps bring in a certain number of subscriptions during his contract.Álvarez’s next fight is against Britain’s Rocky Fielding on 15 December at New York’s Madison Square Garden. “The most important thing to me was being able to give the fans the opportunity to see me fight without having to pay the $70 or $80 for my fights on pay-per-view,” the 28-year-old Álvarez told ESPN on Wednesday. “That was the most important thing, more important than what I am making.“It’s very important for me to give the fans the biggest fights and the most important fights, and I promise you I will always do that. The December fight with Fielding is a dangerous fight. I am moving up in weight, and I don’t know how my body will feel. But I always want to take on challenges, and I am very happy my fans will be able to see me fight for a small cost.”Álvarez earned around $50m from his last fight, a defeat of Gennady Golovkin in September.

She stepped into a leadership void and failed to fill it, making a disastrous appearance on Capitol Hill to answer questions about the Larry Nassar abuse scandal, ducking from reporters, and drawing criticism from athletes and clubs for inaction.The decision to hire Mary Lee Tracy, a coach who feuded with Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman and other athletes who decried abuse allegations and other problems in the sport, to a top federation position was the last straw. Perry resigned last month.Enter Mary Bono, best known for succeeding her late husband, the musician Sonny Bono, to Congress. After losing a reelection bid in 2012, she moved to Faegre Baker Daniels, a Washington consulting firm that drew fire for its work with USA Gymnastics from the legal team representing Raisman and many other athletes who have alleged sexual abuse at the hands of Nassar, a longtime US national team doctor now likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.Bono was named interim president of USA Gymnastics on Friday. She didn’t last long. Within a day, gymnastics fans had unearthed a tweet from Bono, in which she drew over a Nike swoosh on her shoes in reaction to the company’s ad campaign featuring outspoken former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. That tweet drew the ire of the most famous gymnast in the world, Simone Biles. “It’s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything,” wrote the Olympic champion, who is also sponsored by Nike, on Twitter. By Tuesday, Bono was gone, leaving with a petulant statement about the first amendment. While Bono does indeed have the right to say whatever she wants – even if it’s boneheaded – did USA Gymnastics or the US Olympic Committee do their research? Why wasn’t someone told to look through Bono’s Twitter history to see if there was anything that could cause friction with athletes? Was her history with a law firm that had drawn the anger of other gymnasts taken into account?If the saga was a simple matter of athletes complaining about trivial matters, perhaps the likes of Penny, Perry and Bono would merit some sympathy. But this isn’t about team selection or a choice of hotels during tournaments. This is about abuse. While Bono was in no way to blame for the Nassar scandal, her hasty appointment and exit is a sign of the dysfunction in an organization that looks after young athletes. This is about reassuring parents that USA Gymnastics is stable enough to ensure that their daughters (and, for that matter, sons) won’t end up in a courtroom reliving the horrors of their teen years.As well as the Bono disaster, USA Gymnastics has taken a few steps to bring in new leadership. At the insistence of the US Olympic Committee, which itself has dealt with internal soul-searching and external criticism as abuse scandals unfolded in several sports, most of the USAG board of directors resigned. (The board does not include the presidentCEO position, and a couple of athlete directors continued to serve on an interim board and now on the full board.)The interim board basically kept the wheels turning, approving World Championship selection procedures among other routine business, while going about the process of replacing itself. Eventually, more than half of the interim board became the full-fledged board. The new chair, Karen Golz, is one of the independent directors who joined the interim board. But by a random draw to stagger the terms of the new board members, her term is due to expire on 31 December.But that membership increase just shows how popular and essential this sport is to the United States – and why it needs strong leadership. Olympics of the past 34 years, dating back to the 1984 Los Angeles Games, have brought forth a steady stream of household names – Mary Lou Retton, Peter Vidmar, Bart Conner, Shannon Miller, Kerri Strug, Gabby Douglas … and Raisman and Biles, who have repeatedly raised their voices for change.Time will tell how many more changes will be needed before USA Gymnastics can truly move forward. But at the moment it appears there’s a long way to go."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/faf8c263ec4304239f2ed164de71459be63ffad0/232_113_2980_1789/master/2980.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a239077d91e2a8b8afc099b10148a03","title":"sri lanka v england third odi live cricket","story":"11th over (of 21): Sri Lanka 87-2 (Samarawickrama 31, Chandimal 13) The sage old advice says you should hit yourself back into form when you’re out of it: Chandimal, who’s looked increasingly irked at his struggles to get any sort of clean hit, decides to mishit-a-reverse-sweep-for-four-off-Rashid back into form. Then a rather more convincing shot from Samarawickrama, stepping down the track and launching one over wide mid-on that Stokes makes a noble effort to stop, but can’t quite. Good over for Sri Lanka though: 11 runs from it. 10th over (of 21): Sri Lanka 76-2 (Samarawickrama 26, Chandimal 7) Look who it is: Ben Stokes! He starts his spell with the loosener’s loosener, short and so wide it’s a wide. Next two balls are much tighter, bang on Samarawickrama’s off stump, then a slower ball baffles the batsmen and they collect two leg-byes, a flick off his thigh not collected by Buttler. Samarawickrama does well to dodge a cracking bumper, then there are two singles and that’s a very decent first over from Stokes. 9th over (of 21): Sri Lanka 71-2 (Samarawickrama 25, Chandimal 6) Rashid continues, and is greeted with a glorious shot by Samarawickrama, opening out his body and lofting a drive almost lazily over the covers, and to the boundary. Chandimal still struggling to get any purchase on any of his shots, and even looks a bit frustrated when he gets the strike. Six runs from the over. 8th over (of 21): Sri Lanka 65-2 (Samarawickrama 20, Chandimal 5) Full T20 captaincy from Morgan. After two overs from Curran, Olly Stone gets the ball back, and his second over goes much better than his first: there were 17 runs from that one, but this time just five, all from drives out to fielders in the deep. “Seen some strange things at cricket over the years,” writes Austin Baird, “but nothing to match Adil Rashid towelling off his arms whilst wearing full-length sleeves.”A reminder, for anyone just tuning in, that this is a 21 over per side match after rain wiped out the meat of the day. 7th over: Sri Lanka 60-2 (Samarawickrama 19, Chandimal 1) Smashing bowling from Rashid, mixing up his pace but not allowing new bat Chandimal to get anything away. One wicket, two runs from the over. Mo goes, and Dilly Rashid gets a bowl. And straight away he gets success, the ol’ googly finding a gap between Mendis’s bat and pad that you could drive a heavy roller through. It flicks off stump, and slightly weirdly the umpires check upstairs to see if it had actually bowled him. It had. A primary for Mendis. 6th over: Sri Lanka 58-1 (Samarawickrama 18, Mendis 0) Kusal Mendis is your new man. Curran keeps Samarawickrama quiet with a series of variations and slower balls and one that he was fortunate not to be called wide for. Just the three runs from the over. Fun fact from Ali Martin: “They filmed Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom not far from here ... cover your heart territory.”CurranT continues, and gets the breakthrough. Dickwella goes walkabout again, backing away and trying to launch one over mid-off, but gets nowhere near all of it and only manages to spoon it up in the air. Woakes, running backwards, just about pouches it. 5th over: Sri Lanka 55-0 (Dickwella 35, Samarawickrama 16) Here’s Mo, to bring some sanity to the game, to the sport, to life. He stems the bleeding in that he prevents any boundaries off the bat, but these two batsmen are extremely...busy, nurdling and hustling themselves to six runs from five balls, and then from the last another boundary, off Samarwickrama’s thigh pad and down to a very fine leg. 4th over: Sri Lanka 45-0 (Dickwella 33, Samarawickrama 12) Stone is hooked after just one over, replaced by Tom Curran. He gives Dickwella a slower ball, which the batsman waits for and goes for a lap sweep: he doesn’t get all of it, looping towards Rashid at short fine-leg but he drops a trickyish chance, ing forwards. CurranT looks unimpressed as the ball skips through Rashid’s grasp and to the boundary. Still, seven runs from the over is a good result for England, considering the alternatives. That’s the first powerplay done, anyway. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 38-0 (Dickwella 28, Samarawickrama 10) Despite the gallons of water that must have fallen on the ground, the outfield doesn’t seem particularly slow. As you will have worked out from six boundaries in the first two overs, obviously. Dickwella has ants in his pants: he’s fidgeting all over the crease, stepping away to leg twice for a couple of cuts. The first is nailed, but straight to point, but the second is more considered and is guided for four just past third man. Then another four, this time to the exact opposite point of the ground, clearing his leg and slapping one over wide mid-on. Then another, this one perhaps the best shot of the lot, through the covers. It’s been worth the wait, this. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 25-0 (Dickwella 16, Samarawickrama 9) Olly Stone gets the other new ball. Sadeera Samarawickrama gets two boundaries from the first two balls with either edge of his bat. The first extremely lucky, an inside edge attempting a cut that damn near wipes out his stumps, the second slightly less so but still not exactly where he intended, a big off drive flying high above the slips and to the third man ropes. A single, then Dickwella picks up his own pair of boundaries with a short-arm jab pull in front of mid-wicket, then a marvellously inventive flap over the keeper from a decent enough bouncer. Quite a start - 17 runs from the over. 1st over: Sri Lanka 8-0 (Dickwella 8, Samarawickrama 0) Woakes on the button straight away, cutting Dickwella in half with the first ball of the game. Impressive stuff, but the third ball is nothing of the sort: could have been an attempted slower ball, but it just turns into a floaty half-volley that Dickwella leathered to the cover fence. The opener then creates another boundary, taking a step or two to leg, opening himself up and driving through point. Brilliant shot, that. Anyway, less importantly we now have some cricket. Lovely Woakes will open the bowling, initially to Dickwella. Patience, rewarded. Chris Woakes was just interviewed on Sky (with Olly Stone), which leads to the inevitable question: is he the cricketer who your mum would be happiest if you brought them home for Sunday dinner? Clean cut, nice smile, polite, would almost certainly help with the dishes, would probably flirt with Ma just enough to make her laugh but not enough to create a weird vibe. Vikram Solanki, in his thoughtful, handsome way pointed out earlier that despite this basically being a T20 game, ODI rules still apply - which means new balls from each end. Spicy. Admin: 21 overs per side, initial powerplay is the first four overs. Four bowlers can bowl four overs, one can take five. Tom Curran replaces Liam Dawson for England, but Alex Hales won’t come in, as speculated. Eoin Morgan suggested they could mix up the order though: surely Jos Buttler will be bumped up a few spots. Dinesh Chandimal says Sri Lanka wanted to bat anyway......and will bowlIt is official now. Toss very shortly, game due to start in about half an hour. Assuming it doesn’t rain again...WELL WELL WELL. We could be on. Word from Ali Martin at the stadium, who reports that there will be a toss at 7.45pm local time, which is 3.15pm BST, with a view to a 21 over game starting at 8.153.45pm. This is from a local announcer, rather than anything official just yet...Umpire Dar has just spoken to Sky. His main concern is that, while the covers are in the process of being removed, it’s still drizzling out there. “It’s not good for cricket. The rain has to completely stop before we can start playing,” he says. “We have to think about the players’ safety.”Jason Roy is giving the groundstaff a hand removing the covers. In fact some of the England players are on the field (some scamp threw a football at the back of Joe Root’s head), at least two of whom - Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow - were engaged in some rather animated discussions with Aleem Dar in which they seemed to be complaining about said covers.Andy Tyacke has been boning up: “According to Triphobo, a trip planning company, October is the second highest month for rainfall in Sri Lanka. Just saying...”But not the highest, though. So you can see why they chanced it...Settle in and enjoy this lamentcelebration, from Abhijato Sensarma. Quite an email, this:“Cricket continues to be the only sport which goes on for five days yet yielding no substantial result, remaining a mostly elitist-dominated sport, and providing sub-par matches. The weather is infuriating - the amount of rain allowing the ongoing match to go on is not good enough to start a match in. As it happened in South Africa this year, a team can take only five minutes to finish the match off, but a half an hour break is taken because the rules cannot allow anything else. To prove my point, get this (even though you already did, I think) - Britain’s children know John Cena more than Cook, one of the greatest sportsmen of all time! “Yet we keep coming back, for Abbas’ magical deliveries, for the Steve Smith back and across actions, and for the ruthless domination of Virat Kohli. I come back for the Rohit Sharma pulls, his one-day double centuries, and the Rashid Khan magic. I sit through these pointless hours where I could have completed my homework to see one ball bowled, no matter how one-sided the entire match might be. I crave for cricket, through all of its peculiarities. “The good things about it come only once in a blue moon. Yet, I love cricket more than anything else. Maybe I should just listen to my friends and switch to watching football. Yet, I know I will remain here with all else, following cricket. Through the heartbreaks, and for the glories.”More covers are coming on. Most of the field is tarpaulin’d. The rain has got heavier, according to Nicholas Knight. “Do we get our money back if there’s no game?” asks Bob Warren. I for one will be applying to the ECB for the cost of the flapjack I bought earlier to help me through this. Ali Martin at the ground reports that more covers are coming on. From the point it stops they will probably need about an hour to dry everything out, and even that’s on the assumption there will be no further rain. Wouldn’t be a surprise if they pulled this soon. Still, could be worse. At least it’s only water on the field...All the covers were off, they’re now being replaced. A reminder that we have to start by 3.47pm BST to get a game. Cricket fans have to be natural optimists, so don’t let that waver...Looks like we’ll be lucky to get half a full ODI in here, so Ali has a suggestion...Mike Daniels has been on, and he’s defending the ECB. An unusual position, but probably quite correct. “I believe these games are being played in Sri Lanka, aren’t they?” writes Mike. “Therefore any issues with the scheduling is primarily down to the home Board, not the ECB.“What next, blame the ECB for Global Warming? I heard Mahela Jayawardene in the second game state that it was unusual for rain to be about in Dambulla at that time of year. I think I’ll take his word rather than anti-ECB keyboard warriors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13067aa35dd50bf522f047579f712c7b3e6d67d1/366_506_5061_3037/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ca60e890eec938754ea8071b3ac8d6","title":"send tip haunted places chance to win a 200  pund hotel voucher","story":"Go on, try to scare us with your most haunted or spooky places to visit across the UKThings that go bump in the night, ghostly footsteps or ghastly apparitions … With Halloween just round the corner, we’re steeling ourselves to hear about haunted day trip locations around the UK, be they pubs, ancient monuments or other “attractions”, particularly if they have a horrific history attached.Please be specific about locations, with websites and entrance costs where appropriate, and ensure your tip stays within around 100 words.Read the terms and conditions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e49f22d5f31b06d031997ccba88393c1f5fb055/0_579_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10b7213bb62534b5a1ff6894ec427694","title":"ann coulter believes the left has lost its mind should we listen","story":"The bestselling author has been criticized for dog-whistling to the far right. Now she’s taking aim at the left – can progressives learn anything from their sworn enemy? In person, Coulter, the bestselling author and personality who has recently taken to comparing the liberal media to cancer cells, is friendly and seemingly earnest. Her face is free of the smirk it often wears in photos, but she has the same long, lean features and razor-straight hair that have been plastered on the dustjackets of so many books, and the same unblinking intensity.Coulter’s authority as an unofficial mouthpiece for President Trump’s base is rivaled only by the revulsion she elicits from progressives. She is not the type of pundit who persuades by appealing to the middle ground. In 2004’s How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must), she offered 10 rules: “Outrage the enemy”, “Never apologize”, “Never compliment a Democrat”, “Never show graciousness toward a Democrat” – some of the rules overlap – “Never flatter a Democrat …”During her two-decade career, Coulter has followed these rules carefully. She has accused a group of 911 widows of reveling in their husbands’ deaths lamented that Timothy McVeigh didn’t park his truck in front of the New York Times building argued that the increasing popularity of soccer in America is a sign of moral decay and been fired from MSNBC for telling a disabled Vietnam veteran on air that people like him were to blame for losing the war. (She later said she didn’t know he was disabled.)In response, Coulter has been described, variously, as a human submachine pistol (Lloyd Grove, Washington Post, 2002) a “paid banshee” and “self-drawn cartoon” (David Carr, New York Times, 2003) “She-Devil” (John Edwards, 2007) “Trump’s Aryan Witch Enforcer” (conservative critic Charlie Sykes, 2016) and “troll” (multiple citations).Few consider Coulter a serious intellectual. But she’s a good debater – charismatic, dexterous, always ready with a talking point or quip. She also has an occasional, uncanny ability to sense political undercurrents that others miss.In June 2015, three days after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, Coulter appeared on an episode of the Bill Maher show. She told him that, of the 17 Republican primary candidates, Trump was the one with the best chance of winning the White House. The room erupted in laughter. She then proceeded to tell an incredulous Maher that Bernie Sanders was the only Democrat who could beat Trump.No one is laughing now. But that includes Coulter, because Trump’s first year and a half in the White House have been, well, something less than a resounding success – a fact Coulter attributes to Trump’s failure to fulfill campaign promises, like building a wall on the Mexican border, and, perhaps more importantly, failure to follow her advice.For someone who only two years ago wrote a book titled In Trump We Trust (subtitle: E Pluribus Awesome!), she has become one of his fiercest critics. Last year a meeting at the White House deteriorated into, the Daily Beast reported, “profanity-laced” shouting between Coulter and Trump. (He swore first, Coulter later said.)Trump memorably claimed he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue without losing votes for her part, Coulter, an evangelical Christian, has said she doesn’t care if Trump performs abortions in the White House as long as he follows through on restricting immigration.She still supports Trump, for lack of a satisfying alternative, but living the Trump presidency has been bitterly disappointing. “Every other day I want to strangle him,” she tells me.In her latest provocation, Resistance is Futile! How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind, Coulter argues that progressives, by responding hysterically to Trump, play into his hand. And “the contempt the Democrats have for ordinary people, for what they call ‘deplorables’?” she tells me. “You’ve got to flip that around.”Coulter arrives at a recent radio taping at Compound Media (“the free speech network”). She douses her hands with sanitizer, rubbing her long fingers together, and explains that she has a cold and can’t shake hands or embrace. She offers fist-bumps instead.Coulter is a late riser who usually sleeps till noon, though she makes an exception for media opportunities.She takes her responsibilities as a self-publicist seriously, and works at a relentless pace. While promoting her third book, 2003’s Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism, she gave 160 interviews in less than a month, according to the New York Times’ late David Carr.Coulter and the other guests assemble in the studio. Coulter chews on nicotine gum. Host Bill Schulz opens by plugging her book.Coulter says, “I’ve been a little upset with the president for keeping – let’s see – none of his promises,” adding that her book is “excellent advice for the ‘Resistance’”, though “unfortunately they all hate me with the hot, hot hate of a thousand suns, so they won’t read it.”Trump “doesn’t have a history in politics”, she says later in the conversation, and “he hasn’t thought deeply about a lot of these issues –”“WHAT,” Schulz shouts in mock outrage.The other panelists agree with Coulter’s lackluster assessment of the Trump presidency but there seems to be a consensus that the left’s response is histrionic and will backfire.“These attacks, this stuff from the left – this is what’s going to get him re-elected,” another guest, the comedian Dave Landau, says.Coulter’s sometimes-affinity with Trump is unsurprising in addition to a shared enthusiasm for hand sanitizer, both owe their success to a willingness to say out loud the things other people think in their heads. Those who read Coulter’s books – all have been bestsellers – and devotedly follow her media appearances love her because she articulates suspicions many Americans hold: that the media has a leftwing bias that progressives shut down disagreement by crying racism or sexism that neither party cares about the working class.Her audience is “a narrow band of people”, Carr once observed, “who nonetheless number in the millions”.“Immigrants are great if you’re rich,” Coulter tells me. “You live in New York or LA, you get your pool cleaned. Rosa the maid cleans everything, serves, picks up the kids, makes the beds. Life is grand. But I go out to America. And I knew that immigration was an enormous effing issue that our political class – Republicans for the donor money, Democrats for the votes – was ignoring.”In June 2015 Coulter published Adios America! The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole. The book argued that unchecked immigration, both legal and illegal, was increasing crime, straining the welfare state, and depressing blue-collar wages, and that the media, because of political correctness, and big business, for cheap labor, were preventing honest debate.The book’s most serious charge has since become a mainstream allegation by conservatives: if Democrats have their way, Coulter claimed, they will add up to 30 million new voters to the rolls – overwhelmingly dependent on big government and loyal to the Democratic party. In other words, liberal elites support mass immigration because they are thumbing the scale of democracy itself.Then an interview she did about the book went viral. “I’m in a cab on the way to the airport and I get a text from Trump’s people: ‘Mr Trump would like a copy of your book overnighted to him.’ So I did. And two weeks later he’s talking about Mexican rapists. He has uncanny political instincts.”In the Atlantic, in December 2015, the former Bush speechwriter David Frum described Coulter’s book as the “political book of the year”. “Perhaps no single writer has had such immediate impact on a presidential election since Harriet Beecher Stowe,” he added, in a sentence that might cause consternation to the author of the antislavery novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Frum argued that rosy liberal claims about immigration are not borne out in statistics. Although some immigrants have assimilated well – he cited Nigerian Americans – other immigrant communities suffer from high unemployment, welfare dependency, and educational failure, he said.In an incisive recent piece in Current Affairs, a left-leaning journal, writer Brianna Rennix acknowledged that Coulter was probably correct about Democrats (and Republicans) exploiting immigration for cheap labor and votes. But Adios America! is a “vicious, dehumanizing” book, the review said, and one with eugenic undertones.Rennix added that the book, which cites stomach-churning examples of crimes against women in immigrant communities, seemed more bothered by the fact that these crimes occurred in America than the fact that they occurred.Trump, however, loved Coulter’s book. And Coulter loved Trump. He was, she believed, a kind of idiot savant. When recalling the moment on 16 June 2015 that Trump came down the golden escalator to announce his candidacy, she sounds like a Christian describing when she was born again. She threw all her energy into getting him elected.Two years later, the gold varnish has worn off.But she still loves Trump for his ability to antagonize progressives and the media – whose tendency to overreact, she argues, is what always saves him. This is terrain that Coulter, more than almost anyone, understands.Or as she once put it: “When the spittle starts coming from liberals’ mouths, you know you have struck gold.”Two days after her taping with Bill Schulz, Coulter has another radio show, with Mark Simone of New York’s WOR 710. After a show Coulter often goes to lunch with the panelists, but she is still sick, and possibly still contagious. A social function would invite handshakes, which would be socially irresponsible – and perhaps risk foreign agents infiltrating her immune system and making her sick all over again. One can’t be too careful.Hygiene and physical perfection are preoccupations of Coulter’s. She is fond of the word “retarded” as a term of disparagement (though she has said she would never use the term to refer to “someone with an actual mental handicap”), and in Adios America! writes contemptuously of disabled immigrants. She told me she believes pretty girls are more likely to be conservatives.Coulter does agree to join me at a cafe in SoHo. Since a 2004 pie-throwing incident at the University of Arizona (“They missed, because liberals throw like girls”), Coulter has taken greater security precautions, sometimes including a bodyguard. She navigates New York with a highly developed sense of which areas are “safe” for her – none, really, outside the Upper East Side.At the cafe she glances at the menu but orders only a chai latte to accompany her nicotine gum. “I have a few coastal elite habits,” she says when I raise an eyebrow at the latte.Last December, after Marco Rubio announced that he would not support the Republican tax bill unless it included more provisions for low-income families, Coulter tweeted, “We singles live empty lives of quiet desperation and will die alone. Now Rubio is demanding that we also fund happy families with children who fill their days with joy.”But besides noting, in passing, that she has dated men who drive motorcycles, Coulter declines to say much about her romantic life. She has never been married, though she has been engaged, she says vaguely, “two or three times”. Previous boyfriends include Dinesh D’Souza, the rightwing pundit Trump pardoned for making illegal campaign contributions. D’Souza recently unveiled a new film, Death of a Nation, exploring parallels between Trump and Abraham Lincoln.The only other question Coulter refuses to answer is her age. According to the New York Times and Wikipedia, she is 56. (Coulter tells me information online is incorrect and she has been trying to get a hold of Jimmy Wales, the founder of Wikipedia, to fix it.)Coulter has an active social life and many friends, including in liberal bastions like Hollywood. Some of these friends, such as a successful screenwriter and producer who asked to be anonymous, keep their relationship with Coulter discreet to avoid falling victim to what the screenwriter called “reverse McCarthyism”.Although she claims to despise the coastal elite, Coulter’s upbringing, in New Canaan, Connecticut, epitomized establishment values. Her father, John Coulter, was an FBI agent who hunted Soviet spies after retiring from the Bureau he became a union-busting lawyer. He met Coulter’s mother, Nell, while working an FBI assignment at a uranium plant in Kentucky. The Coulters were conservative, religiously observant (mother Presbyterian, father Catholic) Americans of Scottish descent, frugal and not given to displays of emotion. John Coulter was “of the old school, a man of few words, the un-Oprah, no crying or wearing your heart on your sleeve, and reacting to moments of great sentiment with a joke”, she wrote in a 2008 eulogy for her father.Discussion during family dinners focused on politics, which Coulter has credited with refining her debating skills.“Father didn’t care what popular opinion was,” she writes. “There was right and wrong.” He was contemptuous of moral relativism on issues like abortion, and she recalls “the look of disgust” on his face when he saw a picture in the newspaper of Senator Ted Kennedy, a Catholic Democrat, praying a rosary.Coulter brought her father’s uncompromising politics to Cornell, where she co-founded the conservative Cornell Review. After law school at the University of Michigan she spent several years doing dreary legal work in New York. In 1995 she moved to Washington DC to work for the Senate judiciary committee.Coulter’s first book, High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton, was a methodical argument for impeachment. In contrast to her later books, the tone and style were lawyerly and self-consciously serious.The book was notable in another respect. At the time, many liberals, including prominent feminists, excused Clinton’s affair with Lewinsky as consensual, or painted Lewinsky, a 22-year-old White House intern, as a power-hungry harlot. Coulter argued that the power difference between Clinton and Lewinsky made the relationship inherently inappropriate and exploitative.(Perhaps to avoid being mistaken for a hero of intersectional feminism, Coulter has since expressed interest in revoking women’s suffrage.)Detractors on both left and right have accused Coulter of using coded language to appeal to the alt-right.In September 2015, during a televised Republican debate in which the candidates kept reverting to platitudes about supporting Israel, Coulter tweeted, with characteristic tact: “How many f---ing Jews do these people think there are in the United States?”The conservative writer David French argued in National Review that Coulter was dog-whistling to a “very small, very angry crowd that’s far more white nationalist than it is recognizably conservative”. (“Dog-whistling,” Coulter says when I describe French’s accusation. “How original!” She calls French’s writing “stupid” and “boring”.)“In 20 years,” Coulter declared on Twitter last year, “Russia will be the only country that is recognizably European.”“She means white,” a commenter explained, for anyone wondering.VDARE, an anti-immigration website that publishes explicit white supremacists, carries Coulter’s column. The website is named for Virginia Dare, believed to be the first English child born in North America Dare died at the mysterious, doomed Roanoke colony, a fate the group’s founders believe could be prophetic for white North Americans.Coulter is a longtime friend of the site’s founder, Peter Brimelow, and credits him in the acknowledgements of Adios America! (She also credits Peter Thiel.) Brimelow denies his site is racist. It publishes people such as Jared Taylor, founder of the white nationalist magazine American Renaissance, and John Derbyshire, who was fired from National Review for his writing on race.Charlie Sykes, a writer for the Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, told me Coulter was once an asset to the conservative movement, but morphed from “intellectually substantive to demagogically sensationalistic, much like the movement itself”. He added: “Her willingness to traffic in racial and ethnic bigotry has done incalculable damage, because she’s normalized it for a huge swath of conservatives.”There is nothing inherently racist about restricting immigration, Coulter says. She calls the left’s attitudes about immigration hypocritical.She argues that the mainstream media ignores serious problems associated with immigration, especially violence and drug crime.Low-skilled immigration “drives down wages for low-wage workers”, Coulter tells me. “Of course it does. What is your counterargument? You’ve repealed the laws of supply and demand?”The journalist Sam Quinones, author of Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic, acknowledged this in an op-ed last year. “I recognize the anger of citizens at the bottom of the economy who must compete with those in the US without permission,” he writes. “I don’t like to hear them characterized as racist simply for pointing it out.”But, he adds, Americans enjoy cheap goods and services because of immigrant labor. Trump voters want “to eat their cake and keep it, too”.Sykes argues that Coulter’s anti-immigration, anti-trade, anti-globalization stance “isn’t conservative in any meaningful sense of the word” and “has more in common with European-style popular-front nationalism than conservatism”.“I think what Coulter represents has always been a recessive gene on the right,” he tells me. “But, until recently, it’s been a minority point of view that was held in check.”The auditorium of the politan Republican Club on the Upper East Side is packed to capacity. Late arrivals stand in the back. Everyone chatters excitedly as they wait. The crowd varies in age but skews overwhelmingly white. An earnest man with an eastern European accent strains to see the podium. “I was much closer to Trump and Melania,” he says wistfully, and shows me photographs he took when he saw them in Washington. He glows as if they are photos of his children.Undocumented immigrants are the single greatest threat facing America, he feels. At least “every second one” are violent criminals, and even the ones who aren’t are still here illegally. If it were up to him, he says, they would be eligible for only three “benefits” – immediate deportation, jail with hard labor, or the electric chair.His ideal policy would also pare down legal immigration, almost to zero, “like Japan”, and admit only the most highly skilled applicants, strictly on merit. (This aspiration is somewhat puzzling Japan is in economic and cultural crisis because of its rapidly shrinking population, and without an influx of new blood it may lose a third of its population this century.)Aren’t you an immigrant? I ask.Yes, he says, from Latvia. He was granted asylum during the cold war. In any event, he hastens to add, he has more than earned his keep.Coulter comes into the room to a standing ovation. “The main thesis of my book,” she says, “is that the media are liars – every one of them.”This turns out to be a popular message. The audience loves her. She has no prepared remarks, instead moving from topic to topic using her best lines, often verbatim from the book.On Trump’s alleged obstruction of justice: all Trump has done is lie to the media, which is legal, and “there is nothing wrong with lying to the media. In fact I recommend it.”One audience member asks Coulter to speak to the significance of the massive online media sphere that has flourished as an alternative to the liberal mainstream media.“For democracy to live we must kill the media,” Coulter says. “There may be a rash of reporter suicides – have no sympathy.” We must destroy the media, and rebuild it on “more ethical lines”.The time has come for her greatest line of all: Trump, she says, is chemotherapy for the country. The process won’t be pleasant. “We’ll get sick, we’ll throw up, it really sucks. But the entire New York Times editorial board dies.”The audience explodes, clapping wildly, shrieking in laughter, heads thrown back like hyenas at the site of a kill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90f8ee2e0782362db7173556c79f00b1fba7328e/0_46_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2283c36c4686f555c6daad8b9248616","title":"florida hurricane michael looters target homes without power","story":"Authorities are arresting around 10 suspected looters every night in the Florida Panhandle since Michael crashed ashore a week agoLaw enforcement authorities are arresting around 10 suspected looters every night in an area of the Florida Panhandle left in the dark since Hurricane Michael crashed ashore a week ago.Bay county sheriff’s office has warned that looters are targeting homes and businesses in the devastated region – and they’re almost always armed, the Panama City News Herald reported.One victim was Victoria Smith, who said thieves entered her home while she and her four children were sleeping. She had left the front door open to allow a breeze in during the steamy weather following the hurricane, as her power was off.The perpetrator snatched her purse even as she was clutching it to her chest while she slept. She said she was so exhausted from trying to survive and fend for her children after the storm that she didn’t even hear them enter.In some areas of the county, spray-painted signs warn “Looters will be shot” and “You steal, we kill”.Stanford says it’s been a stressful time for officers, many of whom lost their homes but are working 16 hour shifts. He says the current influx of resources and officers from other areas will help quell the lawlessness and deter attempted looting.“Most our officers lost their homes, have been working 16- to 18-hour shifts with no sleep, no shower and now they’re encountering armed iniduals,” Stanford told the local newspaper. “It’s a stressful time for everyone in Bay County.”The scope of the Hurricane Michael’s fury is still being discovered after nearly a week of missing-persons reports and desperate searches of largely-flattened small towns such as Mexico Beach. Neighborhoods devastated by the most powerful hurricane to hit the continental US in nearly 50 years, and the most ferocious in recorded history to hit the Panhandle. Cellphone service has started to return to the stricken zone but there are 137,000 customers in northern Florida still without power.Lack of electricity and phone service is hampering efforts to distribute food and water and to contact residents not heard from since the storm hit.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

The incoming provincial government, led by the nationalist Coalition Avenir Québec party, has announced plans to outlaw the wearing of religious symbols by any public employees – including teachers.The new government, which will officially be sworn in 18 October after a historic election victory this month, argues that “secularism law” is necessary to preserve Quebec’s culture and historic church-state ide.The proposed law will have a transition period, during which the affected can move to “non-authority” positions. After this, those who keep wearing religious articles “will have made the choice to no longer have a job if they wish to continue wearing a religious symbol”, said CAQ elected representative Geneviève Guilbault.A CAQ representative refused several interview requests, saying its government was “still in transition”.For Kassef, who moved to Quebec from Kuwait when she was two, removing her hijab is out of the question.“It’s part of who I am,” said Kassef. “If they tell me to remove it, I guess they’ll have to manage that many more little crazy people in the classroom on their own. The school system is already stressed. Do you think this will help kids have a quality education?”He also proposed kicking out those remaining who fail French and values tests after three years of residency in the province.Yet Legault is hardly the first politician to crack down on religious minorities in Quebec, where the debate over immigration and identity has simmered for well over a decade.It is further complicated by French, the province’s dominant language, the survival of which remains an enduring preoccupation. Successive nationalist politicians have alleged that immigration will undermine the language and Québécois culture.But a 2016 report from the province’s French language authority noted use of French in the workplace among non-native speakers has actually increased over the last 20 years.But over the past decade Quebec has struggled to reconcile its historical identity with the realities of a multicultural Canada.A government commission in 2008 recommended that judges, police, prison guards and anyone else with coercive powers shouldn’t wear religious symbols “for the appearance of impartiality”.Five years later, the separatist Parti Québécois attempted – and ultimately failed – to pass the so-called “Quebec values charter”, which would have banned all public servants from wearing “conspicuous” religious symbols.Philosopher Charles Taylor, who cochaired the 2008 government commission, said the protracted debate over religious minorities has led to a “tearing” of Quebec society.Taylor changed his stance on the wearing of religious garb following the 2017 shooting at a Quebec City mosque, in which a gunman killed six and injured 19 worshippers in a targeted attack on Muslims.“It’s not a simple cause and effect, but these debates create a climate in which unhinged people will take up this issue,” Taylor says. “It’s not always shootings or violence of course – but it creates a terrible climate for these people.”Kassef fears this climate will return to Quebec when the CAQ introduces its secularism law, which the CAQ has signaled as a priority. “Anytime this talk starts up, people who are on the racist side start coming out of the woodwork. It’s as if we’re normalizing these intolerant tendencies,” she said.There are apparent limits to the CAQ’s secularism.The party announced that it had no plans to remove a gold crucifix from Quebec’s National Assembly, placed there in 1936 to symbolize the connection between the state and the then-dominant Catholic church."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d17cb16d4e5bccacbf75678b556e04bd3be2420/0_0_4800_2881/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cda85356dc6737d5c9e9a61a15674b16","title":"france says britons could need visa to visit after no deal brexit","story":"Government publishes draft bill outlining areas of concern relating to hard BrexitThe French government has said a no-deal Brexit would leave Britons needing visas to visit France and put UK nationals already living there in an “irregular” legal situation.It has published a draft bill aimed at addressing the consequences of the UK crashing out of the EU without any agreement. British citizens living in France would immediately become “third-country nationals”, preventing them from holding certain jobs and limiting access to healthcare and welfare, and passenger travel and freight movements across the Channel would be delayed.The bill outlines seven areas of concern covering Britons’ right to visit, live and work in France. It gives the French government power to introduce new legal measures where necessary by emergency decree, as opposed to parliamentary vote, within 12 months of the law being passed.It does not detail exactly how France intends to address the consequences of a hard Brexit, but says any measures are likely to depend on reciprocal agreements with the UK government.“The government is very aware of the situation and rights of French citizens settled in the UK,” the draft bill states. “The government will take appropriate measures regarding the situation of UK citizens in France. It will take account of the status the UK gives our citizens on its territory.”Britain is scheduled to leave the EU at 11pm UK time on 29 March 2019. Any failure to reach an exit deal would leave Britons living in the remaining 27 EU nations and around 3 million EU citizens living in the UK facing an uncertain future.“In the event of a withdrawal without agreement, British citizens and their family members who until now had the right to free movement and free settlement in the whole European Union become third-country citizens and will as a consequence be subject, in principle, to common law. That is to say, obliged to present a visa to enter French territory and to hold a residence permit to remain there,” the proposed bill says.It points out that certain professions, including doctor, pharmacist, tobacconist and jobs in public services, are mostly restricted to French and EUEEC nationals.French Channel ports as well as passenger and freight transporters are already planning for a no-deal Brexit, which the bill says would result in “the reinstating of formalitiescontrols on goods and passengers to and from the UK”.Last week Thierry Grumiaux, of the National Federation of Road Transporters, said a delay of two minutes per vehicle for extra customs checks would led to 16-mile (27km) tailbacks on roads around major French ports.

Instead he claimed the allegations were a political conspiracy and launched criminal proceedings against Ramani.His response failed to stem the accusations, with 17 women signing a statement on Tuesday accusing him of sexually harassing them.Ramani said on Twitter:Akbar’s resignation is a significant development in the country’s burgeoning #MeToo story, but it is unclear whether it will have ramifications for other politicians accused of sexual misconduct.There are 48 members of parliament across India with cases registered against them relating to crimes against women, a quarter of them members of the BJP, according to statistics from the Association for Democratic Reforms thinktank."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47725707a3f754f629c8648e2538fab137d4b7a/0_0_4066_2439/master/4066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=903bca8debff0d422a7f93d263c89a48","title":"kerala hindu temple opens women sabarimala india","story":"A standoff is under way in the south Indian state of Kerala, where mainly female protesters are attempting to stop other women from entering the Sabarimala temple.On Wednesday, the Hindu shrine will open its gates for the first time since 28 September, after the supreme court struck down an entry ban on women of menstruating age. The judges ruled the ban against girls and women aged between 10 and 50 as discriminatory and, therefore, unconstitutional.The decision triggered a public outcry in Kerala, with some female devotees saying it was more important to uphold religious tradition than be swayed by notions of gender equality.Thousands of protesters gathered on the roads leading to the hilltop temple and heckled any woman they suspected was going there. On Tuesday, the protesters intercepted all oncoming vehicles to prevent female passengers from visiting the shrine, one of Hinduism’s holiest. Female journalists have also been attacked.One devotee who was walking to the temple with her son and daughter was forced to turn back by hecklers, despite a heavy police presence.The protesters have threatened to lie across roads to prevent motorists from reaching the temple. They have also said they were considering mass suicide one woman who tried to kill herself was stopped by police.The temple is dedicated to Lord Ayyappa, who is believed to have been celibate. Menstruating women who enter the shrine are considered by traditionalists to be disrespecting the deity.Kalyani Jacob, a student and devotee of Lord Ayappa in New Delhi, said: “We don’t mind not being allowed in. We don’t mind waiting until we turn 50. The ban is not anti-women. This is just a very old custom the supreme court should not have interfered with.”The Kerala government has said it will uphold the supreme court ruling. Those against it include a large number of female devotees, the former royal family who are custodians of the temple, the Congress party and the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).The female-led demonstrations have surprised many liberals in Kerala, a progressive state that has led calls for reforms to the Hindu caste system and challenged sexism.Kerala’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said: “At one point, women had no right to cover their breasts in Kerala and the lower castes were made to stand far away from Brahmins.

By comparison, the global average exposure of humans to ionizing radiation is between 2.4 and 3 millisieverts a year.Karin Taira, a Real Fukushima guide who runs the Lantern House, a guesthouse in the Odaka district, claims the Netflix documentary overstated the risk posed by radiation and painted an unrelentingly negative picture of the area. “It gave the impression that this place is hopeless,” she says. “But there is hope here.”But there are also reminders of the devastation unleashed by the tsunami and the nuclear meltdown.On a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, a memorial lists the names of 182 people who were swept away to their deaths in the town of Namie. Inland, just beyond the tsunami’s destructive reach, is evidence of a different kind of tragedy. At Kumamachi primary school, just two kilometres from the wrecked nuclear plant, classrooms appear frozen in time, with books, bags and other possessions abandoned when the order to evacuate was given. Outside, wild grass and weeds are reclaiming streets where wild boar and raccoons roam, untroubled by humans.Only a small number of the 150,000 people evacuated after the triple meltdown have returned to areas deemed safe by the government. Some parents are concerned about their children’s long-term exposure to radiation, amid evidence that in some areas levels are higher than the government claims. Others have built new lives elsewhere and see no compelling reason to return to areas whose economies were ruined by the disaster.But a semblance of civic life is returning to some towns and villages, which before the tsunami were known for their farm produce and seafood. This summer, a beach 40km north of Fukushima Daichi reopened after seven years. Farmers are replanting rice and other crops, and fishermen have returned to the sea. Solar plants have been built in abandoned fields, although they are dwarfed by the estimated 16m bags containing radioactive topsoil removed from the region during a huge decontamination effort.Fukushima City will host baseball and football matches during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and J Village, commandeered in the aftermath of the meltdown to host thousands of workers and their equipment, has been restored to its original role as a football coaching centre.In the town of Okuma, local official Shuyo Shiga and his colleagues are preparing for the opening next April of a new town office, apartments and shops following the partial lifting of the evacuation order. There are also loose plans to refurbish traditional Japanese houses and advertise them though Airbnb.“Visitors who come for the first time are amazed that there are people actually living here,” Shiga says.Takahiro Kanno has seen his hotel, located by the coast in the city of Minamisoma, transform from lodgings for power plant and decontamination workers into a destination for tourists and parties of schoolchildren.“It’s still difficult to encourage people to come, but those who do are amazed to see that people living so close to the nuclear power plant are leading normal lives again.”Nora Redmond, an Australian who was touring the area with her husband Billy and their daughter Ciara, said they had “done their homework” on the risks posed by radiation and had no concerns for their health during the several hours they spent in areas close to Fukushima Daiichi.“We heard that the region was suffering from depopulation so we thought it would be a good idea to spend some time and money up here,” Redmond says.“I didn’t realise the scale of the devastation, that people’s whole history has gone. We must have seen 20 houses being pulled down as we were driving around. You could see the beautiful wooden interiors … and they were being reduced to rubble. That was what struck me most.”Fukushima residents balk at the suggestion that they are victims – a label that ignores the pockets of economic activity sprouting up in communities where radiation levels have been brought down to government-set targets. In Europe, average natural background exposure ranges from below 2 millisieverts a year in Britain to more than 7 millisieverts in Finland, according to the pro-nuclear lobby group the World Nuclear Association.“It will take years for this and other neighbourhoods to look like they did before the disaster,” Kanno concedes. “In the meantime, we want tourists to come and see for themselves and to learn what life is really like here. But this is just a start.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days offer prospective students a unique opportunity to sample life on campusWhat you need to know to make sure you take full advantage of your open day opportunityOpen days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will be"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3666694.1539787400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"primary school campaigns to prevent deportation of nine year old pupil","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA screenshot of St Cronan’s School’s campaign to prevent the deportation of a nine year old student,  Eric Zhi Ying Xue.A primary school has appealed to the Minister for Justice to prevent the deportation of a nine-year-old student.Eric Zhi Ying Xue, a fourth class pupil at St. Cronan’s in Bray, Co Wicklow, was born in Ireland but does not have Irish citizenship.His mother, however, is Chinese and has had her application for leave to remain rejected.St Cronan’s set up a public petition on Tuesday requesting that Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan revoke the deportation order. By Wednesday afternoon it had attracted more than 20,000 signatures.The petition states: “Eric was born in Ireland but is not an Irish citizen and has never been out of the country.“If he is forced to go to China, where his mother was born, he will have no access to China’s health or education systems because he is not a Chinese citizen. This is a humanitarian issue - Eric urgently needs your support.”The Wicklow school’s campaign follows a successful campaign by a school last week to prevent the deportation of a 14 year old boy to Nigeria.Offaly teenager Nonso Muojeke, who lived in Ireland since he was two years old, was due to be deported after his family had failed to secure leave to remain in the State.The Department of Justice confirmed last week that the deportation order against the boy and his family had been revoked.Muojeke, a student of Tullamore College, was at the centre of a community-led campaign to halt his deportation and that of his older brother Viktor and his mother Chidiebere Muojeke.An Uplift petition to halt the deportation was signed by more than 21,000 people.Following the decision,Nonso Muojeke expressed his thanks to the Minister for Justice for the “humane way” he handled the case.“ I am very grateful to my friends, my school, the Tullamore community and everyone else who has supported me. I am really looking forward to my future here in Ireland,” he said.A statement from the Department of Justice said the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) had revoked the deportation order following “a detailed reconsideration of the family’s immigration case in light of court proceedings and the receipt of updated submissions from the family in September.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Laura Kenna charged with attempted murder of Fionnuala Bourke in DrumcondraTim Marks (55) worked with security firm ICTS Ireland for nine years before dismissalTeenager claims she suffers from Erb\u0026rsquos Palsy sustained during delivery at Louth hospitalEric Zhi Ying Xue, a fourth class pupil at St Cronan\u0026rsquos in Bray, has never lived abroadFormer taoiseach was with Mr Duffy when he diedGsoc investigation to examine nature of interaction between garda\u0026iacute and Garda killerMichael Connolly of Rossport, Ballina, was arrested earlier this month in Co KildarePeople are no longer bothering to report incidents, says Irish Farmers\u0026rsquo AssociationApplicant told Circuit Civil Court she had been promised place in a universityGovernment will not contest liability for non-disclosure of audits, Minister insistsJury at inquest into death of P\u0026aacutedraic Carney recommends use of helmets by all cyclistsMan in his 30s was treated at the scene by paramedics but died from his injuriesCouncil granted order to have 25 people moved due from site to alleged fire hazardFilippo Lombardi (21) denies inflicting grievous bodily harm on Irish Liverpool fanDublin park is one of only two parks in the world to receive a gold awardCharlie Flanagan: \u0026lsquoHe has done enormous service to the State\u0026rsquoRow centres over representation rights and deduction of union subscriptions from pay"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But such is the magnitude of his lead, and the lack of penetration by any of his rivals, that only Higgins could beat himself now. And while that may be possible, it is extremely unlikely, to put it mildly.Whatever its other merits, Higgins’s strategy of campaigning on his own terms has so far a canny political judgment. He has shipped criticism from many political commentators, desperate for a competition, and has been accused of treating his opponents, and the process, with contempt.They are understandable charges, and Higgins’s answer – that he is unselfishly protecting the office of the presidency to his own cost as a candidate – takes some neck. He has brushed aside questions about spending in the Áras, promising more information once the election is over. He has glided through respectful interrogations ever watchful for lese-majeste.There’s no sign that the public cares one whit. Who knows: they may be grateful to Higgins for the lack of fuss.They are certainly unenthused, to put it mildly, by Higgins’s slate of challengers. Higgins dominates not only because he is so popular, but because the non-Higgins vote is dispersed between five candidates – none of whom have managed to get a head of steam.Seán Gallagher at 12 per cent and Liadh Ní Riada at 11 per cent are the only ones who have registered with the public at all. Gallagher’s campaign is a pale shadow of his 2011 performance which had him on course to take the presidency until his spectacular flameout in the final days. Why is this? Likely because Gallagher’s pitch hasn’t changed, and the country has.Ní Riada’s anaemic numbers might give her party pause for thought. Yesterday’s poll showed that the Sinn Féin brand has never been stronger. But Ní Riada’s United Ireland message has flopped. That must be unsettling for Sinn Féin.The remaining candidates – Gavin Duffy, Peter Casey and Joan Freeman – seem set for little return for a lot of money and effort. Duffy’s campaign especially has mystified observers who have watched and heard a reputed communications expert make such a mess of his communications.Presidential campaigns have tended to get sharper and dirtier as polling day approaches. Perhaps his opponents will throw everything they have at Michael D perhaps they will decide turning negative isn’t worth it at this stage.

Photograph: INPHOBryan KeaneIf it was a junior B football match - with one team scoring goals and points for fun while the other chased shadows with declining levels of enthusiasm - the losing manager would have gestured to the referee to blow it all up. This morning’s Ipsos MRBI opinion poll confirms Michael D Higgins’s - barring catastrophe - unassailable lead, with the President on a whopping 66 per cent of first-preference votes. Seán Gallagher is second, just a shade behind on, er, 12 per cent, with Sinn Féin’s Liadh Ní Ríada on 11 per cent, Joan Freeman on 5 per cent, Gavin Duffy on 4 per cent and Peter Casey on 2 per cent. A continued focus on spending in Áras an Uachtaráin has evidently had little effect on Higgins’s electoral halo, and recent criticisms of him for skipping some broadcast debates are also likely to abate. The ridiculous - and rightly criticised - scenario of Higgins sitting out a broadcast debate on Monday while his campaign team rang in with clarifications will be replaced by the President taking part in the first six-way television debate between all candidates on Virgin Media One tonight, with another on RTÉ next week.Anyone counting on a Higgins flameout may be distracted by the smoke coming from the direction of the Peter Casey campaign instead.Casey has given an interview to the Irish Independent, in which he questions if Travellers should be recognised as an ethnic minority because they are “basically people camping in someone else’s land”.“They are not paying their fair share of taxes in society,” Casey, who seems intent on causing a scrap even if the game is over, told the Indo. The October summit of the European Council - initially slated as the one that would see agreement on the backstop - begins this evening after the weekend difficulties in the Brexit negotiations.At a meeting of ministers last night, Michel Barnier confirmed he was open to a one-year extension to the transition period - which would see the UK stay in the customs union and single market even longer after Brexit formally takes place next March - to help resolve the Irish Border question, as had been reported over the past week. The difficulty inherent in such an idea for Theresa May was best illustrated by the headline in Saturday’s ‘Daily ’, which splashed with the story at the weekend under the headline “An extra year shackled to Brussels” . ’s weekend interpretation of the idea was as an effort to bring the DUP onside.EU leaders will wait to see if May moves from existing UK positions over the coming days to warrant the convening of the November summit. The key sticking point is London’s demand for the backstop to be time limited. Sources say the UK has not, in recent sessions, proposed an actual end date but is pushing for the principle of a time limit, which has been rejected by the EU. In the past, the UK had proposed the backstop only apply until the end of the initial transition period, which applies after Brexit takes effect next March.It is envisaged the Northern Ireland backstop would be legally binding in the withdrawal treaty, but that another backstop - keeping the entire UK in a customs union - would not be as detailed. The detail of such an arrangement would be clarified during negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship.However, a declaration of the principle of an all-UK backstop could be included as a protocol to the withdrawal treaty, but the UK feels this would be difficult to sell politically. The EU is said to be worried that going into too much details now could pre-empt negotiations on the future relationship. There are also concerns on state aid rules, among other issues. Yet, some Government sources believe a deal is there to be done - if May can face down the hardliners and DUP, on whom her government relies for support.

Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            British prime minister Theresa May has so far shown little sign of moving away from her Chequers plan. Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesEU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is open to extending Britain’s Brexit transition period by another year, according to reports. Mr Barnier has said he is open to the possibility of a one-year extension to Britain’s Brexit transition in return for British prime minister heresa May accepting a “two-tier” backstop to avoid a border in Northern Ireland, according to EU diplomats.On the eve of a Brexit summit in Brussels on Wednesday night, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator told ministers from the 27 member states that Brussels was ready to propose fresh ideas to reach a deal by next month, the Financial Times said.The plan, informally suggested to the UK in talks last week, involves including a one-year extension clause for the 21-month transition period, which ends in December 2020. This would grant more time to agree a new UK-EU trade relationship and avoid special arrangements for Northern Ireland. Britain, however, objected to significant elements of the plan for Northern Ireland, effectively suspending talks until after the summit of EU leaders this week.According to the Financial Times, Mr Barnier told EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg of his vision for a “two tier” backstop that could be included in the withdrawal agreement to ensure an open border was always maintained between Northern Ireland and the State.\u0026nbspThis would include both a backstop for Northern Ireland alone, keeping it within the EU customs union and single market for goods, and alternative references to a UK-wide customs union.Any separate UK-EU customs arrangements would, however, have to take the form of a new treaty to be negotiated and agreed in full after Brexit. “The extension and two-tier backstop arrangement would only be offered if all other parts of the Withdrawal Agreement are reached,” said one official in the room.The FT quoted another diplomat, who said: “The extension is an example of how we could be flexible to help the British side if they want it.”\u0026nbspMr Barnier’s comments come as Mrs May prepares to address leaders of the EU27 on Wednesday evening in Brussels. She will then leave them to discuss the next steps on Brexit over dinner in her absence.Mr Barnier said the Brexit process must be “orderly for everyone and in all subjects – including Ireland”.Meanwhile, Germany’s Europe minister Michael Roth has urged Ms May to “take responsibility” for Brexit.“The situation is very serious . . . All involved must now look into whether the compromises made have been sufficient. For us, it is clear, we want a fair deal with the GB. But it must be a deal that preserves the integrity of the single market,” he said.Mr Roth said his message to Mrs May is, “take responsibility and be constructive”.While the UK was demanding “flexibility” from Brussels, the EU was limited in its room for manoeuvre because of the need to keep the Irish Border open, he said.“We can have either a smooth Brexit or rocky one,” said France’s EU affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau. “We all prefer a smooth one but we have to stand ready if there is no deal.”EU leaders have scrapped plans to discuss and publish a draft declaration this week on the bloc’s future trade deal with the UK after the derailment of the talks over the Border, in a blow to Ms May. An outline of an agreement was due to be “on the table” at a summit dinner of leaders on Wednesday night. When Brexit secretary Dominic Raab refused to sign off on an agreement on the Border have carefully choreographed plans came to a halt.Mrs May briefed her senior ministers in an extended session of cabinet ahead of Wednesday’s crunch meeting.There was strong support from cabinet ministers for Mrs May’s insistence that any Brexit deal must maintain the integrity of the union and cannot keep the UK indefinitely in a backstop customs arrangement, said Mrs May’s spokesman.Mr Barnier said he hopes a deal with Britain is possible “in the coming weeks”.With no likelihood of a deal this week, a special Brexit summit is expected to be scheduled for November. But it remains unclear whether this will be framed as a final opportunity to reach agreement or as a chance for the 27 to make preparations for a disorderly no-deal withdrawal.The prime minister told the House of Commons on Monday that an exit agreement is still “achievable”.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said because the UK is “determined to leave the customs union and the single market, because the UK says it wants bilateral trade deals” the Government must insist on the backstop.This is “to protect the island of Ireland and the two jurisdictions on it, ensuring . . . normality between communities trading with each other, that that isn’t undermined as an unintended consequence of Brexit,” he said.Speaking ahead of a private meeting on Tuesday in Luxembourg with Mr Barnier, the Tánaiste said he is confident that the Barnier taskforce, and Mr Barnier himself, “will deliver a deal that is consistent with what’s already been committed to in these negotiations, which is not an unreasonable ask”.Mr Coveney is meeting with Mr Barnier to discuss the current state of play in negotiations. And in particular talks on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop on avoiding a hard border.“Our bottom line on this is that we must have a backstop in the withdrawal treaty,” said Mr Coveney. “That backstop cannot be time limited in terms of an end date. It needs to be there unless and until something better is negotiated and agreed.” – Additional reporting agencies.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Ognen TeofilovskiFile PhotoReutersThe referendum in Macedonia on September 30th was a massive Yes vote for a change of name to “Republic of North Macedonia”, but the low turnout (less than 40 per cent) is being interpreted as, in effect, a No vote by the 60 per cent who abstained. Nevertheless, there remain huge domestic issues in this context for neighbouring Greece, most of them the legacy of its long history.If the Macedonian parliament accepts the referendum result and amends its constitution to remove what many Greeks see as irredentist claims on parts of historic Macedonia that remain in Greece, then the Greeks in their turn must accept that change. But Anel, the nationalist minor partner in the current Athens coalition, will oppose this, precipitating a collapse of government and a general election.History, that cruel parent, raises its head with the question: do the Greeks accept “North Macedonia”, when the new country represents only 50 per cent of historic Macedonia, with 40 per cent still in northern Greece (including Thessaloniki, which has been part of Greece since only 1913), and another 10 per cent in Bulgaria. It is more than a polite – or politic – bow to the lessons of history, since it also calls into question the bigger issue of what makes Greeks Greek. The agreement that will be voted on in the Skopje and Athens parliaments recognises the Macedonian language and ethnicity as givens, but this is disputed by many Greeks, who declare “Macedonia is Greek”.The Greek insistence on the relevance of ancient history is even being described as “fake news”, as if it were a red herring to confuse the modern-day issues. But there are history lessons still waiting to be learned.Almost 100 years ago, in 1921-22, with the encouragement of Britain and France, Greece invaded Turkey, in the belief that it had a right to do so under international treaties. This was to be the culmination of the Megali Idea or Great Concept, a process of enlargement of territory with the Trumpish slogan “Make Greece Great Again”.It was a total disaster, as the Turkish army not only inflicted a humiliating defeat on the Greeks but also destroyed the largely Greek city of Smyrna (today’s Izmir) and caused the evacuation of more than one million ethnic Greeks from western Turkey (Anatolia).But in addition to increasing Greece’s population 25 per cent, the Anatolian Catastrophe, as the events of 1922 have become known, split Greece down the middle because the national ideas of restoration and expansion had been shown to be false, bringing into question issues such as identity and purpose in a state not yet 100 years old. In its wake came a series of domestic and international catastrophes, including a dictatorship in 1935, the second World War, the civil war of 1945-49 and the military junta of 1967-74. In a sense, these (with the obvious exception of the world war) can be traced back to the 1922 disaster. And the Megali Idea still hasn’t gone away.Greece’s central position in the Balkans makes its relations with all its neighbours – Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey and Cyprus – susceptible to influence by the superpowers, especially when its porous and fragile borders are concerned. Greece and Macedonia, then as now, are the playthings of the superpowers manipulating relationships in the Balkans and the Levant.Following the economic crisis since 2010, there is another enforced Greek migration, but this time it is outward: at least 500,000 young people have left Greece since 2008, due not only to economic deprivation and the near impossibility of finding worthwhile employment at a living wage, but also to the disillusion that successive governments seem to offer neither care nor concern for their welfare. This “brain drain” is depriving Greece of its future.Greece urgently needs a new future, but at the same time it threatens to deny that privilege to its northern neighbour. The creation, at last, of a “Republic of North Macedonia”, makes it even clearer that the long-standing and profoundly disturbing question of Greek identity is once more a national and international breaking point.The outcome of the votes in the Skopje and Athens parliaments affects not only the relationship between the two states but also whether or not Macedonia can proceed to membership of Nato and the EU, openly advocated by the US.Russia, for its part, is allegedly making efforts to affect the outcome in order to keep the state within the Russian orbit of influence, so really nothing much has changed since Russia supported Greek independence, at the expense of the Ottomans, back in the 1820s. We may, with the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s, have brought an end to military confrontations in the Balkans, but diplomacy is no respecter of borders and employs other means than the gun to achieve its aims. Whether this will lead to another “catastrophe” is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3666395.1539780672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may knows she cannot rely on dup votes mich%C3%A9al martin says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnti-brexit protestors wave flags outside the Houses of Parliament in London. Photograph: Henry NichollsReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May has hinted that she realises that she may not be able to rely on the votes of the DUP for her Brexit proposals, Fianna Fáil leader Michéal Martin has told journalists in Brussels. Mr Martin also said he was seeking an assurance from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he would not call an election while the talks are ongoing.He said that the DUP’s role in obstructing agreement was “not in best interests of Northern Ireland in terms of citizens, in terms of businesses, in terms of agri-food”.He said pulling Northern Ireland out of the European market made no sense from an economic point of view. “Unionist politicians need to stand back from the larger constitutional issues that are not threatened.”The backstop would provide the North with the “best of both world in terms of access to the EU single market and the British market”. It was an opportunity.The Fianna Fáil leader, who is in Brussels to meet fellow leaders of the Liberal group ALDE, said he would thank them for their strong continuing support for Ireland’s position and would explain his pledge to Fine Gael not to bring down the Government during the Brexit process.“I’m saying if the British parliament does not succeed in ratifying a deal, there would be a crisis at that point for our country. So, it’s vital that there would be a Government there to deal with that because there would be immediate damage done to our economy,” Mr Martin said, replying in Irish to questions from journalists.“So, at the very least, I’m looking for agreement from Leo Varadkar not to have any election before that decision is taken by the British parliament.”Mr Martin noted that the deadline for ratification by Westminster of any EU-UK Brexit deal is now January 21st, 2019. He said that discussions have begun between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on a possible extension of their confidence and supply arrangement which has now expired. He warned that a no deal would be “catastrophic” for both sides and welcomed the idea of extending the transition from two years to three as an opportunity and space for the UK to think hard about its interests. He believed that the talks problems are “not insurmountable”. Negotiators were now down to the last 10 per cent of issues.Earlier, Tánaiste and Minister for Finance Simon Coveney said the backstop is very unlikely to be used. He said the Government needed to “hold its head” and be firm as Brexit negotiations continue.“We need to show flexibility, but cannot compromise on the issue of a physical border,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.Mr Coveney commented on the reported proposal to extend the two-year Brexit transition period by one year to provide more time to develop a temporary customs arrangement between the EU and UK.He said the aim was to give the British government the reassurance that the backstop to avoid a hard border is unlikely to ever be used because they will now have time to find a solution.Mr Coveney said there should be a special Summit specifically on Brexit in mid-November.“Time is moving on, we’re getting under time pressure,” he said.He said it is very frustrating to hear debates from Westminster about the backstop when it had already been agreed.“We don’t want the back stop to ever be used. It is insurance.”He said that Ireland will never agree to a back stop with an end date. “This is where the process is stuck, but there is a way around this.”The negotiations are very complex and difficult, Mr Coveney added.Meanwhile, reports that the EU may be willing to offer the UK a year’s extension to its transition out of the EU to placate the opponents of the Irish backstop were being treated sceptically this morning by EU diplomats.A senior diplomat said that any readiness to consider an extension to transition - the UK would have to ask for it - is not related to the backstop but to problems the UK has with designing an alternative to the Customs Union. Crucially, they say, any extension would not remove the necessity for a binding backstop, but simply postpone its implementation to allow more time for negotiation of a comprehensive alternative. Such an alternative would have to be, in the words of Mr Coveney, “better” than the backstop in terms of safeguarding a frictionless border in Ireland. Several UK negotiating red lines make that unlikely, even with an additional year of negotiation. The reports late last night suggested EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier was prepared to offer a one year extension to the UK’s transition to allow talks to proceed to reassure DUP opponents of any measures that would create a trade barrier between Britain and Northern Ireland that an eventual backstop implementation would be unlikely to be necessary. But it is understood that if any such offer were made, the insistence of the EU on a backstop guarantee insurance, effectively keeping just Northern Ireland in the Customs Union, would remain.It is likely, moreover, that any extension of transition would provoke fierce opposition from Tory backbench Brexiteers who will see it as delaying the UK’s opportunity to strike out on the world stage making exciting new trade deals for itself.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The backstop is an insurance policy that the EU and UK have agreed to include in the withdrawal agreement to avoid this happening. Both sides see it as a last resort to be triggered in the event of no better solution being found to avoid a hard border in a EU-UK trade deal. But there is a sequencing problem: a withdrawal treaty must be agreed before a trade deal, hence the need for the backstop first.

Photograph: Reuters Frank AugsteinAs Theresa May prepares to address EU leaders before dinner at Wednesday’s summit in Brussels, both sides are determined that there should be no repeat of the rancorous displays at Salzburg last month. Michel Barnier said on Tuesday that the Brexit negotiations needed more time while May told her cabinet that negotiators had made significant progress and that a deal was achievable.Still unresolved, however, is the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop, which Donald Tusk on Tuesday compared to the Gordian Knot unravelled by Alexander the Great.“It looks like a new version of the Gordian Knot,” Tusk said. “Unfortunately, I can’t see a new version of Alexander the Great. It’s not so easy to find this kind of creative leader.”Britain wants a customs backstop covering the whole of the UK to be included in the legally binding withdrawal agreement and it wants that backstop to be time-limited. The EU says a time limit would rob the backstop of its effectiveness as an insurance policy, and insists that customs arrangements for the whole of the UK are part of the future relationship outlined in a non-binding political declaration.Britain argues that, if the EU can make an exception for Northern Ireland by allowing its customs relationship with the EU to be in the withdrawal agreement, it can do the same for the rest of the UK. The EU’s response is that, under article 50, the withdrawal agreement can cover issues concerned only with Britain’s orderly withdrawal from the EU.The threat of violence and political disorder in Northern Ireland would threaten that orderly withdrawal. But the withdrawal agreement also covers such issues as geographical indicators for food products such as Parma ham and champagne.Although Britain continues to insist that the backstop should be time-limited, the cabinet on Tuesday discussed a “mechanism” that would bring it to an end. This suggests that London could accept some kind of escape clause which gives neither side a veto on ending the backstop but sets out a series of steps that should bring it to an end.The Gordian Knot was a labyrinthine tangle remarkable for its complexity and for the fact that it left no loose ends visible, which Alexander simply sliced through with his sword – an option that is not available where the backstop is concerned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Why isn\u0027t this in England?She later added: “I was instantly captivated by its atmosphere and by the amazing work that goes on there. It is a center of excellence and should be protected and cherished.”Greg Brostrom and John Harrell in RIchard IIIThe company began life as a travelling repertory group in 1988, when Jim Warren and Ralph Alan Cohen founded the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express to perform the playwright’s work in towns along Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley.In 1996 the company travelled to Britain to stage work in primary and secondary schools, returning in 2009 to take part in events at Shakespeare’s Globe on London’s South Bank, which its founders still regard as “our big brother”.Ten years after the touring company was founded it decided to create a permanent base in Staunton, where the liberal arts students of Mary Baldwin University provided a regular and appreciative audience.In 2001 Shenandoah Shakespeare began work on recreating as a base for the company Shakespeare’s original Blackfriars Playhouse, which was sited until its demolition in 1655 near what is now the edge of the City of London.The original building was a Tudor renovation of a 13th Century hall and was the fourth largest meeting space in the City, capable of holding 500 people. Parliament even met there on occasion.But with no reliable records of what Blackfriars Playhouse looked like, or even its basic dimensions, architect Tom McLaughlin had to rely on plans for other 17th century theatres, surviving halls from the period, Shakespeare’s own stage directions and the work of scholars and historians.The Blackfriars Playhouse cost $3.7 million to complete and the result is a breathtaking evocation of a 16th century London theatre in the most unlikely of locations.The town of Staunton sits beneath the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, close to some of the most bitterly contested sites of the American Civil War, including Lexington, Fredericksburg and Appomattox, the scene of the Confederacy’s eventual surrender on April 9, 1865.Indeed local legend has it that the only reason Staunton escaped the destruction that befell so many other towns as the warring armies crisscrossed Virginia, was that it was home to dozens of prostitutes who entertained the soldiers of both sides.Though Shakespeare himself might well have made something of that paradox, today’s bawdy entertainment is more likely to be found in a production of The Merry Wives of Windsor or As You Like it.A unique feature of performances at the Blackfriars Playhouse is the decision to stage each production under the bright lights of a dozen candelabras, recreating the lighting conditions seen in the time of Shakespeare and his contemporaries Ben Jonson and Christopher Marlowe.Up close and personal: The audience watch Shunté Lofton and Allie Babich in As You Like It“Shakespeare’s actors could see their audience our actors can see you,” states the playhouse’s 20182019 season programme. “Leaving you in the dark can literally obscure a vital part of the drama.”In keeping with what is known of performances of the period there are no special effects or elaborate set designs to detract from the actors and their material. Stools and benches placed on the stage for members of the audience emphasise a sense of interactions between performers and observers.The rest of the 300-strong audience sit directly in front of the stage and in two wooden galleries around the edge of the auditorium, just as they would have at the original Blackfriars Playhouse, 400 years ago and nearly 4,000 miles away across the sea.Mr Cohen, now Director of Mission at the American Shakespeare Center, said: “The American Shakespeare scene is vigorous and growing, and it\u0027s almost a grassroots movement.  “As to the likelihood of Staunton being a center for that movement, it\u0027s fair to point out that the two largest Shakespeare companies in North America are Stratford, Ontario, and Ashland, Oregon, both with populations smaller than Staunton\u0027s.He added: “Staunton, which from the 19th century has had a rich and deep history in the performing arts, is a beautiful small city the Shenandoah Valley, a city celebrated for its architecture and setting. In short, the perfect place for a Shakespeare getaway.”Please review our commenting policyBrexit live: Britons may need visas to visit France in \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 scenario- latest newsComment: A lot of MPs don’t bother going to PMQs any more.

Protesters had free rein, attacking our vehicle.  Saritha Balan, a journalist from online publication The News Minute, was kicked by protesters while accompanying devotees trying to access the site, she told Indian TV, while camera crews from several other channels had their vehicles vandalised.Police said around 500 police, including 100 women officers, had been deployed at Nilakkal.Nobody will be allowed to prevent anybody. We will do everything possible to implement the law of the land, said Inspector General of Police Manoj Abraham. None will be allowed to take law into their hands.The fundamentalist Hindu Shiv Sena party, a staunch ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party-led federal government, backs the campaigners. However, Kerala\u0027s Communist government, which runs the state along secular lines, has pledged to uphold the court ruling.The Sabrimala pilgrimage is one of the world’s largest, with some 20 million Hindu devotees annually visiting the centuries old temple.  The pilgrims can be easily identified as they dress in blue or black, do not shave until their quest is complete and smear sandal paste on their foreheads as a symbol of holiness. Many pilgrims undertake a vow of celibacy for 41 days before undertaking the arduous eight-mile long hilly trek, in a bid to earn the deity’s blessings.Please review our commenting policyBrexit live: Britons may need visas to visit France in \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 scenario- latest newsComment: A lot of MPs don’t bother going to PMQs any more.

The latest official figures have shown that inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in September\u0026nbspa day after they revealed wages rose by 3 per cent. So rising real incomes. Hooray!\u0026nbspBut that\u0027s not true for everyone, and\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking here about those in the bottom half of the UK\u0027s income distribution.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHere’s why: The September inflation figure is a particularly important one for them because it is used to calculate increases to\u0026nbspbenefit payments. Except that, absent a change in heart from the Chancellor, there will be no increase in the coming\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspBrexit already hurting UK economy and no-deal risks recessio, says OBRDUP ready to block budget if May compromises further on BrexitTheresa May has left Hammond with little to reveal in his BudgetJobseekers Allowance, Universal Credit, Child Benefit, tax credits, Housing Benefit and others will remain flat as a result of the fourth and (one would hope) final year of the Government’s benefits freeze.\u0026nbspThe September inflation figure has made it possible to calculate the\u0026nbspimpact of this\u0026nbspon, say, a low income family with kids and the Resolution Foundation has done so. The\u0026nbspfreeze\u0027s final year\u0026nbspwill, it says, cost one of those families £200 on average. The combined impact over the full four years comes to\u0026nbsp£580. \u0026nbspFor those just about managing, or not managing at all, that represents a gut punch.\u0026nbspThe policy will have\u0026nbsprealised savings of £4.4bn for the exchequer by the end of next year, of which the final year of the freeze is due to\u0026nbspcontribute £1.5bn.\u0026nbspTo give that a bit of context, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that another freeze, the one fuel duty\u0026nbspin place since the 2010-2011 financial year, and extended by Theresa May, costs the Treasury £9bn a year.\u0026nbsp“A car is not a luxury,” the PM declared when she announced it. But it is the wealthy with petrol eating luxury cars that will benefit the most.\u0026nbspIf the Chancellor were to increase the levy there would be more money in his coffers, and thus less need to skewer the poor to pay for it, which is what his party has\u0026nbspbeen doing. Being on the breadline in Tory Britain must sometimes feel a bit like spending an hour in a locked garage with one of those fancy cars while its engine is running.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

The latest official figures have shown that inflation fell to 2.4 per cent in September\u0026nbspa day after they revealed wages rose by 3 per cent. So rising real incomes. Hooray!\u0026nbspBut that’s not true for everyone, and\u0026nbspI’m talking here about those in the bottom half of the UK’s income distribution.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHere’s why: the September inflation figure is a particularly important one for them because it is used to calculate increases to\u0026nbspbenefit payments. Except that, absent a change in heart from the chancellor, there will be no increase in the coming\u0026nbspyear.\u0026nbspBrexit already hurting UK economy and no-deal risks recessio, says OBRDUP ready to block budget if May compromises further on BrexitTheresa May has left Hammond with little to reveal in his BudgetJobseekers allowance, universal credit, child benefit, tax credits, housing benefit and others will remain flat as a result of the fourth and (one would hope) final year of the government’s benefits freeze.\u0026nbspThe September inflation figure has made it possible to calculate the\u0026nbspimpact of this\u0026nbspon, say, a low income family with kids and the Resolution Foundation has done so. The\u0026nbspfreeze’s final year\u0026nbspwill, it says, cost one of those families £200 on average. The combined impact over the full four years comes to\u0026nbsp£580. \u0026nbspFor those just about managing, or not managing at all, that represents a gut punch.\u0026nbspThe policy will have\u0026nbsprealised savings of £4.4bn for the exchequer by the end of next year, of which the final year of the freeze is due to\u0026nbspcontribute £1.5bn.\u0026nbspTo give that a bit of context, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has estimated that another freeze, the one fuel duty has had in place since the 2010-11 financial year, and extended by Theresa May, costs the Treasury £9bn a year.\u0026nbsp“A car is not a luxury,” the prime minister\u0026nbspdeclared when she announced it. But it is the wealthy with petrol eating luxury cars that will benefit the most.\u0026nbspIf the chancellor were to increase the levy there would be more money in his coffers, and thus less need to skewer the poor to pay for it, which is what his party has\u0026nbspbeen doing. Being on the breadline in Tory Britain must sometimes feel a bit like spending an hour in a locked garage with one of those fancy cars while its engine is running.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Show’s over, they declared, and investors switched off the stock as if it were a bad drama, knocking 15 per cent of its value.\u0026nbspToday it’s hotter than third season of Stranger Things (would you just give us a release date?), with Netflix having smashed both Wall Street’s and its own subscriber forecasts.\u0026nbspIf anyone needed a(nother) demonstration of the folly of paying too much attention to a single shaky set of three month numbers it’s here.\u0026nbspNetflix shares soar after subscriber growth surges at a record rateThe sure-fire hits and movies you might have missed on NetflixIron Fist has been cancelled by NetflixNetflix’s guidance called for 5m net new subscribers to be added to the pile during the last quarter. The number came in at a smidgeon under 7m, a new record for the July to September period.\u0026nbsp“As a reminder the quarterly guidance we provide is our internal forecast at the time we report and we strive for accuracy in our forecast,” said boss Reed Hastings, in anticipation of taking flak for the company’s prior pessimism. “This means in some quarters we will be high and other quarters low relative to our guidance.”To under promise, over deliver, is smart. The trouble is that Netflix took it to such an extent that it’s made itself look a little silly, particularly given that there were good reasons for thinking that the third quarter would be better than the disappointing second.\u0026nbspIts slate looked a lot stronger for a start, with original content highlights including a new season of Orange Is The New Black, one of its flagships, as well as another run out for animated comedy BoJack Horseman and the second season of crime drama Ozark.\u0026nbspNetflix continues to invest heavily in its own shows, with more than a quarter of the $8bn it is spending on content going to the home team. That means it’s burning through cash at quite a clip, but the move is wise.\u0026nbspCompetition for externally produced fare is hotting up with a raft of new entrants seeking to join the streaming party, some in the US, but plenty elsewhere too. They may make it more expensive to buy things in, and could chip away at Netflix’s numbers,\u0026nbspBut with the way it’s steaming ahead, and with\u0026nbspthe performance of Netflix originals at the Emmys, there is every reason to believe that the streaming giant will cope.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Part of the reason for that\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspthe firm’s forecast for the fourth quarter, which calls for 9.4m new additions.\u0026nbspThat looks quite challenging, and could be seen as a reaction by Mr Hastings to the low ball third quarter estimate. He’ll get kicked again if he fails to deliver on it, regardless of his warning over putting too much faith in internal forecasts.\u0026nbspSo will the stock.\u0026nbspSo do yourself a favour and write this out 100 times: I will not fixate on the quarterly numbers. Then write it out again.

Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.

The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits.

We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The campaign group compared figures for government revenues from the CIA World Fact Book with company revenues from the Fortune 500 in order to highlight the growing financial clout of large firms.\u0026nbspThose fighting for human rights should receive the Nobel Peace PrizeLondon-listed Royal Dutch Shell is the fifth-largest firm in the rankings and the second-biggest publicly listed company in the world by revenue, behind Chinese oil company Sinopec.Shell’s $311bn\u0026nbsp(£237bn) revenues dwarf those collected by most countries in the world, including Mexico, Belgium and Russia, putting the oil major just behind South Korea, a country of more than 50 million people.It comes as UN officials meeting in Geneva this week debate a binding treaty seeking to hold transnational corporations to account for human rights abuses around the world.Campaigners are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The UK, which currently sits on the UN human rights council, has traditionally been hostile to the treaty, which is supported by Ecuador, South Africa and a number of other developing countries.Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said the vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of global problems including inequality and climate change.\u0026nbsp“The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Yet there are very few ways that citizens can hold these corporations to account for their behaviour. Rather, through trade and investment deals, it is corporations which are able to demand that governments do their bidding.\u0026nbsp“The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business.\u0026nbsp“Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN. That’s why today we’re joining campaigns from across the world to tell the British government not to block this international demand for justice.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Shares in the company plummeted by more than a third after the firm issued the profit warning. The group said consumer demand in both domestic and continental markets has weakened in recent weeks, and said it now expects this to continue in the second half. Combined with increased fuel costs and the continued weakness of the pound, will lead to an estimated £29m dent in profits. The company now predicts that it will report a pre-tax loss of £12m for the current financial year. Flybe abandons a planeload of passengers in ItalyBeast from the East wipes £4m off FlyBe revenues Airline competition has benefited passengers, but there are limitsFlybe: “On a path to sustainable profitability” despite higher costsChristine Ourmières-Widener, chief executive officer, said: “We have made progress in driving our unit revenues across the summer season, but we are now seeing a softening in the market. \u0026nbspWe are reviewing further capacity and cost saving measures while continuing to focus on delivering our sustainable business improvement plan.“Stronger cost discipline is starting to have a positive impact across the business, but we aim to do more in the coming months, particularly against the headwinds of currency and fuel costs. We continue to strengthen the underlying business and remain confident that our strategy will improve performance.Analysts at Liberum said there are opportunities for Flybe to help itself, noting that the airline could increase revenue by putting in place new commercial systems, but said any attempts at self-help would be “more than offset” by current challenges linked to exchange rates and fuel prices. Earlier this year, Flybe said the Beast from the East had wiped £4m off its revenues, due to flight cancellations and delays and airport closures. Severe cold weather in February and March threw many people’s travel plans off track as snow, ice and strong winds wreaked havoc across the UK and Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Rather than Chrome and Google search, as users have seen ever since Android was introduced, there could be something else entirely.The change is good news for other browsers and search engines, which could now come pre-installed on Android phones instead of Chrome.Given recent data scandals from tech firms like Facebook and Google, device manufacturers may decide to make a statement by introducing apps that focus on online privacy.Private search engine DuckDuckGo could be among those to benefit, which currently represents only 0.18 per cent of the global search market.The privacy-focussed search engine processes around 30 million searches per day – the same number as Google handles in about 15 minutes.What does this mean for Google\u0027s mobile dominance?More than 80 per cent of the world\u0027s smartphones run the Android operating system, and this is unlikely to change significantly as a result of Google\u0027s new licensing system.What could change is the pervasiveness of its search engine, apps and other features. Perhaps the\u0026nbspmost significant of the features subject to the fees is the Play Store, which serves as a gateway through which popular apps can be downloaded.Not all apps are available through Google Play – earlier this year, Epic Games decided to roll out the Android version of its hugely popular game Fortnite\u0026nbspthrough its own website in order to avoid paying\u0026nbspGoogle for the privilege of hosting the app on Google Play.\u0026nbspBut this is an exception, not the rule.If the licensing fees prove too burdensome for phone and tablet manufacturers, this way of distributing apps may become a trend that threatens Google\u0027s monopoly of everything from email to maps.Google admits giving hundreds of firms access to your Gmail inboxEven without Google Play, Fortnite was able to amass more than 15 million downloads on Android within a month of launching, proving Google\u0027s app store is not a prerequisite for success.As Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney explained at the time: The great thing about the internet and the digital revolution is that this is possible, now that physical storefronts and middlemen distributors are no longer required.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Huawei\u0027s timetable sees two main releases a year, with the bigger-screen Mate Series taking the autumn slot. So, what\u0027s new?Quite a lot actually, and while some manufacturers seem to offer incremental upgrades every six or 12 months, the Mate 20 Pro is stuffed to the gills with innovation, including a super-cool reverse wireless charging feature. But I\u0027m getting ahead of myself.The new phone is clearly related to the industrial design of the P20 Pro but has a significantly more elegant finish.

But to the flat of your finger it feels entirely smooth.Huawei says this should make the phone grippier and less prone to fingerprints and calls it a \u0027hyperoptical\u0027 pattern.The glass has been treated to have a shimmering, colour-changing effect depending on how you hold it. Most attractive of these is midnight blue which looks classy and businesslike without being dull. Emerald green has a similar shimmer and there\u0027s also pink gold and twilight black.The screen stretches almost to the bottom of the phone. It\u0027s not quite to the base but unlike the P20 Pro, there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor at the base of the phone, which we\u0027ll come back to in a moment.There is a notch at the top of the display, with front-facing camera for facial recognition and, inevitably, for selfies.The rear of the phone is dominated by a three-camera set-up, like the P20 Pro. But, here, Huawei has placed the three cameras and flash in a square arrangement which is strikingly different from rivals. And the company has gone to a lot of trouble with the design here, too. The square in which the cameras sit is edged with four rounded corners which perfectly match the curved corners of the phone itself.The camera square is the only detail on the back of the phone, apart from the company name down towards the bottom. It means there\u0027s a spare, strong look to the design.And this phone is waterproof to a level of IP68, which means it can sit in 2 metres of water for half an hour safely.So, you\u0027ll have noticed there\u0027s no fingerprint sensor on the rear of the phone, nor at the base of the display. You can unlock the handset with facial recognition, which works reasonably quickly.But there\u0027s a much cooler way to do it.The Mate 20 Pro has a fingerprint sensor built right into the display, buried in the middle of the screen. When you lift the phone, the lock screen has a fingerprint icon which shows you where to press. Not only does it work well and very quickly, it\u0027s amazingly satisfying to use.Huawei has put this technology into a phone before, and rumours suggest other handsets will have it, and soon, but in any event, it\u0027s a great feature that could almost be enough to tempt you on its own.Which brings us to the coolest feature of all, and a genuine full-on innovation. This phone is capable of wireless charging, as many others are. A charging coil in the back of the phone receives the power from a wireless charging pad.But Huawei has somehow managed to create a phone which can give as well as take. If your phone is capable of wireless charging and you are running out of battery power, well, I can help. By pressing your phone against the back of mine, the Huawei charges your handset. A haptic buzz confirms the connection and it feels little short of magic.Because Qi wireless charging is an open standard, you\u0027re not restricted to other Huawei Mate 20s, when it comes to sharing your battery. I\u0027ve tested this against an iPhone XS Max and it works perfectly.Sure, it\u0027s not as fast as a plugged-in charger, but it\u0027s pretty amazing. It requires a flick of a setting to turn it on, and if you don\u0027t charge it, the feature switches off after three minutes.At best, this will lead to a future full of generous battery sharing and at worst, well, there must be a cheesy chat-up line or two to be had out of all this, no?The phone will charge fast through regular wireless charging, Huawei says, and very fast through a wired charge – the company says it will go from flat to 70 per cent in 30 minutes, an increase over the P20 Pro which would reach 58 per cent in the same time.The battery is big, by the way, clocking in at 4200mAh, so it should run a full day with ease.The Mate 20 Pro boasts a 7nm processor (nm means nanometre). This is quite an achievement. Apple has a 7nm processor in its latest phones but, Huawei points out, it was the first to announce it, even if the phone is coming to market a little later.The benefits of a 7nm processor? Well, it promises to be faster and more power-efficient.This was what set the P20 Pro apart from pretty much every other cameraphone. Leica\u0027s involvement was crucial to this. It included a sensor with a whopping 40MP resolution, a black-and-white sensor to grab detail quickly even in low light and a separate 8MP sensor which effectively offered 3x optical zoom.This time, the monochrome sensor has been replaced by an ultra-wide-angle 20MP colour one. Huawei says the sensors are now so fast, there\u0027s no need for the monochrome, though I suspect it means that if you want to shoot in black-and-white, you\u0027ll get images which are decent rather than, as before, outstanding. Mind you, black-and-white isn\u0027t a priority for most people.The 8MP sensor remains at a focal length which gives an effective 3x optical zoom and the Ultra-wide is a 20MP camera which is 0.6x the zoom of the wide-angle lens. This lens is also exceptional for close-up shots, Huawei says, allowing you to get as close as 2.5cm from your subject.All these make for a potentially very powerful camera, and that\u0027s before we\u0027ve talked about AI.Huawei Mate 10: An AI phone designed to think like a humanHuawei uses artificial intelligence heavily in its cameras, using scene settings to improve the photographic results. So, if it\u0027s a dog you’re photographing, it fluffs up Fido\u0027s fur, but if it\u0027s a cat, Tibbles\u0027 eyes will be enhanced.This use of AI should mean you can trust to the automatic settings of the camera and concentrate on capturing the moment and framing your shot.The front-facing camera is a 24MP model capable of wider selfies than some, so you can all squeeze in.There\u0027s a lot to like in the Mate 20 Pro, from the snazzy cameras to attention-grabbing features like the in-screen fingerprint sensor and the brilliant reverse wireless charging.Huawei\u0027s special version of Android software hasn\u0027t always met with positive reaction, though this version certainly looks better, and it remains to be seen how effective the AI turns out to be, beyond improving the photos, but there\u0027s no doubt this is an imaginative and innovative handset. The phone is out soon and costs £899.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Twitter and Google have taken the same approach as Apple and added some kind of filling to their bagels, for instance, but have kept them closed Microsoft and Samsung\u0027s bagels are both plain, but they are cut open like Apple\u0027s one.Emoji that vary can cause genuine problems when people use them for communication. A 2016 study found a significant discrepancy in what the different emoji seem to communicate, and warned that it could lead to serious confusion when people send them across various platforms.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally these kinds of structures are known at lower redshifts, which means when the Universe has had much more time to evolve and construct such huge things. It was a surprise to see something this evolved when the Universe was relatively young!The structure, which is known by scientists as Hyperion, was spotted by a team of scientists who used the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope to peer into the early universe and look for galaxies forming. It was then they spotted Hyperion, a colossal mass that is more than a million billion times that of the Sun.Vast cosmic explosions could be flinging gold across the universeIt is not only huge but very complex. Hyperion is made up of at least seven high-density regions, which are strung together by threads of galaxies. That structure is different to the kind of superclusters we usually see closer to us, even though the size is similar.Superclusters closer to Earth tend to a much more concentrated distribution of mass with clear structural features, explains Brian Lemaux, an astronomer from University of California, Davis and LAM, and a member of the team behind this result. But in Hyperion, the mass is distributed much more uniformly in a series of connected blobs, populated by loose associations of galaxies.The difference is probably a consequence of the fact that the closer by superclusters have had billions of years of being pushed into denser regions by galaxies. Hyperion, which is much younger, has been subject to that process much less.Eventually, Hyperion will probably evolve into something similar to those structures: the kind that make up the Sloan Great Wall, or the Virgo Supercluster in which our own galaxy sits. Understanding how that process happens could allow us to peer into the past of our own galaxy and understand how it might have formed.Understanding Hyperion and how it compares to similar recent structures can give insights into how the Universe developed in the past and will evolve into the future, and allows us the opportunity to challenge some models of supercluster formation, said\u0026nbspCucciati. Unearthing this cosmic titan helps uncover the history of these large-scale structures.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If such an event took place today it would likely disrupt much of the planet’s communication technology.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The string of numbers – which looks like a hexadecimal string of the kind used in programming –\u0026nbsppresumably refers to a part of Twitter\u0027s code, which would normally be swapped out for something that a human can read but is failing to do so because of a bug.But users reported that the messages are showing even when they aren\u0027t expecting to receive a notification, and without one showing up in the notifications tab of the app.All of the messages appear to be appearing over recent minutes, and only seem to be appearing on iPhones. They are all unique.While they are a little concerning and odd, there\u0027s nothing to indicate that the message refers to any broader problem with the Twitter platform. A number of people took to the site to ask whether the strange notifications indicate they\u0027ve been hacked or refer to some other problem – but the vast number of them received in recent minutes suggests that is probably not the case.Some on Twitter joked about the difficult of trying to work out what the strange messages mean.But others just expressed surprise that people had notifications turned on for Twitter at all.Since this article was first published, Twitter confirmed to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat the bug should now be fixed.CEO Jack Dorsey posted that the company is working to understand why it happened, after he tweeted an earlier update that included a screengrab of the problem and was retweeted thousands of times.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is why we have created a dedicated team of over 400 staff to examine cases, and have paid back around £120m\u0026nbspso far.\u0026nbsp“We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It\u0027s causing immense hardship for many people wherever it is rolled out.It is hard to believe now, but UC was designed to lift people out of poverty and smooth the transition into work to ensure that it always pays. The reality is that UC is a vehicle for cuts.People were facing hunger and destitution, she said, as she called on the government to wake up ... open its eyes to what\u0027s happening and halt the rollout of the benefit.She said: So, will the Government publish all reports and analysis that it has carried out into the effects of UC since the Secretary of State took office? People have a right to know.Labour\u0027s motion is the latest proposed use of an arcane parliamentary procedure to make the vote binding on the government by issuing a humble address to the Queen asking her to require ministers to comply.It calls for any briefing papers or analysis provided to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions since January 8 2018 on the impact of the rollout of Universal Credit on recipients\u0027 and household income and on benefit debts to be laid before Parliament.Ms McVey insisted the rollout of Universal Credit would continue, but said she would ensure the Government get it right.We will make sure we get this benefit right. You know for why? Because the genuine concerns of the people on our backbenches want to get it right.She received backing from Tory Heidi Allen\u0026nbspwho said she and fellow backbenchers believe the Secretary of State is listening to what needs to change with Universal Credit.On\u0026nbspthe bullying row, Jeremy Corbyn distanced himself from comments made by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry over John Bercow\u0027s position.Ms Thornberry drew criticism for saying Mr Bercow should remain in place because of upcoming Brexit votes despite the release of a damning report into a culture of bullying and harassment at Westminster.A spokesman for the Labour leader said: Jeremy\u0027s view is that the issue of Brexit and the issue of bullying, harassment and abuse in Parliament, or any work place, are entirely separate, and shouldn\u0027t be confused in any way.Mr Corbyn\u0027s spokesman said that Ms Thornberry had made it clear she was expressing a personal view.If you are feeling frustrated by the Brexit process, why not join hundreds of thousands of people prepared to\u0026nbspmarch in central London\u0026nbspthis Saturday to demand a People’s Vote referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas been running its own\u0026nbspFinal Say\u0026nbspcampaign to demand the referendum, with more than 860,000 people having\u0026nbspsigned its petition\u0026nbspso far.Interesting development from the morning - The US administration has formally confirmed it intends to pursue a trade deal with the UK as soon as it is ready after leaving the EU.Donald Trump\u0027s trade representative Robert Lighthizer notified Congress of plans to open negotiations with the UK, as well as with the EU and Japan.Talks with the EU and Japan are intended to begin as soon as practicable, and certainly within 90 days, but the US-UK negotiations will have to wait until after the date of Brexit on March 29 next year.A bilateral trade deal with the US is regarded by Brexiteers as a major prize but discussions are likely to spark controversy over US demands for access to UK markets for GM crops, hormone-enhanced beef and chlorine-washed chicken.Earlier, Labour’s\u0026nbspBen Bradshaw raised the case of his constituent Matthew Hedges, who has been jailed in UAE on spying charges. Bradshaw says he was only doing academic research and asked government to intervene,May says the government is offering the student its support.Teresa Pierce, Labour MP, says she has a constituent who was being sexually harassed at work. How can she reassure her about going back to work if the employer is this Parliament?\u0026nbspMay says harassment and bullying is never acceptable and the woman must be allowed to come to work and be treated with respect.\u0026nbspIt comes in the wake of Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report on harassment and bullying in parliament, which was published this week.John Baron, Tory MP, asks about the Japanese PM\u0027s comments that the UK could join a major trade partnership after Brexit. Will the Common rulebook in her plan ruin this?\u0026nbspMay says she welcomes early discussion about this and seeks to reassure him that this is possible.Labour\u0027s Danielle Rowley says universal credit is pushing some women to stay with domestic abusers - which is \u0027disgusting\u0027. She asks how it makes the PM feel.\u0026nbspMay says the government is doing lots to combat domestic abuse.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is universally acknowledged that British music is one of this country’s biggest success stories, with UK artists releasing a staggering one\u0026nbspin 8 albums bought anywhere in the world.For musicians – the protestors include Jarvis Cocker and members of The Chemical Brothers, Super Furry Animals, Mogwai and Pink Floyd, among others – “being in the EU” has played a major part.They point out that no less than 60 per cent of revenues paid to the UK come from the EU, fuelled by a free sharing of data which is now under threat, and that the astonishing vinyl revival is at risk from higher import fees.But, for musicians, it’s much bigger than that. Music is and must be “about embracing and respecting other cultures”, they say – while Brexit will, inevitably, see Britain “isolate ourselves”.“Our concern is that new musicians won’t have the privileges that we had,” says Mr Singh, whose catchy number-one single “Brimful of Asha” was a key soundtrack of the\u0026nbsplate 1990s.Older musicians have grim memories of needing special permission to “get into countries when there wasn’t free movement, but that was a long time ago”, he says.He explains: “Britain is used as a base for touring France and Germany, but artists need to be able to get equipment and people over to Europe and the fear is that will stop because it will be too expensive.”But, for Mr Singh, leaving the EU goes so much deeper than his love for music, because his opposition is an ethos, a state of mind. “Cornershop were anti-Brexit even before Brexit was here,” he says.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchGrowing up in Wolverhampton, memories were fresh of Enoch Powell’s racist “Rivers of Blood” speech\u0026nbspin 1968, which claimed\u0026nbspimmigration would lead to violence and did so much damage to race relations.It’s a controversial view, but Mr Singh insists racism was a “motivation” for some who voted for Brexit, but argues people were also angered by years of cuts – which means they will feel betrayed.“These people won’t be satisfied by what happens after Brexit, because there will be yet more cuts to services, the country will be hobbled by Brexit,” he warns.Here he also targets Jeremy Corbyn for “failing to provide leadership by opposing Brexit”, while echoing claims that EU immigration has lowered workers’ wages here.“Corbyn has gone down the same line and said a lot of the rot that the Conservatives put out – and even Ukip,” Mr Singh protests.“Coming out of the EU is not what’s best for workers and workers’ rights. I find it incredible that Labour doesn’t realise that.”Mr Singh will also be marching because, with a French wife, “we have woken up every morning consumed by Brexit since the referendum”.I’m a former soldier who voted for Brexit- but now I regret itCorbyn under fresh pressure to back a Final Say Brexit referendum10,000 young people to lead major demo calling for fresh Brexit voteWhy so many Tory MPs are privately keen on a Final Say referendumShe quickly applied for UK citizenship, which means she is “a lot more secure than others”, but millions of EU citizens here remain fearful about their future rights.“I wonder why many EU citizens even want to stay in the country when you think how badly they have treated,” the singer says. “It is pitiful that it has got to this.”But, with Theresa May still insisting there will be no Final Say referendum – and Mr Corbyn fighting Labour pressure to back one – can Saturday’s march really achieve its aim?“I think so,” he insists. “One year ago, people laughed at the idea of a People’s Vote happening, but, as the truth has come out, the rupee has dropped and people are understanding we must find out what the country feels now.“We now have much more information and people can take a better-informed view about whether we want to leave the EU or not.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hererivers of bloodShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He said good progress had been made on the withdrawal agreement and on the future framework.Cabinet strongly supported the Prime Minister over the importance of maintaining the integrity of the union.Cabinet also agreed that we must be able to ensure that we cannot be kept in the backstop arrangement indefinitely.The PM said there will no doubt be challenging moments ahead, that is in the nature of negotiations.She said she is committed to ensuring a Brexit that delivers on the referendum results, safeguards jobs and security and which preserves our union.Before the Cabinet meeting, two ministers present at the pizza summit played down suggestions of rebellion against the Prime Minister.International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt told Sky News: No-one is planning on resigning.We are all doing our jobs and we are trying to get the best deal for this country, and that\u0027s it.Brexit news: The Irish border has been the biggest obstacle facing the UK (Image: )We are approaching the end of negotiations. This is going to be a difficult time, but the whole Cabinet is digging in to get the best deal for this country.And Mrs Leadsom said: The Prime Minister is doing a very, very complicated job and I\u0027m fully supporting her in getting that done.EU Council President Donald Tusk attempted to increase the pressure on Mrs May to come forward with new concrete proposals at the summit and claimed there were no grounds for optimism about the chances of a deal.As I see it, the only source of hope for a deal for now is the goodwill and determination on both sides, Mr Tusk told a Brussels press conference.However, for a breakthrough to take place, besides goodwill we need new facts.Tomorrow I am going to ask Prime Minister May whether she has concrete proposals on how to break the impasse. Only such proposals can determine if a breakthrough is possible.EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday said that more time was needed to find an agreement to deliver an orderly UK withdrawal and keep the Irish border open.We will take this time, calmly and seriously, to find this global agreement in the next weeks, he said.Germany\u0027s Europe minister, Michael Roth, said Berlin\u0027s message to Mrs May was: Take responsibility and be constructive.

And try out the windbag oratory on the .million decent British democrats who voted to leave the European Union, and who have been told ever since that they are racist, ignorant ­bigots who should never be allowed near a polling booth.I like Bono. In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away.

Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

just three months before we officially quit the EU.He told a Commons committee: It might be the case - we’ve seen how European negotiations work - that progress is made at October council, progress is made at the November council, and it is even as late as the December council before a deal is done.Obviously, everyone wants the deal to be done earlier.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt claimed one of the biggest threats to Brexit is Tory MPs like Boris Johnson who refuse to back Mrs Mays approach.He told the Daily Mail: Boris is a backbencher so he is free to say exactly as he thinks.But what I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether.I am sure that this is last thing Boris wants.The pro-EU veterans made a direct appeal to politicians across the EU, asking them to back calls for a second referendum.They wrote a joint opinion piece which appeared today in a number of European newspapers.The trio said: Our domestic debate is far from over and, even at this late hour, many of us are continuing to make the case that the British public need to make the final decision once we are in possession of all the relevant facts.So we ask our European partners to be ready to give us the space and time,necessary, to make such a final decision.They accused Brexiteers of being cynical pessimists who want to get a flimsy exit deal that they would later tear up in order to impose deregulation and tax cuts.The ex-PM and two former deputies have been blasted by Brexit-backing MPs who say they are undermining Britains negotiating position."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000442088992.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brits set for 230 a year pension boost and more money in your pocket as inflation drops","story":"Pensioners will see a boost of almost £ a week from next April, and hard-working families will start to feel an ease to the cost of living squeeze.Inflation fell to . per cent from . per cent last month, as food and drink cost less.It means hard-up Brits will have more money in their pockets as they gear up for Christmas shopping.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: Food was the main downward pull on inflation as last years September price rises failed to reappear, while ferry prices dropped after their surprisingly high summer peak.However, it wasnt all one-way traffic with energy suppliers pushing up their prices.And yesterday wages were shown to be rising by the fastest pace in nearly a decade -

[But]insufficient progress is there by November then the government will take stock, reflect, and the Prime Minister will decide at what point to say ‘this is our lead option’. Evena deal was struck on December - in Brussels it would still have to go to MPs and European parliaments for approval. By then No Deal plans would be well advanced.  Meanwhile there is fresh drama over Brexit, fresh splits in the Cabinet and fresh unrest in the Tory party:Jeremy Corbyn blasted Mrs May at PMQs for putting the Tory partys interests first, adding she is too weak and too ided to protect peoples jobs or our economy - or ensure there is no hard border in Northern Ireland. Britain faces paying almost all its poundbn orce bill in No Deal, the Chancellor warned the Cabinet. Philip Hammond reportedly said the nation would only save poundbn to poundbn due to legal liabilities. Today Mrs May refused to rule out having to hand over most of the sum. Liam Fox reportedly backed extending the transition period beyond December . The Brexiteer Trade Secretary is said to have made the comment at yesterdays Cabinet meeting, despite No saying it will not happen. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney backed a transition extension too, saying: The EU side is willing to allow more time in the transition period to agree an alternative solution to the backstop. Michael Gove accused officials of tricking him into accepting the last deal in December, saying: “Fool me once, shame on you fool me twice, shame on me.”Philip Hammond slapped down Boris Johnson saying: What I would say to Boris is be careful because there is a real danger thatall of us Conservative MPs do not stand behind the Prime Minister at a moment like this, the danger is that Brexit will be derailed altogether. The head of the Department of Health admitted medicine shortage fears keep him awake at night. The US confirmed Brexit trade deal talks will begin in MONTHS - igniting fresh fears of an influx of chlorine chicken. Tony Blair and Nick Clegg joined forces with an article urging EU leaders to give Britain the space and time for a second referendum.The Prime Minister will address  EU leaders chiefs tonight in Brussels before they tuck into dinner without her.  Mrs May is expected to urge her counterparts to ease their position over the Northern Ireland frontier, which is the biggest block to striking a deal. Negotiators reached stalemate over proposals for preventing a hard border with the Republic - the UK’s only land frontier with the EU -no deal can be agreed. EU chiefs want a “backstop” where Northern Ireland remains in the customs union, which would split it from the rest of the UK. The PM cannot back the move because the Democratic Unionist Party - on whose votes she relies - is bitterly opposed. Instead, Mrs May has said the whole UK could effectively stay in a temporary customs union - but refused to set an end date. That enrages Brexiteers who fear Britain would be banned from signing trade deals with other countries, forced to pump cash into the Brussels budget and have no say over new rules.  Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney told the BBC: “A lot of work has happened over the last two weeks that have actually found ways of closing gaps and getting agreement. But there are a small number of remaining issues. They are signicant issues, so we shouldn’t downplay them, that need to be resolved.” It had been hoped agreement could be reached, paving the way for a rubber-stamping summit next month. But Mr Coveney said: “I think what’s more likely is that dates will be suggested, but that there won’t be a commitment to a new summit unless there is a signal from the negotiating teams that there is something to sign off on. And I think that’s sensible. What we don’t want to do is create drama around the build-up to a new summit date and not actually have something to sign off on. Both sides want to get a deal done here, and I think we need... to allow the negotiating teams to set the pace with a view to making recommendations, hopefully by mid-November, that a new summit is necessary to sign off on a final deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"guide tricking bnp ukip supporters","story":"NewsGuide to tricking BNP and Ukip supporters into voting Green condemned by Theresa May at PMQsSolihull MP Julian Knight said theres no place for \"pandering to racism\" - and the Prime Minister agreedShareCommentsByJames RodgerMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video guide-tricking-bnp-supporters-voting-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Councillors guide to tricking BNP supporters into voting for the Green Party has been strongly condemned by Theresa May . The Green Party gave its activists hints about how to win votes from BNP supporters, the Birmingham Mail revealed today.They were told to encourage BNP supporters to go to the polling station, in the hope they would end up picking the Green candidate. The advice was contained in a detailed document called “How to Win an Election”, written by Chris Williams, the party’s Regional Manager for Elections and a councillor in Solihull. In a section on canvassing, the document invited activists to imagine they are in a seat where the Greens were challenging Labour, and explained how to responda voter said they backed the BNP or UKIP.  The document said: “If they say BNP or UKIP, then do not tell them that there is no BNP or UKIP candidatebutthey appear to be very anti-Labour, then we do want them to go to the polling station. “When they get there, they will see no BNP or UKIP candidate and so may vote Green instead.” Instead, activists were told to say: “Do you know you have  Labour Councillors in this area at the moment, which means they have the monopoly  [Candidate] has been working all year round - you have probably seen the newsletters – and so you may wish to consider voting for him in order to keep Labour out. It’s a two-horse race around here between Labour and [candidate].”The Green Party are the official opposition in Solihull, with  councillors. Nationwide they have one MP and are led by Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley. It was raised at Prime Ministers Questions today, by Tory Solihull MP Julian Knight. He asked Mrs May: Not long ago, we had the horror of three pig’s heads being left outside a Muslim community centre in Solihull. Then the EDL thugs came to my proud and multicultural town and we turned our backs on them. In this light, will the PM join me in condemning utterly the actions of a Solihull Green Councillor, as reported in the Birmingham Mail, who has written a guide on how to attract and trick BNP voters  He added: There is no place for pandering to racism in my town or in our politics.  Mrs May replied: I absolutely agree with him. There is no place in our society for pandering to racism of any sort. And we should send a very clear message of that from the whole of this house. The BNP currently has no elected representatives anywhere, though at one time it had more than  council seats nationwide. It is a party which believes in putting “British” people and also argues that only ethnic white Europeans can be British.A Green Party spokesperson said: “The document referred to is a now old guide to conversations on the doorsteps where we will encounter constituents from all political persuasions, who have voted in a iety of ways over the course of their voting lives.“The Green Party will always listen to voters on the doorstep and will not make judgements about them based on their voting intentions past or present. “We know that many people feel frustrated and disenfranchised by mainstream politics and have looked for an alternative.“The Green Party offers a solution of hope, not hate, and we are proud to have taken seats from UKIP, erased the BNP in Solihull and to offer an anti establishment alternative that can challenge the politics of hate.“Only by winning votes from the disenfranchised and changing the narrative can we defeat the far right, which the Green Party is helping to do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"its time applaud theresa mays","story":"NewsopinionIts time to applaud Theresa Mays incredible lack of achievementNever in the field of human endeavour has one person done so little for so longShareCommentsByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  OCT Newsopinion\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn  Winston Churchill said British airmen undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and mortal danger were turning the tide of the war. Never has so much been owed by so many to so few, he said. Today, you could say much the same of Theresa May, although shes not doing barrel rolls in a Spitfire. Churchill was praising The Few who kept the Nazis at bay in the Battle of Britain, just long enough that the country could regroup and fight on for another  years.Theresa has spent two years winging it. She has dodged incoming fire from her own side, skirmished with the enemy across the Channel, fought a general election and all while faced with an hopeless and daunting task shamefully abandoned by the previous Prime Minister. Brexit is not just unlikely, its impossible. The country voted for the entire United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and Northern Ireland cannot leave without the United Kingdom ceasing to exist. Either Northern Ireland remains, which would makes the vote invalid, or the UK breaks up, which makes it moot.Most people who faced that ever-decreasing circle of hell for two years would go completely mad. We should be proud, as a nation, that the only manestation of our leaders insanity is limited to her elbows. And consider the alternatives - Andrea Im a mother Leadsom, Michael do you like my flesh suit Gove, or Boris woof woof, fruity, I say, what  Johnson.Andrea would have wheeled screaming into the sea  months ago. Gove would have begun trade talks with the lizards from V, and Johnson would have said Bwah, lets just walk awaaaaaaaaaaaaay as he stomped off the White Clfs of Dover onto a bridge that wasnt there and splatted onto the rocks below, taking the British economy with him. Every car manufacturer, farmer, exporter, importer, engineering firm and financial business is terried of the Boris Plan, which is an optimistic name for something all about not having a plan.If Boris was PM, Project Fear would have become reality two years ago. Hed be fine, and the rest of us would be f***ed.  Theresa had the good sense to trigger Article , which would kick the can down the road for two solid years. Two years in which the nation had mild mental depression, rather than a great financial one. Two years in which our economy had uncertainty as opposed to disaster.And for most of it, Theresa gave the job of negotiations to an egotistical idiot incapable of compromise or comprehension. Asking David Davis to extract us from the EU was like asking Edd the Duck to do quadratic equations: destined for failure.Were lucky to have had his ineptitude working in the nations best interests for as long as we did before he flounced off to be inept on the backbenches. Throughout all this Theresa has survived coup attempts, naked politicking, and insubordination. She has actually BENEFITTED from the lack of discipline within her own party, because the plotters are cannibalising each other while shes left to get on with it. And what shes getting on with is nothing whatsoever. That itself is a feat - Prime Ministers are surrounded by advisors, deal-makers, lobbyists, donors, editors, magnates and other nations all pushing her to make decisions. To achieve zero in the face of all the opportunity to do more is simply remarkable. Theresa promised social justice, and failed to manest it. She promised money for the NHS, parity for the mentally ill, schools, jobs, help, funding. Not one of them has appeared, and nor are they likely to. The nation still voted her back in. And we took her lessons to heart - we didnt make much of a decision at all, producing a hung parliament and a deal with the Democratic Ulster Unionists which actually makes the Northern Ireland problem MORE COMPLICATED.By straining ever sinew, Theresa has managed to do nothing at all. For a nation that propelled itself to a clf edge in a highly-emotional state, the fact were still standing on it is almost progress. Yes, prices are up, wages are stagnating, Esther McVeys still a thing and nothing is any better. But it might be worth noting that most things are NOT magnicently worse, and whatever is can be attributed to a hangover from previous years of Tory rule.John Major did not outlast the Eurosceptics. David Cameron did not renegotiate the deal with the EU. Even Margaret Thatcher could not have survived two solid years of blatant leadership manoeuvres.Teflon Theresa has, somehow. Despite Windrush, Grenfell, rising homelessness and a never-ending crisis in AE. Im not arguing shes clever, or shed have figured out the only way out of this mess was to call a general election and ensure one side campaigned for Remain. And Im not arguing shes stupid, or she would have been pressured by civil servants, friends and enemies to do something really bad by now.What Theresa May has by the bucketload is staying power, coupled with a martyr complex which must mean that she enjoys impossible odds, constant undermining, and the mortal danger that extreme stress brings any of us, never mind diabetics.If you voted Leave, you may resent Theresa for not producing it. You should be glad she delayed a disastrous Brexit, and spent two years making it look like your dream of unicorns was deliverable rather than deranged. Andyou voted Remain, you may resent her for insisting on doing a harmful thing that cannot be done properly anyway. You should be glad she gave the country two years to notice it. In a time of immense political turmoil, here and abroad, Theresa has made instability a constant. Weve had two years of no disaster, and all because never before in the field of human endeavour has one person done so little for so long.Everyone who loathes her, put down your politics. Give around of applause for the Prime Minister fighting a one-woman Battle of Britain, and who in doing so has bought us the most important thing of all - time.Now, what are you going to do with it  "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn brands theresa mays","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn brands Theresa Mays Tories too weak and ided to deal with Brexit at PMQsAt PMQs the Prime Minister refused to rule out paying the EU £ billion, evenBritain crashes out without a dealShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video pmqs-corbyn-face-commons-before-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Jeremy Corbyn branded Theresa Mays Tory government too weak and ided to deal with Brexit .And the Prime Minister refused to rule out paying the EU pound billion, evenBritain crashes out without a deal.

Harry Poulson, , from Cornwall, bears an uncanny resemblance to the Duke of Sussex and is earning DOUBLE his previous earnings thanks to the recent Royal pregnancy buzz. He looks so much like the -year-old that he has even been stopped int he street and askedhe is the prince himself. Pictures show Harry surprising passers-by with his strong likeness to Prince Harry and taking selfies with them.  Harry didnt notice the resemblance until he saw a picture of him standing in a field in a combat jacket next to his dog. Harry even shares his name with the prince and currently lives in Dorset and used to work as a carpenter. His royal looks have even prompted strangers to askhe has ever considered working for the royals as Prince Harrys double. Prince Harrys we, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, is now pregnant with the royal couples first child - sparking an increased interest in his doopelganger. I just decided to grow the beard one day to save the effort to be clean shaven, thats what really brought the similarities together and when people really started commenting on out resemblance, he said.  Most people ask meIve ever been told I look like him,Ive ever met him, andthey can have a photo The most common question is about whether Harry is my actual name. Ive had people come up to me and they either do a massive double take, or genuinely askIm him, in which case I usually try to put on a little show for them as a laugh. If they see through it, they normally ask for a selfie just as a laugh. It was first mentioned to me about three years ago, but I couldnt see it at the time, then as more and more people started to say it I slowly started to see similarities. It wasnt until Christmas  when I was snapped by a local paper in Cornwall, with the caption royal spotted at swim I really saw just how similar we looked, and people agreed that we looked similar.  My earning has near enough doubled since Ive started doing this work. Im working flat out these last few weeks as a lookalike, whereas before it was steadier maybe just a job a week, or maybe every other week. I first got signed to an agency just after that Christmas and got my first job in March . I earn enough, that I could do it as a living, but evenit was just a few jobs here and there it can fund my own adventures in le. Im quite happy with it, out of anybody I could look like, Harry is a good one because pretty much everyone loves him, and hes just laid back in le. Harry even had people congratulate him on his engagement before the royal wedding in May, and says the comparison has helped him in business and job interviews.  People have congratulated me on the engagement in May, butone comment stood out it was a few weeks ago when someone askedI had made myself known to the royal guard as a possible body double, he said. I think he is a remarkable man. Hes so down to earth with the common people, and all the work he does for charities in Africa and former service men is inspiring. He has certainly got a very good handle on le and taking up were his mother left off. Id obviously be quite biased by saying hes my favourite royal, but I feelI ever had the chance to meet him wed have more to talk about. He comes across as one of the more laid back and down to earth royals, not that his family isnt but hes always been the cheeky one, which just adds to his personality.  Harry says that he is a fan of the union between the British Prince and American sweetheart, bringing two allied countries together. I think its great! Obviously, theres a long history between the two countries and its nice to see that everyone on both side of the pond is so on board and excited about it, although I think the Americans seem far more enthusiastic about it, he said. When it first started to happen, I was always quite shocked and momentarily speechless, as I couldnt believe people thought we looked similar. Now Ive got used to it I try and just play along with it and have a laugh with it all. I think we both have the same love for being outdoors and doing things, and for being a bit cheeky and mischievous when its possible to get away with it.

But after gazing at the duke, adorable Ruby appeared to prove the feeling wasnt mutual and decided shed had enough. The -month-old was filmed plodding off in the garden as the duke was mid-sentence, but he didnt seem to mind and continued speaking to the tots family. The cheeky encounter came as the royal couple made a pit stop at the Woodley familys farm as part of their royal tour in Dubbo, New South Wales, to learn about the devastating Australian drought.And pregnant Meghan even brought a gt of homemade banana bread. The Woodley family have been farming at Mountain View farm for five generations. Ruby was the star of the show over tea in the garden, where the extended family gathered for a relaxed chat with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. After making a fuss of Ruby, Meghan spoke to the toddler’s mother Emily Carroll, , about her own pregnancy. “They both had a little tickle with her [Ruby],” Mrs Carroll said. “She’s normally in bed at .am but we had to stay up for this. She’s done so well.  “Meghan told me that she’s feeling pretty good so far, which is great, and that she’s running on adrenaline. “She said they’re doing  engagements in  days, with maybe one rest in the middle. “She’s made for this royal business, isn’t she ” She added: “They’re both great with kids.” The family, which gather at the farm for teas and long lunches regularly, were impressed with the Duchess’ gt of banana bread, baked at Admiralty House in Sydney last night.  Benita Woodley, , one of the fth generation of the family on the farm, said: “She saidyou go to someone’s house you always bring something, so she did. “She said she was worried about the bananas, that she’d put too many bananas in it. But the Duke said there’s never too many bananas.” Alice Hall, , proclaimed it five stars, giving it full marks for being moist: the highest accolade for baking in their family. Earlier in the morning, the Woodley sisters had helped round up their cattle for the Duke and Duchess to feed, enticing them with hay on the back of a ute.  The royal couple picked up buckets of cotton seed to pour onto small piles of hay for the cows. The couple spent around five minutes in the field, tipping out food for the cows and watching them. As the left the farm, the heavens opened for the first downpour of rain in three weeks. Kate Woodley said the farm had “barely any rain for seven or eight months”.

Richard Kay, a royal commentator who was close to Diana, revealed how the princess would often talk to her friends of her precious boys - but particularly Harry. Although she adored them both and she and Charles tried to give them equal amounts of love, she reportedly felt that William had been marked from birth for special attention given the fact he will one day be king. Writing for the Daily Mail, Kay revealed how Diana worried about the treatment younger brother Harry got compared to the future heir to the throne. As compensation, Diana poured more love and attention into Harry, he wrote.  He claims she told him I have to. Charles and I worked so hard to ensure both boys receive equal amountsof our time and love, but others in the family seem to concentrate on William. It is not known who the others she is referring to are, but Kay says Diana once told him how she had confronted the Queen Mother over her alleged favouritism.He wrote: One day she told me how matters had come to a head with the Queen Mother. Harry had complained that whenever he and William visited their great-grandmother at Clarence House, it was always William she made a fuss over and who sat next to her. Its not fair, Harry told his mother. Dianas closeness to both of her sons is something she has always been praised and celebrated for. She tried hard to make their upbringing as normal as possible, telling palace staff to only call them by their first names and not prince or your royal highness. A fun-loving mum, she also took them on days out to theme parks and roared with laughter as they got soaked on log flumes. In , on the th anniversary of his beloved mums death, Harry said: She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work, but behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. William has previously spoken about the heartbreak of not having his mother there when he had his own children.  I would like to have had her advice, he said. I would love her to have met Catherine and to have seen the children grow up. It makes me sad that she won’t, that they will never know her. Her brother, Charles Spencer, said on the st anniversary of her death: “One of the great tragedies is that Diana would have been the best grandmother ever.

Talk about great timing. There’s nothing like a royal baby to put everyone – well, most people – in a good mood, evenit is just for a day or two. It gets people talking to each other, something we don’t do enough of these days as we rush about with our busy lives. Inevitably, some commentators have made much of the fact the baby will be the first mixed-race child to have “royal blood”. To hear them speak you’d think they were discussing an episode of Game of Thrones.  In the two years the couple have been together they’ve done so much to reposition the image of monarchy that the idea of a royal baby born with an African-American grandmother doesn’t seem as far-fetched as it would have been years ago. I asked most of my black friends and family what they thought about the announcement. All were excited about the news, even the men. One even declared “the fairlytale continues”. What did they think about the fact the baby will be of mixed race heritage  Not one of them cared. They were more excited about Prince Harry becoming a dad. If May’s royal wedding showed us anything, it was that this is a thoroughly modern couple who embrace all aspects of each other’s backgrounds. Andanyone’s worried about the new arrival being cut off from his or her cultural background, just remember the little one will be doted on by graceful grannie Doria Ragland. If she is able to pass on to her grandchild some of the values she instilled in Meghan when raising her, she’ll have done a great job.

Heavy snowfall is also predicted as the mercury takes a nosee. The Met Office says temperatures are expected to drop by the end of the month as the UK is currently experiencing extremely mild weather with highs of C on Tuesday. But parts of Scotland, northern and central England could be hit with snow before the month is out.  Piers Corbyn, of WeatherAction, told the Express: We are expecting some quite severe snowfall before the end of this month and it will not just be confined to the far north, this could reach parts of the midlands or even further south. This spell of very cold weather looks like bringing substantial snow to a more widespread area of the country than people would necessarily expect at this time of year.  We are also forecasting some very low temperatures, we could see the record for October broken this year. The Met Office says temperatures are expected to drop by the end of the month as the UK is currently experiencing extremely mild weather with highs of C on Tuesday. However, the Met Office believes there is unlikely to be snow in England in October, though there may be overnight frosts.A Met Office spokesperson told Bristol Live : There is, as always at this time of year, a chance there may be some snow over high ground in Scotland and to lower levels in the far north of Scotland.Snow is regularly seen over higher ground in Scotland from September onwards.  However, as far as the chance of snow in [the south of England] in October is concerned for the rest of the month the weather looks fairly typical for the time of year. It is likely to stay generally dry and bright in the south interspersed with spells of more wet and windy weather. Temperatures ying around average, but becoming colder as we go through the month with an increasing risk of overnight frosts and fog. On the whole temperatures are likely to be rather cold, but some brief milder spells are also possible.  WeatherAction, a long-range weather and climate forecasting service, suggests the cold front will bring heavier and longer lasting snow than the Beast from the East earlier in the year. However, the Met Office dismissed the predictions of a freezing four-month period in the UK - or at least that its too early to tell. it said meteorologists can provide detailed weather forecasts for up to seven days and regional forecasts for up to  days, but no further into the future. Three-day UK weather forecastToday: It will be a fine and dry day with sunny spells for most. However, it will be cloudy with patchy light rain in southern and south-western parts of England. Isolated showers are also expected to develop for southern and north-western Scotland. Gentle south-westerly winds, moderate in the north. Tonight: Any remnant rain in southern England will fade away through the course of the night, although some cloud will remain for many southern areas. Skies will be largely clear in the, although there will be more cloud in north-west Scotland. Mist or fog will develop later for Scotland and Northern Ireland. UK Outlook: Tomorrow will be dry and mostly sunny with mist patches during the morning, especially for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Southern areas will be cloudier but will remain dry.

In a move made after Mohammed Bin Salman became Saudi Arabias Crown Prince, the respected journalist relocated to Virginia.There, he penned Washington Post columns and became a prominent critic of Bin Salman, the New York Timesreports.He was engaged to a Turkish woman when he disappeared.Why was he at the Saudi consulate  Mr Khashoggi, a orcee, was caught on CCTV footage arriving at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October . He was visiting the building to obtain marriage documents that would enable him to wed his Turkish fianceacutee. He entered the consulate via its main entrance. His fianceacutee, Hatice Cengiz, who waited outside, said he never re-appeared.  What happened during his visit  There are conflicting claims over what happened at the consulate. Turkish officials have said they believe Mr Khashoggi was murdered and his body removed - an allegation the Saudis have strongly denied. This week, a Turkish source claimed the journalist was cut up alive by a hit squad - who listened to music while dismembering his body. The source, who has allegedly listened to an audio recording of the reporters last moments, said it took seven minutes for him to die.They had come to kill him,” they told Middle East Eye .Mr Khashoggi was allegedly dragged from the Consul General’s office into his study next door, where he was dumped on a table.  Loud screams could then be heard - which only stopped when he was injected with an unknown substance, according to the source. Moments later, his body was allegedly cut up by the squad.According to a report by the NYT , the journalists body is said to have been dismembered with a bone saw brought by the suspects.Saudi officials have denied any involvement in the journalists disappearance, which has made headlines across the world. However, reports have claimed they are preparing a report saying he was killed during an attempt to bundle him out of the consulate. The case has provoked an international outcry against Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter, with more media and business executives pulling out of a planned investment conference there this month.  Are there any suspects  Turkey has identied  suspects in the alleged murder - including forensic evidence expert Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy. The MEE source claimed that Mr Tubaigy listened to music via a set of earphones as he chopped up the reporters body. And he allegedly advised his accomplices to do the same. When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too, Mr Tubaigy said in the audio recording, according to the source. At least nine of the suspects worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries, according to the NYT.  It is alleged they flew out the same day as the killing, and brought the bone saw with them for the purpose of cutting up Mr Khashoggis body. Records allegedly show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi firm arrived and departed from Istanbul on October . The latest claims follow US media reports that Saudi Arabia will admit the vanished journalist died following a botched interrogation. What does Donald Trump say US President Donald Trump earlier sensationally gave Saudi Arabia the benefit of the doubt in Mr Khashoggis disappearance.US lawmakers have pointed the finger at the Saudi leadership, while Western pressure has mounted on Riyadh to provide answers. In an interview with Fox Business Network, Mr Trump saidSaudi Arabia knew what happened in the disappearance, that would be bad. I think we have to find out what happened first, he said yesterday.  Speaking to reporters, he also drew comparisons with the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court scandal, adding: Here we go again with, you know, youre guilty until proven innocent. I dont like that. Mr Trump had earlier posted a Tweet saying that Bin Salman denied knowing what happened in the Saudi consulate. The president has suggested that rogue killers could have been involved in the case. However, such a move without sanction from the Saudi regime is believed to be highly unlikely by many. And how about Turkey  Today, Turkeys foreign minister said the country hoped to enter the Saudi consuls residence in connection with the case. Turkish police had been expected to search the building yesterday. However, they did not do so, officers at the scene said last night, because Saudi officials were not able to join them. Hours earlier, the consul general left Turkey for Riyadh. Yesterday evening, unfortunately, police could not search the Saudi consuls residence, Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters today after meeting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Ankara.  He added: We hope the police will enter to the residence today. We have said before that Saudi Arabia must cooperate with us in every aspect without delay. Mr Cavusoglu, who said the search would extend to the consuls vehicles, said the consul was free to travel home and had not been deported. He also said talks with Mr Pompeo were beneficial and fruitful. Mr Pompeo was on a brief visit to Turkey after having met with the Saudi king, crown prince and foreign minister in Riyadh yesterday. Turkish crime scene investigators had carried out a nine-hour search of the consulate on Monday night as part of the probe. Last Saturday, a Turkish newspaper reported that recordings made on Mr Khashoggis Apple Watch - had been uncovered by investigators.  These recordings allegedly indicated he was tortured and killed, but the report in the Sabah daily could not immediately be veried. “The moments when Khashoggi was interrogated, tortured and murdered were recorded in the Apple Watch’s memory,” the paper said. It added that the watch had synched with the journalists iPhone, which his fiancee was carrying outside the consulate. However, technology experts have said it is highly unlikely the watch could have recorded actions inside the embassy and uploaded them to an iCloud account. And the Saudis  Saudi officials have denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggis disappearance and have claimed he left the consulate safely. After meeting with King Salman and the crown prince yesterday, Mr Pompeo told reporters that Saudi Arabia has committed to conducting a complete investigation into the case. In each of those meetings I stressed the importance of them conducting a complete investigation into the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, he told reporters.  They made a commitment to do that. He added: They said it would be a thorough, complete and transparent investigation. They indicated they understood that getting that done in a timely, rapid fashion so they could begin to answer important questions. Asked whether they said Mr Khashoggi was alive or dead, Mr Pompeo said: They didnt talk about any of the facts. Last Thursday, Turkey said it and Saudi Arabia had agreed to form a joint working group - at Riyadh’s initiative - to investigate the case. A Saudi source said a senior royal, Prince Khaled al-Faisal, had visited Turkey that day.  And the following day, SPA said that Saudi Arabia’s interior minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Na, condemned the “lies and baseless allegations” against the kingdom. However, he apparently praised the joint investigation with Turkey. Has the UK issued a statement  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and his G counterparts have said they are very troubled by Mr Khashoggis disappearance. They have insisted those responsible must be held to account. In an earlier statement, the G foreign ministers said: We, the G foreign ministers, of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, affirm our commitment to defending freedom of expression and protection of a free press.  We remain very troubled by the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Those bearing responsibility for his disappearance must be held to account. We encourage Turkish-Saudi collaboration and look forward to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia conducting a thorough, credible, transparent, and prompt investigation, as announced. Mr Hunt has said previously that questions remain about the case that only Saudi Arabia can answer. On Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman said Britain expected the Saudi government to provide a detailed response to questions over Mr Khashoggis disappearance. “We expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response,” the spokesman told reporters.  What do Mr Khashoggis relatives say  In a heartbreaking statement released on Monday, members of Mr Khashoggis family called for an investigation. We are sadly and anxiously following the conflicting news regarding the fate of our father after losing contact with him two weeks ago, they said. The strong moral and legal responsibility which our father instilled in us obliges us to call for the establishment of an independent and impartial international commission to inquire into the circumstances of his death.

I thought it was a good performance, especially in the first half.“It didn’t feel like a - defeat, so it was a bit disappointing coming off with that scoreline but it was good to get the goal at the end.”The former Partick Thistle and Wigan centre-half has been pleased with his own progress in the blue of Scotland lately after picking up his third cap.He hopes that, alongside defensive partner McKenna, there are many more to come in the months and years ahead as Alex McLeish’s side look to get their Nations League campaign back on track as they travel to Albania and Israel come to Hampden next month.“In my first two caps I think I played very well and again last night, apart from near the end where I gave the ball away and it led to a goal, I thought I had a solid performance.“I’m taking everything in my stride, trying to keep learning and, hopefully, building on it. Scott’s a talented player and it’s good to see that kind of talent coming through the Scotland ranks.

For the first time in a while, there was a spark and energy about the team that suggests they have the quality to mount a strong and successful promotion challenge.Having suggested that, through no fault of Neilson or his players, this was maybe not the best game on which to judge them.While United’s play for most of the proceedings was excellent, there is no doubt in Thistle they were facing a beleaguered outfit that looks to still be coming to terms with a relegation.Two games against the Tangerines this season have seen them well-beaten and fortunate the margin of their defeats were not considerably greater. They are in the process of finding a new manager to replace Alan Archibald and it’s clear the man who comes in has a very big job on his hands.As the old adage goes, however, Neilson and his players could only beat what was put in front of them and in his first game in charge victory was achieved in some style.And aspects of the performance mean Arabs do have good reason to feel optimistic about their team’s prospects.After just a few days working with the new boss, Saturday saw a United team that looked reinvigorated and one that, apparently, had a clear idea of what the game plan was. Too often that was not the case under his predecessor Laszlo.That produced a top performance and fine inidual displays, not least from man-of-the-match Paul McMullan.Less than two months ago it appeared his time at Tannadice could be up. On the evidence of his display at Thistle, the former Scotland U  could now be ready to show why McKinnon battled so hard to get him.Andthe work he, and others, did on the ball gave plenty of reason to look forward to the games that lie ahead, so too did the ferocious way the entire team battled to get it back when Partick had possession.Particularly under Laszlo, opposing teams were given too much time in possession, but now United look like a side that will get the ball back quickly.It’s why, while not getting ahead of themselves, United fans can again feel hopeful about their team."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bc5a6f55ef3c.jpg ","title":"undertakers move into royal bank of scotland building in dundee","story":"One of Dundee’s longest-established funeral directors is to take over the former RBS building in Stobswell.Grant Speedie, of James Ashton and Son on Cardean Street, confirmed that the firm will extend its business into the former bank building on Albert Street, which is just round the corner from the current premises.Mr Speedie said: “We can confirm that we have bought the former RBS building on Albert Street.“We get the keys on Thursday.“We will then go through the planning process with a view to beginning renovation work on the building next spring and would then hope to be in a position to open for business in summer.”Mr Speedie said that as part of its long-term plans for the former bank building, the firm had agreed with RBS that the cash machine located there would remain open for customers.He added: “We are delighted to be taking over this building to expand the service we can offer to our customers.“We are a long-established firm of funeral directors in Dundee and keen to stay in the Stobswell area.“We are happy to be part of the regeneration of Stobswell and hopeful that this move will also bring extra jobs to the local community.“We have agreed with RBS that we are happy to retain the ATM at the building and believe this is an important local facility for the community of Stobswell.“We have agreed that it will initially be retained for five years.”Colin Clement, chairman of Stobswell Community Forum, said he was happy to hear that Ashtons had agreed to retain the ATM at the building.“We fought to retain the bank but, when that didn’t happen, we sought an assurance that the ATM would be kept,” he said.“It has been out of order recently but I am delighted to hear it will be retained when Ashtons move into the building.”Local newsagent Anil Tewari said: “It is important that this ATM is retained.

But you have to listen to anything he says because he has been there and done it at World Cups and Champions League finals.“If he says something, I really pick up on it because I want to learn from him.”Aberdeen secured Lowe on a loan deal until January  from the Championship Rams the day before the summer transfer window closed.The -year-old had started the first two Championship games of the season for Derby only to fall down to third-choice left-back.However, such was Lampard’s faith in the defender, he signed him on a three-year contract extension  hours before he moved north to Pittodrie.Lowe remains in regular contact with Lampard and assistant Jody Morris, who also played for Cha.The Reds defender said: “The gaffer has been great with me since he came in during pre-season.“He has shown me the things I can do to improve and Jody is always on the phone to me as well.“I will text him after the game to let him know how I did and also to see how Derby did.“They get clips sent to them and Jody will tell me what I should and shouldn’t do defensively.“I take it all on board as they have both played at a high level and Jody has played in the Scottish league himself.

He’ll have a good career and we’re grateful to have him.“Especially when at times we know the importance of Shinnie in the middle of the park.“Andyhas been a very strong left-back for me over the last few years.“There will be times when Andy is the better option to play there but against St Mirren, Max was the right one to play left-back.”Lowe recently indicated he would be happy to extend his loan spell beyond January until the end of the season.For McInnes that would have been the ideal scenario but admits it is too early into the loan spell to commit to that.When askedLowe’s loan could be extended, McInnes said: “The answer is I don’t know.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it.

Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal.

Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April . That’s what we are aiming for. “Between the property and the cost of the fit, we are talking about an investment or three-quarters of a million pounds, so it is a big project for us. “This is the furthest north we have been and we are looking at employing around - local people.” The Blue Lagoon already has both takeaways and restaurants in Glasgow, as well as in places like Ayr, Largs and Stirling. The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent.

Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

In our view, putting this substation on the foreshore will detract from the possibility to fully develop the site.The Reporter will now consider they representations before making a decision on the next stage of her investigation.Local ward Councillor Lachlan Bruce praised the community council representatives for their presentations to the Reporter.He added: ldquoI was very disappointed by the applicantrsquos dismissive views on what has been suggested for by the local communities for the site.ldquoLots of ideas have been put forward that would create jobs and opportunities on the site and they should be given all due considerations and not just knocked to the wayside so that they can build their big shed that will create no real employment opportunities for the local area.ldquoIrsquom still confident that the Reporter will find that this isnrsquot the best location of substation at Cockenzie and I can only hope that Scottish Government Ministers will make the best decision for the people of East Lothian which is for rejection of this application, I have my doubts that they will."},{"url":null,"title":"cardboard-cops-could-be-used-to-halt-speeding-drivers","story":"The unusual tactic would involve placing a le-sized version of a police officer, holding a pro-laser speed gun, at the side of the road.A mph vehicle speed limit was recently introduced throughout most of Dunbar and it has been suggested that cut-out police officers could be deployed to encourage motorists to slow down.The issue was discussed at the townrsquos community and police partnershipmeeting.Pippa Swan, from the townrsquos community council, was among those who felt that the idea ndash put forward by PC Gavin Ross ndash had merit.She said: ldquoI personally think that any suggestion our community police officers make has got to be taken very seriously.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough. The community canrsquot take it any longer.David Forrest, TECC chairman, shared these concerns, pointing out the lack of infrastructure as the main reason for objecting to the plans.He said: ldquoGrounds for an objection has to be that the infrastructure in Tranent couldnrsquot cope with another  houses on the south side of Tranent.ldquoAll that traffic would be travelling through the centre, whether itrsquos to get to Edinburgh or just to go shopping.ldquoTranent is unique, traffic-wise, in East Lothian.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.John PrebbleIn Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present.

Indeed, I would argue that no self-respecting Parliament would fall for it, she declared.In a speech to the Royal Society of Arts, the social change think-tank, in London, Ms Sturgeon complained that the Conservative Government had shown ldquolittle inclination to pay heed to Scotland during the Brexit process.ldquoOne of the lessons from our experience of the last two years, which I suspect has not been lost on the Scottish people and which will be remembered in Scotland for a long time to come, is the stark contrast between the EUrsquos treatment of independent nations and the UKrsquos treatment of devolved nations.Claiming the UK had ldquodismissed and ignored Scotlandrsquos concerns, the FM noted: ldquoLooking at the UK and the EU, it is fair to say that only one has looked like a genuine partnership of equals and that has not been the UK.Ms Sturgeon stressed how her Government had made a ldquobig compromise by dropping its demand that Scotland remain in the EU and pledged it to exhausting all the ldquoopportunities for compromise, holding out hope that a sensible outcome could be achieved. However, she made clear Scotland staying in the customs union and single market was Edinburghrsquos ldquobottom line.She pointed out thatthere were a special carve-out on the single market for Northern Ireland, then Scotland should be next in line for a ldquodferentiated approach.The FM only fleetingly mentioned the option of a second independence referendum, saying howno compromise could be reached, then Scotland ldquomust have the option to choose a dferent course ie independence.In a question and answer session following her speech, she claimed the ldquocase for democratic independence since  has strengthened immeasurably, noting how in the referendum campaign it was argued a Yes vote would result in Scotland leaving the EU.ldquoThat brings into sharp focus the democratic deficit Scotland has experienced on many occasions, which on this issue it has felt particularly harshly, she said.The Nationalist leader dismissed the Prime Ministerrsquos compromise blueprint as ldquoimpracticable, undesirable and undeliverable, stressing that whatever proposalMPs might finally vote on, it would not be the Chequers Plan.She noted how the EU was bitterly opposed to Chequers becauseit would undermine the unity of the single market, dealing only with goods and not services. Plus, there was no Westminstermajority for it.Ms Sturgeon rebuffed Mrs Mayrsquos claim that it was the only option on the table this was so, the FM pointed out, because the PM refused to countenance any other.ldquoLetrsquos be clear, she declared, ldquoa head-in-the-sand approach wonrsquot make the Chequers ostrich fly.The SNP leaderinsisted that neither a fudged Brexit deal not a ldquoblindfold Brexit ie a vague political statement of intent about the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU, would do. A blindfold Brexit would ldquoreplace a no-deal Brexit with a no-detail Brexit, she said.ldquoVoting against a bad or a blindfold Brexit deal isnrsquot a vote for no-deal it would be a vote for a better deal, insisted Ms Sturgeon.The FM accused the Conservative Government of taking an ldquoextreme interpretation of the  referendum result, which, she argued, was not a mandate for a hard Brexit and that the ldquoobvious democratic compromise was for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union.Indeed, Ms Sturgeon went on to say that her preferred option ldquomight well be the only option which is not completely impossible.She explained: ldquoIt should be acceptable to the EU. It avoids the worst economic damage that Brexit will wreak. It resolves the Irish border issue and it comes closest to reconciling the dfering views of Leavers and Remainers. And while it is an outcome, which still looks some distance away, it is not unachievable.The FM called for a genuine attempt to find common ground, stressing how the Scottish Government had shown its willingness to compromise, ldquoit is time the UK Government did likewise.In response, aspokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \"We will have an ambitious course outside of the EU that enhances our prosperity and security and that genuinely works for everyone across the UK.\"We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU and look forward to continuing to engage with the EU Commission on our proposals.\"Adam Tomkins, theScottish Conservative Constitution spokesman,said there was \"nothing new\" in Ms Sturgeons speech, which had been made \"in the hope of drumming up the prospects for Scottish independence\".He added: \"If the SNP doesnt back a deal, it is automatically supporting a no-deal scenariosomething the Nationalists have admitted would be bad for Scotland.\"And, of course, they dont careoutcomes are bad for Scotland, so long as theyre good for the prospects of another independence referendum.\"Labours Ian Murray, who co-chairs Scottish Labour for the Single Market, said:ldquoThere is no such thing as a good Brexitand the First Minister is right to state that UK membership of the single market and the customs union is the least-worst option for our economy.ldquoGiven the problems with solving the border issue in Ireland, this is the only practical solution.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-power-to-use-100-wind-power-after-selling-off-last-coal-and-gas-stations","story":"The Spanish-owned giant has become the first major UK energy supplier to refocus entirely on renewable sources such as wind and solar.Its move comes a week after the International Panel on Climate Changewarned the world was \"off track\" in efforts to limit environmentally catastrophic global warming.IPCC scientists warned \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\" were required.Scottish Power on Tuesday said it had sold its remaining conventional electricity generation business to a subsidiary of Drax Group for poundm.And it said it would invest pound.bn in UK to more than double existing  gigawatt capacity for renewable energy over the next four years.Ignacio Galaacuten, Chairman and Chief Executive of Iberdrola, Scottish Powers parent, said: \"Energy companies must be part of the solution to climate change.\"Iberdrola is acting now to cut carbon emissions  per cent by  and be carbon neutral by .

Grown-ups can defend themselves, or walk away. A partnership or marriage can end, but childhood lasts forever. Unless parental force is so extreme that the authorities have to step in, young children cannot escape their punishers. They simply have to grow wary, and hope it doesnrsquot happen again.Proposals to outlaw smacking, to be brought before Holyrood in a memberrsquos bill by Green MSP John Finnie, might become law within the year. It will be a historic day, a signal that we are among the most civilised of nations, committed to caring for those who canrsquot protect themselves.When you look at the levels of anger and violence in our own society, let alone the world, this change of culture canrsquot come soon enough. Yet the prospect of the ban has caused protests. Less than a thirdof respondents to a survey support it, and more than halfbelieve smacking should still be allowed.Their main worry, it seems, is not the welfare of children but the potential for so-called respectable adults to be criminalised for raising their offspring as they see fit. For some, as for their own parents and countless generations before them, teaching right from wrong involves tough love. How  can a toddler be prevented from running into the road  Surely a short, sharp lesson will make the point and potentially save their lives Well, perhaps. But to judge by the number of times Irsquove watched little ones yanked by the arm, thumped on the bottom or the back of the legs and even on one occasion slapped hard on the face ndash all without modying their behaviour ndash it would seem the message isnrsquot getting through. Pain and humiliation do not result in obedience and docility. When used too often, or fiercely, smacking causes resentment, rebellion and fear. A woman thwacking her spaniel to bring it to heel would be universally viewed with horror. Some might even dare to remonstrate. But when itrsquos a child, we are schooled to walk on, since itrsquos none of our business.In previous ages, when people were less educated, families large and money tight, physical punishment was deemed perfectly acceptable. Now, however, it looks uncomfortably like brutality. Since time immemorial the British attitude to children has been punitive, telling them to keep quiet, and allowing them to become the butt of unfeeling or sadistic schoolteachers as well as parents. Yet a teacher today who clipped a pupil over the ear or brought a ruler down on the back of their hands would be queuing up at the JobCentre before nightfall. Such acts were outlawed decades ago. By introducing a smacking ban, government will thus be calling time on the harsh treatment inflicted on children at home, where privacy no longer hides them from the reach of the law.Most parents will admit that smacking is not a sign that they are in charge, but that they have lost control. The signal it sends to youngsters is that aggression is a normal response to a situation. To the old argument that ldquoit never did me any harm, take a look at the levels of depression, addiction and anxiety around us. Coming under physical attack from the people who love you most is deeply and sometimes permanently scarring. It can lead to self-harming, to abusive relationships in adulthood and, since they have experienced it from infancy, to lashing out when under duress.Itrsquos half a century since Bob Dylan wrote his prophetic song in which he tells mothers and fathers: ldquoYour sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly aginrsquo. Please get out of the new one If you canrsquot lend your hand  For the times they are a-changinrsquo.They are indeed changing, and for the better. Rethinking how to educate and control children requires time, effort, and bottomless reserves of patience and self-restraint. It involves talking to youngsters, and reasoning with them, once they are old enough to understand, and drawing lines beyond which there will be consequences ndash but none of them violent.I know several young mums with demanding families, one with four boys below eight. She and her husband have acquired the sort of negotiating skills that could win us a brilliant Brexit deal. Explaining, being firm but kind, finding distractions, and never losing it are the new rules. Indeed,countries and international diplomacy were run on the same principles the world, like our children, would be in a better and happier place."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-ministers-set-to-crack-down-on-private-parking-firms","story":"Ministers want to cap penalties at the standard rate charged by councils and introduce a new independent appeals system to deal with disputes.It comes amid widespread concerns that motorists are being ripped off by unscrupulous parking firms ndash and given little option to complain.It is understood the Scottish Government will introduce tighter restrictions as part of its Transport Scotland Bill, due to come before Holyrood early next year.Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who has been pushing for a change in the law, said he has agreed to halt his own Private Memberrsquos Bill after officials assured him it would be covered in the upcoming legislation.He said: ldquoCleaning up the rules, creating unorm conditions, maximum penalties and an independent appeals service has the support of the Scottish Government.

Sands helpline operates from .am to .pm Monday to Friday and pm to pm Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Sands is leading a coalition of more than  charities working to prevent baby deaths and pregnancy loss. Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie makes most beautiful shortlist","story":"Inverurie has been shortlisted for Scotland#s Most Beautul High Street competition run by Scotland#s Towns Partnership , Keep Scotland Beautul, and the Herald on Sunday.The STP seeks to celebrate towns, cities and villages that take pride in where they live, and highlight the groups who come together and work to change their communities for the better: making local places clean, attractive, accessible, sustainable, vibrant and inclusive for all to enjoy.Entries will be judged on factors including horticultural achievement, public realm, environmental responsibility, community participation and accessibility and inclusivity.Inverurie Environmental ImprovementGroup chairman, John Glover, said: “IEI is delighted that Inverurie Town Centre has been shortlisted for Scotland’s Most Beautul High Street.\"The Town Centre has looked exceptionally well with the floral displays this year.

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting.

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said she is delighted to see it being implemented so swtly.She said: \"By encouraging people to top up from the tap using refillable bottles, we will help cut down on our use of plastics and promote the benefits of hydration building on Scottish Waters Your Water, Your Le campaign.\"I now look forward to refilling my bottle at the Top Up Tap outside the parliament in the coming months.\"The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers.Water samples will be tested every two minutes, on average, to ensure that quality is maintained.Licensed premises are legally bound to serve tap water on request, yet research shows Scots are uncomfortable asking, something this campaign hopes to change. Customer research by Scottish Water revealed tap is the water of choice for almost two thirds of people in Scotland , and currently over a thirdcarry reusable bottles always or often when out and about. But less than a thirdsaid theyd be happy to go into a cafeacute and ask for their bottle to be filled.On average a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save pound. a day, nearly pound a year.The Top Up Taps are made from marine-grade steel and are connected to the mains water supply.* For further information visit www.yourwateryourleWednesday  Oct  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amA programme of events in Orkney to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War has been announced.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But the work is very intensive and requires the repeated closure of the vital road link multiple times every day.A road-rail ersion onto the neighbouring railway tracks has been created to allow key through-access for cars but this can only operate during gaps in rail services ndash causing serious disruption to drivers who miss those windows. At peak times the queues waiting for a window can stretch back  cars in each direction.Highland Council has now given an update on the worksrsquo progress, and urged the public to plan their journeys carefully to avoid missing one of the windows when the ersion is operating.Cllr Allan Henderson, the chairman of the councilrsquos environment, development and infrastructure committee, said: \"We have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road rail ersion is in place but inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits so we urge people to plan their travel carefully.\"Questions and answers about the works have also been published online following public meetings. They are available at www.highland.gov.ukMeanwhile, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP, Kate Forbes, has called for train services between Strathcarron and Kyle to be suspended during the works to reduce the disruption. She said bus replacement services would have less of an impact than the road closures.She said: \"Itrsquos been well documented that the current convoy system is having a hugely detrimental impact on pupils attending Plockton High School as well as local businesses.\"The situation is far from ideal. I believe a better solution is that ScotRail and Network Rail should terminate all trains at Strathcarron and for a bus replacement service to operate and call at all stations between Strathcarron and Kyle.

If theyrsquore going to be building more houses we need more shops.\"The celebrated land deal cost pound,.The council said this was funded through grants from the Scottish Government.A spokeswoman said no decision had been taken as to the timescale for development or of the mix of tenure for the land, which is identied within the Inner Moray Firth Development Plan as having capacity for  homes,She said it is likely that the development will include housing for mid-market rent and shared equity as well as housing for social rent by the council or Albyn Housing Society.Ms Mitchell, who has been running Sharonrsquos Unisex Hair Studio on King Street for more than  years, said the council should make the homes available for purchase under a LIFT Scheme, known otherwise as a Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers.Under this shared equity scheme, of which there are two dferent models, the Scottish Government is this year providing pound million to help people buy a home, within certain price thresholds, for sale on the open market. It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best. The majority of my younger clients are saying theyrsquore still staying at home with their mums and dads and trying to save and getting nowhere.\"Or a few friends have clubbed together and are renting a place because they canrsquot afford to live on their own.\"Cllr Smith, who has been campaigning for new homes for Invergordon, is overjoyed with the move.She said people want to live and rent social housing in Invergordon, but some also want to buy privately.\"To this end I managed to include two new housing sites in the Inner Moray Firth Local Plan a few years ago. These were the northern end of the Cromlet site, opposite the rugby club and the farmland at Davidson Drive, surrounding the farm buildings.\"Both landowners were approached and the latter is under discussion.\"She added: \"Invergordon has so much to offer in terms of employment, both atthe base and industrial estates, as well as the cruise sector, which is growing, but people need a decent roof over their heads.\"By encouraging inward-migration and moving around within the town we also encourage the economics to grow, so more people means more people in the town shopping and more new shopping ideas popping up as there would be people to use them.\"In latter years, Invergordonrsquos population has settled around the  mark, whereas Alness has grown to just over .\"It is time this balanced-out and allowed both towns to be more equal in terms of shopping experiences.\"Wednesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

And they, he added, are “simply unwilling to have more turbines foisted upon them”.So they will doubtless be dismayed by the news that Scottish Power has sold off its gas and hydro plants to concentrate on wind and renewables, with plans to more than double the capacity of windfarms currently generating electricity or under construction. However, for others, it is a sign of things to come, a move that heralds a new age as the world moves towards a zero-carbon future that will enable us to avoid dangerous climate change and bring a literal breath of fresh air to blow away potentially deadly pollution.These two groups may seem implacably opposed to one another, but in reality they both make valid points. Scotland is famous all over the world for the romantic beauty of its landscape, a fact that helps encourage millions of tourists to come here. Allowing the industrialisation of the Highlands would be a scandal. But, fortunately, that does not need to happen. Scotland has vast amounts of wind energy and it is possible to site onshore windfarms in places where they do not desecrate the countryside. : Scottish Power becomes first big UK energy firm to switch to % wind powerAnd the most consistent supply of wind is found out to sea, particularly on the west coast, as anyone who has visited the Outer Hebrides can attest. The UK Government has been criticised for failing to encourage onshore windfarms – not least because they are a source of increasingly cheap electricity. However, part of Westminster’s strategy has been to encourage offshore wind in the hope that the UK – and particularly Scotland – can create a globally signicant industry. As UK Energy Minister Claire Perry pointed out in The Scotsman yesterday, the transition to renewable energy is a challenge but also “one of the greatest industrial opportunities of our time”. So Scotland can help the world fight climate change and make money in the process.And it is the latter reason that is perhaps the most important driving force, as Scottish Power’s chief executive Keith Anderson suggested when he said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.” The firm has become the first of the ‘Big Six’ to ditch fossil fuels but simple economics means it is unlikely to be the last,: UK Energy Minister: Scotland has a chance of a letime on green energy©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4815926.1539759412!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots are driven to starvation due to universal credit claims says snp minister","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Vulnerable people across the country are being driven to starvation as a result of Universal Credit according to an SNP minister. Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville called for the UK Government to halt proceedings and address some of the major problems following the rollout of Universal Credit.Speaking at Glasgow City Council’s Universal Credit hub in Ibrox, she told the Daily Record: “As a constituency MSP and on ministerial visits, I have heard of cases that are simply heartbreaking. “I have had case studies put to me of people who only eat on a Tuesday and a Thursday because they have no money coming into the house.“When I visited the Citizens Advice Bureau, I saw that they put ‘starvation’ in the case study notes for someone.“In this day and age in Scotland, we are talking about that because of a choice that’s being made by this Westminster Government on how to run a benefits system.”She also stated that many councils were trying their best to combat the problem and praise Glasgow City Council for their hub saying: “The council and Scottish Government can’t stop these roll-outs from happening. But what they are able to provide is inidualised support for people to access a system that is inherently designed to make it as complicated as possible and to create as many barriers as possible.“Services like these can break down these barriers.“It’s great the council are doing that for them but it’s a shame it’s required in the first place.”New claimants at the Govan jobcentre were the first in Glasgow to switch to Universal Credit on September  – with more than , others in the city set to follow between now and early December.Following the roll-outs in other parts of the UK, many have suffered with food bank use and rent arrears rising.Labour is to attempt to force the Government to publish its analysis of the impact of Universal Credit on people’s incomes.The party will use an opposition day debate in the Commons on Wednesday to try to secure the release of the assessment drawn up by officials.Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said they would use the same procedural device they adopted last year to obtain the release of the Government’s Brexit impact assessment papers.Yesterday, the Church of England joined calls for reform of Universal Credit, saying fallout from the new benefit system is being seen at its food banks across the country.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical.Ian,I assume you mean “s of tonnes of concrete” per turbine base  Given that a single, typical .MW turbine needs over a thousand tonnes of steel-reinforced concrete , then VE turbines, whose blades will sweep  times the area , at . times the height, must surely need bases several times bigger than that # perhaps, - tonnes, each The accompanying destruction of the land these machines are sited on is also alarming # here is a quote from the link, again, for the small, .MW machine: Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed.

The box is closed.#It doesn’t exist, whether that be in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney. Shetland is now in the right place. It is ridiculous that I had to change the law to make this happen but so be it.#This Islands Act must go a whole lot further.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8671926.1539771380!/image/image.jpg","title":"chinese delegation on trade visit to borough","story":"A Chinese delegation visited Mid and East Antrim this week for a key meeting focused on strengthening business links and increasing trade between both areas.Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar, hosted visitors including Mr Xinsheng Zhao, Jacques, Director of the China Jiangsu Provincial Economic and Trade Office in the UK Mr Gao Meeng, Mayor, Chief of the people’s government of Donghai County and Mr Li Feng, Secretary of the Party Working Committee of Donghai Economic Development Zone.Jiangsu is one of the leading provinces in China in terms of finance, education, technology and tourism while Donghai County is among the top  economic counties in China and one of the most attractive potential investment areas in China.Mayor Lindsay Millar said: “I was delighted to welcome the delegation to Mid and East Antrim and the meeting proved extremely beneficial for both parties, ending with the signing of a friendship agreement between both areas.“Our key strategic priority is growing the economy – with China identied as a vital partner to those investment plans, and closer ties offering huge potential for mutually beneficial business links through jobs and prosperity both here and in China.”Councillor Audrey Wales MBE said: “We in Mid and East Antrim are committed to doing all that we can to build relationships with China and harness a relationship aimed at boosting practical and mutual benefits.“We are capitalising on all opportunities to develop relationships with global businesses leaders and raise our profile as an attractive investment location.”She added: “Crucial to those plans is Amply, our economic strategy for Mid and East Antrim, which we launched earlier this year and is aimed at promoting the development of our borough right through until .“Greater collaboration with our Chinese partners is crucial to delivering on our vision.”Chief Executive Anne Donaghy said: “We are blessed with an abundance of talent in Mid and East Antrim, and it is vital we work together to harness those skills and potential to successfully grow the local economy.“We are keen to build and develop a relationship with China to foster partnership with regions and organisation in order to identy opportunities to increase trade and economic activity promote Foreign Direct Investment increase tourism encourage strategic investment in infrastructure promote and generate investment in Mid and East Antrim and establish cultural links.“We have a number of local companies with existing links to China.

Angela and John with some of the trophies Angela Jeffers, , a technology and design technician at Hazelwood Integrated College, and her husband John, , operations trainer at Belfast International Airport, started as casual dancers but in the past few years have stepped up to competition level.This summer they were the sole representatives from NI to take part in the Dance Promoters Association’s showpiece in Bournemouth where they were crowned Closed UK Champions in the Over  Beginners category. They also picked up third place in the Over s Novice bracket.Angela, who is originally from Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, said: “We’re both kept very busy with our jobs but we’ve our weekends free to devote to dancing. We fly over to Liverpool on a Friday night for a lesson for two hours, have a competition on the Sunday and then fly home on Monday morning and go straight back into work.”Along with her husband John who comes from Crumlin, they have picked up an impressive haul of trophies with the prizes they received at the Bournemouth Summer Festival taking pride of place.   Angela and John Jeffers in action “We were up against so many good dancers,” said Angela. “We were astounded to finish with a first and a third place.”She added: “We started dancing lessons just after we got married, so that’s about  years ago, but the competitions we’ve been doing for less than three years.“It never even occurred to us to take lessons before we got married for the first dance. We got married in a very small castle hotel near Edinburgh. We didn’t have a disco anyway, we had a magician instead.”Askedthe dance competitions the pair took part in looked in any way like Strictly Come Dancing, Angela said: “I always worry that all people see of dancing is Strictly. That’s more like show dancing.    Angela and John Jeffers “Competition dancing is not like Strictly whatsover. Our routines are based on trying to get the footwork correct, the timing, the posture.“People think they’re going to see us throwing each other around over our heads. What we do is proper dancing.“For example, to go through the steps of the foxtrot is not dficult, it’s making it look like a foxtrot that is the skill. If someone is dancing and you’re watching them through a window, would you know what dance they are doing  Most times it just looks like they’re walking around the room.”Police investigating link between Ballymena break-ins Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"She added: “In Strictly when you see the smoke on the floor, they’re hiding their feet. The amount of time they spend out of hold, floating about wasting time, that wouldn’t happen in a proper competition.   John and Angela dressed for their appearance in Lost City of Z “I think people who watch Strictly will end up having an unrealistic expectation about dancing. They think you can learn to dance in a week. If we all had a professional training us for  hours a day maybe we could.“It takes a lot longer when you’re only doing one lesson a week which is closer to the norm because of time and money. We go three times a week, maybe spend about five or six hours practising, but that’s because we’re in competitions.”Detailing how they began dancing, Angela said: “It was something that I always wanted to do. We saw this advertisement in a shop in Randalstown for Bob Lindsay’s social dancing class.“My husband started as a reluctant dancer, he really only did it for me. Although he does enjoy it a lot more now.”The pair moved on to Clarke’s Dance Studios in Belfast before getting tuition from Paul Taylor, a professional dancer from Liverpool.Angela said: “I remember being a bag of nerves before our first competition in England. But as we stepped up our lessons our technique, footwork and timing improved. As we did more competitions we started getting a few firsts.“Sadly there aren’t really any competitions in Northern Ireland so mostly we go to England or down to Ireland.“You don’t really do it for the prizes, it’s for personal achievement. We’re all in it together. You get quite friendly with the people you’re dancing against.

Mr Casey was raised in Derry and attended Nazareth House Primary School and St Columbs College. He is the CEO and Chairman hf global recruitment firm Claddagh Resources. History was made last year when the Dáil gave formal recognition to Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within the State.However, Mr Casey said: \"Thats a load of nonsense. They are not from Romany or whatever.\"When challenged about his views, Mr Casey doubled down, saying the arrival of Travellers in an area \"devastates the prices of the houses\".\"Lets call a spade a spade. Your house price doesnt start going through the roof as soon as you get two dozen Travellers moving in down the street from you,\" he said.He cited an ongoing dispute in Tipperary where six homes are empty in a €.m development because families living on an unauthorised site nearby want stables for horses.\"Im sorry, theres something seriously wrong with society when were at that stage,\" Mr Casey said.His comments were last night described by Pavee Point as \"ill-informed, grossly insulting and offensive\".David Joyce, a member of the Travelling community and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, told the Irish Independent: \"He should withdraw from the campaign. Hes shown hes not fit to represent all the people of Ireland. This man is a racist. He is scapegoating my community.\"Mr Joyce, who is also a solicitor, added: \"I dont think any presidential campaign in the past has ever stooped to this level of blatant racism.\"He said the candidates views were \"founded on ignorance, prejudice and pure racism\".\"The notion that we all live in caravans and pull up on peoples land is rubbish,\" he said.Martin Collins, co-director of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, said: \"These comments put his presidential campaign on the same level as a local election where people play the nimby card to gain votes, as we have seen so often in the past.Martin Collins, co-director of Pavee Point Traveller and Roma Centre, has criticised the comments. \"This potentially can feed into racist stereotypes and it is reckless and irresponsible and certainly not befitting anyone standing to be president for all the people of Ireland.\"Mr Collins said Mr Caseys input had helped to \"belittle the lived experience of Travellers in terms of racism and exclusion\".The interview was described as \"very concerning\" by Shane OCurry, director of the European Network Against Racism, which has  member organisations in Ireland.\"I am shocked at the ignorance of his comments. They show that Peter Casey is as ignorant as he is inept at politicking,\" he said.\"His comments about Traveller ethnicity fly in the face of academic consensus and what Travellers say themselves.\"It betrays a gross misunderstanding of what it is to be an ethnic minority, as well as a gross misunderstanding of what le is like in Ireland for ethnic minorities.\"The purpose of recognising Traveller ethnicity is to renegotiate the relationship between society and Travellers so that we can value Travellers contribution to society more.\"Peter Caseys comments have a devastating effect.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy.

Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said.

Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A referendum on the issue takes place on October .“We recognise that there is grave concern at the way blasphemy laws have been used to justy violence and oppression against minorities in other parts of the world,” he said.However, the human right of faith communities to contribute to public debate on issues of importance without being subjected to attack or ridicule “must be acknowledged and respected” he said.The church would have preferred to have seen a proposal to replace the blasphemy section of the constitution “with an article protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech in accordance with the European Convention on Human Rights” he added.Part of Article .. in the southern constitution states: “The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.” It rose to prominence last year when a complaint was made over Mr Fry making critical comments about God during an interview on RTE, leading to a criminal investigation. No prosecution was brought.Gay Byrne asked what Mr Fry would say to Godhe died and had to confront him. In his imaginary conversation with God, Fry said he would tell Him: “How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault  It’s not right. “It’s utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain ” Five years ago  churches, including the Catholic Church, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church, endorsed a submission to government on the issue which said “the current reference to blasphemy in the Constitution of Ireland is largely obsolete”.RHI Inquiry: Burning oats more profitable than selling themManarrested under Terrorism Act Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

This obscures the marketwhen compared with conventional end use.“The benefit to the poultry industry is apparent.”Mr Lunny said: “That seems to be suggesting that you can sell a ton of oats to the market for use as food or feed at £ a ton, butyou burn it you’ll earn £, presumably under the RHI, and that is a potential illustration of the perverse incentive where the tarf income greatly exceeds the cost of the fuel.“Is that what was being discussed at that point ”Christopher Osborne, the UFU’s senior policy advisor, said: “Yes it was. And had I had the opportunity I would have factored that into my written statement [to the inquiry].“It was only recently that I was reminded of this. This was the end of March [or] beginning of April . Now, it’s not specically referring to wood pellets because obviously I don’t think oats can be used to basically fuel a boiler as such, but it was definitely a conversation along the lines of what people were hearing in terms of feedstock prices.”Mr Lunny said that while oats would be “an unusual biomass fuel, it probably qualies as biomass under the regulations from ”.Mr Osborne said that he did not believe that there was any discussion about the more relevant financial information – the cost of wood pellets or wood chip.He said that the information was never passed on to civil servants at Stormont because the UFU had not known the cost of wood fuel.RHI Inquiry: Weeks before leak to News Letter, UFU boss sent emails to DUP Spad Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

UFU chief executive Wesley Aston insisted that he had not connected his actions with what subsequently emerged in this newspaper The correspondence showed that in July  poultry farmer Tom Forgrave was lobbying the Ulster Farmers’ Unionto ask Stormont for a ‘grace period’ to allow those already in the process of installing boilers to get them at the most lucrative tarf, arguing that they had taken on huge bank loans on that basis.The UFU agreed to argue for a delay in changing the scheme and held a meeting at Stormont where civil servants handed the UFU a document which highlighted the cost of wood pellets – glaringly showing that the level of the uncapped subsidy was above the cost of fuel.But yesterday it was revealed that the emails had been sent to Dr Crawford on January   by Wesley Aston, the UFU’s chief executive.The DUP Spad forwarded them to John Robinson, then a fellow Spad and now the DUP’s chief spin doctor, and Mrs Foster’s then Spad Richard Bullick, with the comment: “Officials were briefing everyone related to the scheme about the proposed changes well in advance of any changes. I asked Wesley to send this through as proof that briefings and meetings were taking place. He is content for us to use this info.”Mr Aston yesterday insisted to the RHI Inquiry that the UFU’s relationship with Dr Crawford was no dferent to that which it had with other Spads, even though he was a former UFU colleague.Mr Aston told the inquiry that he had met Dr Crawford and had a “brief conversation” and he sent the emails “just on the basis of [it being] purely factual information, not knowing what was going to be subsequently done with those”.He said that Dr Crawford gave him no indication of how he was going to use the documentation and Mr Aston said he was not suspicious of what was going on even when the emails led to this newspaper asking awkward questions of the UFU.Inquiry barrister Donal Lunny put it to Mr Aston that there was evidence of Dr Crawford providing information to the UFU which gave it an advantage at earlier points and now it seemed that the UFU was helping him and the DUP. Mr Aston said it was “purely factual” and he would have done the same for any other Spad. But, when pressedhe had similar exchanges with any other Spad, Mr Aston said he had not done so on such a serious issue.Mr Lunny asked him whether he could see that with so much focus on the DUP, the documents he was providing “might be used to sht some of the focus on to the officials”.Mr Aston repeated that it was “purely factual”. When pressed on the issue again, he said he was surprised Dr Crawford could not access the emails within Stormont.Mr Lunny said that “emails of this type were ultimately leaked to a number of journalists”.Man arrested after children stabbed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"After this newspaper asked the UFU questions about its role in lobbying to keep the uncapped scheme open, Mr Aston forwarded the union’s responses to Dr Crawford – something he said was “a courtesy” because one of the questions related to Dr Crawford.It was put to Mr Aston that the UFU had not answered a question as to whether it regretted pressing for a delay in cost controls. When pressed several times to answer the question, Mr Aston said he regretted “the outcome from that delay” but it wasn’t solely responsible for that.Mr Lunny askedhe had asked Dr Crawford whether it was him who had leaked the emails “because they are at least some of the emails that were forwarded to him on January ”. Mr Aston said: “No, I didn’t at that stage.”Mr Lunny asked: “Would that not be a natural thing to ask – these are the emails that we sent you six weeks ago did you leak them to the News Letter ”Mr Aston said: “It may have been obvious now, but at the time, no.”try catch     .               ..

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water.

There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
