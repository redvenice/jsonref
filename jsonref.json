They still stand on view in the purpose-built Duveen Gallery.Greece has sought their return from the British Museum through the years, to no avail.The authenticity of Elgin\u0027s permit to remove the sculptures from the Parthenon has been widely disputed, especially as the original document has been lost. Many claim it was not legal.However, others argue that since the Ottomans had controlled Athens since 1460, their claims to the artefacts were legal and recognisable."},{"url":null,"title":"Space debris event forces ISS crew evasive action","story":"Share this article Kubela, speaking to Politico on Monday, echoed those thoughts as he said: \u0027What we see along our border is a sophisticated military infrastructure rolled out during the spring escalation, that is ready to be used for offensive operations. \u0027I cannot speculate on the exact scale of those operations, but back in 2014 it was unimaginable that Crimea would be seized by Russia — therefore I cannot exclude any scenario at this point.\u0027Mr Stoltenberg added: \u0027Any further provocation or aggressive actions by Russia would be of serious concern.

Photograph: John ThysPoolEPAEuropean Commission vice-president Maroš Šefcovic has warned of “very serious consequences” for EU-UK relations if London triggers article 16 of the Brexit protocol on Ireland, but welcomed the recent “change in tone” from British negotiator David Frost.Adopting a positive stance on some aspects of the talks at a meeting on Monday with the Seanad committee on Brexit, Mr Šefcovic said he hoped negotiators could “bring in agreement” on medicines issues before he meets again on Friday with Mr Frost.On the supply of medicines into the North, he promised to do “whatever it takes to address this issue” in line with industry requirements. Negotiators were focused “like a laser beam” on the question, he added.“We are here, ready to amend our own rules to solve this problem. Of course I would prefer to have a joint solution with the UK on this issue but we need to move quickly here.”Calling on Britain to reciprocate the EU’s offer last month to change how the protocol operates, he said Brussels needed to know “that there is also good faith from the other side” in the talks.There was no question over the commitments the EU made in the talks, he said. “If we say there is 80 per cent or 50 per cent cuts in respective checks you can be pretty sure we know what we are talking about.”ResolutionAsked by Fine Gael senator Barry Ward whether people could have faith in any resolution that might emerge, he said: “I would characterise my approach as very realistic, if our partners from the UK would engage, and I hope we will see more of it this week, then I’m absolutely sure can solve all these issues.”Responding to Sinn Féin senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, the commission vice-president he said any triggering of article 16 would have “very serious consequences” both for the North and the EU’s relationship with the UK.Article 16 is the last resort clause that allows either side to act unilaterally to address “serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. Repeated UK threats to trigger the clause have led to EU warnings of a trade war with Britain as the union could in retaliation suspend the trade and co-operation agreement (TCA) that was struck last Christmas.Mr Šefcovic said the basis for EU engagements with Britain was a sequence of deals starting with the UK withdrawal agreement, followed by the protocol and then the TCA.The EU’s objective in the talks was to establish a positive and stable relationship with Britain, Mr Šefcovic told the committee by video link. But he added: “I have to say that I worry about the rhetoric and action of the UK.”After increasingly sharp signals from London that Boris Johnson’s government might trigger article 16 this week after the Cop26 climate summit, Mr Frost relented a little in recent days by saying the talks process was not at an end and that there was still time to reach agreement.Mr Šefcovic, who met Mr Frost last Friday and will meet him again next Friday, promised to do his utmost to avoid the “dramatic development” of a trade war, adding that such an outcome would only aggravate the situation. “It would be up to us again to pick up the pieces,” he said in response to Fianna Fáil Senator Malcolm Byrne.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 outcome nowhere near enough say irish campaigners","story":"A protest over climate change in Dublin last week. Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN summit in Glasgow. Photograph: Damien StoranPAThe outcome of Cop26 falls far short of what is necessary to tackle the climate crisis, but countries who are climate leaders must show the way forward, “and let history judge the laggards”, according to Friends of the Earth Ireland (FoE).Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, though some welcomed gains on climate finance for poorer countries and increased funding for “adaptation” to help make climate-vulnerable states more resilient in face of inevitable impacts from global warming.“Glasgow was a staging post not a finishing line,” said FoE director Oisín Coghlan. He said what was clear now was that formal negotiations through this UN process “may never produce an outcome that reflects the urgency of the science and the imperative of justice. Not when the final text is effectively subject to a veto from any polluting country with a brass neck”.Collective agreement is no longer the limit on global action it once was, Mr Coghlan said. “While some countries are still dragging their heels others are beginning to pick up the pace. Equally, while fossil fuel companies are lobbying for the path of delay and destruction others are grasping the business opportunities of the race to zero.”The global climate movement was growing in strength and ersity, and this would continue in an effort to secure a better response by governments, he said.“We may not yet have succeeded in forging the international agreement we want but increasingly we can hold our national governments to the standards required by the 1.5-degree goal in the Paris agreement.“The two-steps forward, one-step back nature of the annual climate talks is deeply frustrating but we must pocket any modest gains from Glasgow – the first mention of phasing out of fossil fuels and the renewed commitment to adaptation finance for example – and ratchet up our demands for the next time,” he added.“Collectively our governments have not met the moment but our international movement emerges from Glasgow stronger than ever. We return home to push our national governments harder than ever to act in line with science and equity.”Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of international figures founded by Nelson Mandela, pushed repeatedly for greater ambition during the two-week long negotiations. She said it had made some progress, “but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty”.Climate activist Dr Lorna Gold, chairwoman of the Laudato Si Movement, said the outcome was a huge disappointment. “The only thing worse than this would have been no outcome. That would have spelt disaster. The outcome shows that the majority of leaders still do not yet fully accept the reality of the situation.”Last-minute watering down of critical language on phasing out coal deepened mistrust and did bode well for the road ahead, she added. “That said, this Cop was not just about the official outcome. Many key initiatives have been signed – including the agreement on methane and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to which Ireland signed up.”On the fringes, however, critical discussions were held on financial realignment, including value-based organisations rapidly shifting financial assets into clean energy and adaptation, she noted. “The awakening of global finance is good news. Cop26 has not been a disaster – but not a success either. Some would call it a ‘compromise’ – a ‘balanced outcome’. Sadly, a rapidly changing climate does not react to such human excuses.”The failure of global leaders to include “loss and damage” financing in the final agreement is “deeply disappointing” and a “missed opportunity” by the powerful nations who have contributed most to climate change, according to Trócaire.The overseas development agency said the deal failed to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities recover and rebuild after climate disasters.Trócaire head of policy and advocacy Siobhán Curran, who attended Cop26, said: “There were huge expectations that Cop26 would be the moment when wealthy countries stepped up and acknowledged they have done most to cause the climate crisis. They have turned their backs on indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, women and girls who desperately need support to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. This is a matter of great injustice.”Ms Curran said although the commitment to “urgently deliver” $100 billion (€87 billion) for climate finance was welcome, it is still a fraction of the amount that will be needed in the face of the climate emergency.Trócaire chief executive Caoimhe de Barra said: “This was an exclusionary Cop. Civil society found it difficult to access the Cop sessions, and many were excluded from the negotiation area.“People from the global South and countries most affected by the climate crisis were under-represented . . . yet they are the most affected communities and their voices needed to be heard.”Simon Murtagh of Oxfam Ireland said: “At every level, Cop26 did not deliver the goals we sought urgent action on. The process couldn’t deliver for small island states facing immediate destruction. Nor could it deliver for two million Kenyans currently left destitute by the effects of climate change, nor for millions more in Yemen, Madagascar or central America, who face hunger and destitution caused by climate change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"plan on mother and baby home redress to go to cabinet","story":"The compensation  is expected to cost more than €800 million in payments to the former residents. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThe Government will today announce its compensation scheme for residents of mother and baby homes as well as an “action plan” on access to birth records and on projects to memorialise the experience of those who lived in the homes.It is expected that the Cabinet will approve the proposals by Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman this morning before an announcement and press conference later today.The compensation scheme will be wider than that recommended by the Commission of Inquiry into the homes, whose report was criticised by many survivors and their advocates. It is expected to cost more than €800 million in payments to the former residents.The compensation scheme is expected to cover women who spent less than six months in the homes and also those who were resident in them after 1974 – the year the lone parents’ allowance was begun – a departure from the Commission’s report.There are estimated to be some 50,000 women and children who were resident in the homes. All will be eligible for compensation, though at different thresholds, it is understood. Some former residents will also be eligible for medical cards.There has been considerable wrangling in Government over the potential cost of the compensation scheme, with some officials citing the example of the redress scheme for the former residents of industrial schools - many of whom suffered horrendous abuse - which was expected to cost €200 million but ended up costing in excess of €1.5 billion.Mr O’Gorman wrote to survivors and advocacy groups for former home residents last week, saying that he will seek approval from Government for a “detailed and costed” payment proposal.The aim, he said, is to introduce a “non-adversarial and straightforward” application procedure.Birth recordsLegislation to allow adopted people access to their birth records – which they currently do not enjoy by right – is also being prepared. The joint Oireachtas Committee on Children is currently completing the pre-legislative scrutiny phase, and will submit a report to the Minister in the coming weeks. It is hoped that the new law, enshrining the right of adopted people to access their original birth certificate and therefore the identity of their birth mother, will be on the statute books next year.The Cabinet is also set to consider the final report of the Seafood Sector task force, and the State claims agency report on sensitive cases. A memo on the use of antigen testing is due to come from Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, which is expected to address the use of the tests in schools, as well as the issue of subsidizing the costs.The Department of Transport will bring a report on its capital expenditure, while Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath will brief Cabinet on arrangements on the composition of the Top Level Appointments Committee - charged with making senior public service appointments.There were also indications the Government may consider a retail banking review undertaken by the Department of Finance."},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in climate policy remains hazy as debate on costs heats up","story":"When asked in interviews, Sinn Féin  leader Mary Lou McDonald refused to commit the party to a specific figure for emissions cuts in agriculture. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Sinn Féin’s policies on climate change could be summed up as follows: big on justice, hazy on transition. The party, in its documents and public pronouncements, majors on the twin concepts of climate justice and just transition to the exclusion of almost everything else. Sinn Féin’s manifesto for the 2020 general election is a good example: “Without a Government policy that is framed by climate justice and a just transition, the leadership and direction of climate change will become the plaything of bankers and corporate investors. They will be concerned with only one thing – how to make a buck out of the crisis. That is what they do and it is killing the planet.“We cannot allow corporate interests to push false solutions and dump the cost of climate action on to the shoulders of ordinary communities. Sinn Féin is committed to climate justice and a just transition for Ireland, north and south.”It is clear from this and more recent statements on the climate crisis what Sinn Féin is against. But what exactly is the party for, when it comes to supporting policies that will significantly reduce Ireland’s carbon emissions? And, more pertinently, how does Sinn Féin propose to pay for just transition?Renewed focus came on these questions in the week leading up to Cop26 in Glasgow. The trigger was a Sinn Féin Private Members’ Bill on wind turbines that happened to be chosen for debate on that very week. The Bill was drafted back in 2016 amid local opposition in the midlands to wind farms. The proposed legislation was quickly withdrawn from the Dáil schedule by party whip Pádraig Mac Lochlainn for obvious reasons. It proposed a set-back for turbines (the distance from the nearest house) equal to 10 times their height. It also all but banned the export of energy from turbines.The Bill would have severely restricted the further development of on-land wind power in Ireland. Mac Lochlainn accepted the Bill was out of date and needed to be updated.“The only place you could have put up wind turbines in Ireland under that Bill would have been Ballycroy national park in Mayo,” said a TD from another party, exaggerating only slightly. When asked, she refused to commit Sinn Féin to a specific figure for emissions cuts in agriculture. She also said the State should refuse to sign the Mercosur trade deal with South American countries instead of taking issue with Irish farmers about the size of the national herd. She repeated her party’s opposition to carbon tax, and said she also supported a temporary scrapping of VAT on energy bills.The only tangible measure to reduce, or contain, emissions she referenced was her call for a moratorium on the building of more data centres.McDonald is usually adept at forcing Taoiseach Micheál Martin on to his back foot in the Dáil but he wheeled the scrum a few days later when she demanded the removal of VAT of fossil fuels.“It’s about time you got off the fence,” Martin told McDonald. “You’re having an each-way bet, every week, every month in this House, for the last number of years on the issue.” For most of the past five years, Sinn Féin has focused on two key policy areas: housing and health. On each it has published extensive policy documents. In contrast, its climate-change policies are lacking in detail and fragmented.A good example is the section on climate change in its alternative budget this year. Additional spending for climate action is €420 million, which seems respectable on the face of it. But when you take a closer look, it emerges that €107 million of that is an increase in the payment for suckler beef animals to €300 per cowcalf pair.It is a surprise to see that being described as a climate-change measure. To some, it is in fact the opposite of climate action. In an industry where there are no caps on cattle numbers, increasing the subsidy in the past has increased the herd size and resulted in a consequent increase in emissions.Sinn Féin’s agriculture spokesman Matt Carthy says the measure is to support family farms rather than less sustainable, commercial beef farms. But, as a climate-change policy, that seems like choosing the least bad solution. In itself, it is highly unlikely that such a powerful incentive to invest in suckler herds will lead to a meaningful reduction in emissions, if at all. Climate action could be the party’s Achilles heel in the run-up to the next election. It is hard to pin down Sinn Féin on where exactly where it stands, especially on how to finance the transition if it continues to oppose increases in carbon tax.The party’s spokesman on the issue is Darren O’Rourke, a TD for Meath East and a former health policy adviser to the party. He reiterates Sinn Féin’s support for reducing emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, and for the principle of five-year carbon budgets.In fact, O’Rourke makes it clear that Sinn Féin does not differ greatly from the Government’s 2030 policies of having a million electric vehicles on the road, to retrofit 500,000 homes to B2 standards, and to reduce agriculture emissions – albeit by an unstated percentage. The party agrees with the 2:1 ratio for public transport over roads but not uniformly, according to a 2019 paper. ‘Low-hanging fruit’O’Rourke says there is “low-hanging fruit” the Government has failed to grasp. He cites wind power, solar power and micro-generation as three examples. He also argues that he and Senator Lynn Boylan have a “full body of work” in terms of being constructive in Opposition.He cites their contributions during the line-by-line consideration of climate legislation at committee, including the many detailed amendments they drafted. When asked if the party lacks a comprehensive and coherent climate policy, he says Sinn Féin is proposing a range of measures for housing, transport and energy, while also supporting many of the Government measures.“The question we are trying to answer is how do you orient the State intervention to the places where it is most needed.”The party is not totally opposed to carbon taxes, only when “people do not have alternatives” says O’Rourke. “It’s all about time and context.” Electorally, though, it would be very difficult for Sinn Féin to re-embrace carbon taxes without experiencing a backlash. Climate change is a costly item. The Climate Action Plan has a predicted cost of €125 billion. When it emerged that the bill for retrofitting 500,000 homes was put at €28 billion, a number of quantity surveyors said that was an underestimate. Most of the money will be private but the State will be expected to stump up some of the cash. In 2019, Sinn Féin questioned in a policy paper if there was mass demand for retrofitting houses. It said deep retrofit could “only be viewed as a long-term measure with potential for tiny incremental gains over 30 to 40 years. In reality, the gains from current retrofit models over the next decade will be marginal and the best opportunity for change arises from new builds”. Carbon tax revenue is expected to hit about €1 billion per annum by 2030. Asked where alternative funding might be raised, O’Rourke agrees it will be challenge. He refers to green bonds, to changes in European Union fiscal rules on borrowing and to levies on fossil-fuel companies – but there is the danger, he accepts, those charges will be passed on to customers. “Funding it is a huge challenge for all of us, for all parties,” he says. "},{"url":null,"title":"imperfect cop26 deal builds platform for hastening climate action","story":"Exhausted Cop26 delegates as they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks. Photograph: Robert PerryEPAAs they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks, exhausted Cop26 negotiators – some shocked at last-minute compromise on the vexatious issue of coal – knew they’d been through a bruising battle where “uncomfortable” compromise marked the outcome.In spite of this, tangible commitments, and even progressive moves to shift course, were nailed down. For the first time a Cop agreement targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming. The tone is much different to the usual arcane language of UN climate summit outcomes. The 2015 Paris Agreement is finally moving to gearing-up stage.There is no doubt now that keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees is the priority of the 197 signatory countries, who can no longer put vague commitments on the table in the hope that the world might warm by less than two degrees.Emerging into the Glasgow daylight probably provided a far greater shock for negotiating teams, especially political leaders heading up delegations, as the reaction was marked by a wave of deep disappointment. Reaction in climate-vulnerable states can be summed up by one word – despair.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan admitted that dramatic twist was “gut wrenching” as India – the world’s third biggest emitter – pushed for “phase down” rather than “phase out” of coal. This prompted a rushed manoeuvre by the European Union, China and United States to amend the text in the interests of holding “what we’ve got”, though it was against protocols and the final political, rather than legal, decision was already agreed going into the final plenary.The critical target of keeping global warming to within 1.5 degrees was still alive, Cop26 president Alok Sharma insisted a view backed by those big players.“What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity,” Ryan said.Unfinished businessMuch unfinished business, however, is confirmed by definitive analysis published in Glasgow showing all promises made before and at the UN summit make for a 2.4 degree rise in temperatures, where already dangerous climate impacts would become catastrophic.“For many countries, two degrees is a death sentence,” executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said.The deal backs “best available science” to inform actions. Applying that framework, there is no sugar-coating the standout failure of ambition on actions to curb emissions, leaving our fragile planet still hanging by a thread.That said, there is enough to suggest the world is facing into a decade of scaled-up action. In that scenario the request that parties “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022” becomes the key enabler. A request in “UN speak” is close to a demand.The temperature issue aside, this was the most productive Cop since Paris. Decisions on doubling adaptation finance and setting up a body to assist countries most impacted by climate disruption represents progress, but more is needed.When it comes to hard money, the long-awaited $100 billion a year for developing countries under climate finance will be realised, while adaptation funding to help vulnerable countries adjust for inevitable climate impacts is set to be in excess of $1 trillion a year by 2025.While Cop26 failed to generate dedicated finance for “loss and damage” because of resistance by wealthy countries, vulnerable countries agreed to compromise on the understanding more help would come soon. Ireland has offered to co-host a “dialogue” to come up with ways of supporting those most affected.The outcome also finalises the most contentious elements of the Paris Agreement rule book, encapsulated in article six, six years after the landmark deal was done. This includes facilitation of a global carbon-trading market that closes glaring loopholes such as “double counting” of carbon credits.CompromiseA historic proposal to “phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” was watered down part of the compromise needed to agree a deal by inserting “phase down”. It has left a bad aftertaste, especially for the EU.The reality, however, is the economics of coal-powered electricity generation no longer add up in face of cheap solar and wind energy. The coal industry that once brought wealth to the developed world is coming to a rapid end, probably by 2030. Developing countries are predicted to follow the same course over the following decade.Outside the COP process, groups of countries committed to ending fossil fuel extraction, to accelerate the phasing out of coal, to tackling methane and to ending deforestation. If all of this is delivered, acceleration of decarbonisation over the coming decade is realisable. New alliances between public and private sectors have been forged, especially on switching to green energy. There was also a strong indication that the financial world is gearing up for transitioning to a world of net-zero emissions.Analysis by Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency indicate fresh pledges made over the past fortnight have the potential to reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees – a significant stride toward the 1.5 target.Delivery reinforced by meaningful near-term commitments is critical. Being unable to bend the emissions curve downwards this decade will put huge pressure on the remaining carbon budget for “keeping 1.5 degrees alive”.The Cop26 outcome has been described as a political lifeline for accelerating action to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, but science indicates forcing down the global emissions curve in just nine years is essential.As climate scientist Prof John Sweeney has highlighted, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has four out of five possible scenarios which indicate the world will exceed 1.5 degrees over the next 20 years.The one that keeps us to within 1.5 degrees is a trajectory the world is nowhere near at present. It will be some years before we know if Cop26 has helped bridge the gap.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Saint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine booster jabs rolled over 40s","story":"Tourists may be forced to have booster jabs if they want to go on holiday without restrictions, the Prime Minister has said, as the rollout of third vaccines to over-40s is set to get under way.On Monday, government scientific advisors announced the extension of the booster jab programme, with over-40s able to get their third jabs once five months have passed since their second. Bookings open from next week, with many eligible in the run-up to Christmas.The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) also signalled that boosters could be offered to all adults in future.As he urged those eligible to take up the jabs, Boris Johnson said boosters might be necessary in order to “make life easier” and travel without quarantine and testing. I think that we will be making plans to add the booster dose to the NHS Covid travel pass, he said. But again, I think what the general lesson is for anybody who wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will, on the whole, make your life easier in all kinds of ways, including foreign travel.So I would just say, if you\u0027re thinking about that, that this is yet another reason to get it done.The JCVI also announced that 16 and 17-year-olds will be offered second doses. It is understood that for groups not yet eligible for booster jabs, two doses would still be recognised as fully vaccinated. The latest change to the rules on boosters means an extra eight million people will soon be eligible for third jabs, along with around 32 million people - including all over-50s - who are in priority groups. It comes amid continued concern over the speed of the rollout, and warnings that the most vulnerable must not be pushed out of the queue.In the first two months since the first boosters were administered in the UK, 12.8 million adults have had a third jab, although 20 million are now eligible for them.By Christmas, around 32 million, including the vast majority of those aged 50 and over, will be due a booster, along with those who are newly eligible.Health officials insisted the NHS has the capacity to cope with a significant increase in uptake, but said the most vulnerable must be prioritised if millions of people end up competing for the same slots.At a Downing Street press conference on Monday, Mr Johnson said: It\u0027s very clear that getting three jabs, getting your booster, will become an important fact and it will make life easier for you in all sorts of ways and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that and I think that is increasingly obvious.The booster massively increases your protection. It takes it right back up to over 90 per cent.And as we can see from what\u0027s happening, the two jabs sadly do start to wane. So we\u0027ve got to be responsible, and we\u0027ve got to reflect that fact in the way we measure what constitutes full vaccination.Mr Johnson also said he could not rule out a Christmas lockdown, warning that Britain could be hit by a “blizzard from the east” with cases “ticking up very sharply” in some European countries.He added: We don\u0027t see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B, we\u0027re sticking with Plan A.But what we have certainly got to recognise is there is a storm of infection out there in parts of Europe, you can see those numbers ticking up very sharply in some of our continental friends.And we\u0027ve just got to recognise that there is always a risk that a blizzard could come from the east again, as the months get colder.The best protection for our country is for everybody to go forward and get their booster.On Monday morning Professor Wei Shen Lim, JCVI chairman, said: “It may well be that adults who are under 40 years might require a booster dose or a third dose at some point.”While no decision has yet been taken, he said scientists were “looking very closely at the data”.The JCVI recommendation on Monday followed research which found a third dose could cut infection rates by 80 per cent, bringing protection against symptomatic infection to more than 93 per cent, in those aged 50 and over.Prof Jonathan Van Tam, deputy chief medical officer, said: “Age is still the biggest risk factor. The elderly, adults at risk and health and social care workers remain the top priority for boosters. “And we should never have a case where 40-year-olds without risk conditions are being vaccinated en masse, whilst many 60 and 70-year-olds are waiting for their boosters.”At the Downing Street press conference, pregnant women were also urged to come forward for jabs, amid warnings that 98 per cent of those admitted to hospital with Covid have not been vaccinatedProfessor Chris Whitty warned of “preventable admissions” to intensive care as he urged women who are pregnant or wishing to get pregnant to get their Covid-19 vaccination.England\u0027s chief medical officer told a Downing Street press conference: Based on academic data from February 1 to September 30...1,714 pregnant women were admitted to hospital with Covid. Of those, 1,681, which is to say 98 per cent, had not been vaccinated.And if you go to those who are very severely ill in intensive care, of 235 women admitted to ICU, 232 of them - over 98 per cent - had not been vaccinated.These are preventable admissions to ICU and there have been deaths. All the medical opinion is really clear that the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks in every area. “This is a universal view among doctors and among the midwife advisory groups and among the scientific advisory groups.So can I please encourage all women who are pregnant or wishing to become pregnant to get their vaccination.Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said on Monday: “We welcome today’s announcement by the JCVI, on the extension of the booster campaign to 40- to 49-year-olds. This further strengthens our ability to ensure people are protected against Covid-19 and saves lives. “Our safety monitoring to date shows that Covid-19 vaccines continue to have a positive safety profile for the majority of people. The vast majority of reactions that are reported relate to expected side effects such as injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms, as was seen in our initial assessment. Our proactive monitoring of the safety of booster doses does not raise any new concerns. We also welcome the recommendation for 16- to 17-year-olds to come forward and have a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. People can be reassured that when we gave approval for the Pfizer vaccine for those 16 years and over in December 2020, we had thoroughly reviewed all the clinical trial data.More from NewsCarers ‘should be offered £500 bonuses to stop them leaving for hospitality jobs’GCSEs failing to prepare children for modern world, say private school headsLives at risk as number waiting for vital heart scans soarsPrince Harry releases 15-point action plan to defeat fake newsSki resorts ‘raring to go’, insist French as infections surge in EuropeCamilla, Kate, Sophie - and the delicate politics of the next Royal chapterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"every little helps no 10 hopes nothing stops people getting","story":"“This Christmas, nothing’s stopping us,” Tesco has declared in a new festive advert so political that it could have been commissioned by the Downing Street nudge unit.The commercial, which shows Father Christmas clutching his Covid vaccine passport at UK immigration, was broadcast just 48 hours before the Government extended the booster programme to 40-somethings.Announcing the plan on Monday, Boris Johnson argued that high booster uptake is the key to saving the holiday season, placing Christmas freedoms firmly in the hands – or, more accurately, the arms – of the public. Every little helps, after all.The Government has so far resisted calls to implement “Plan B” Covid measures, relying instead on increased immunity from third jabs to keep cases at manageable levels and avoid another winter wave.At a press conference on Monday, the Prime Minister said: “It’s going well,” but warned: “If we want to avoid restrictions on our daily lives, we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.”Thankfully, there are encouraging signs that the booster programme is working – at least among the over-50s.Real-world figures released by the UK Health Security Agency on Monday showed that boosters give 93.1 per cent protection against symptomatic infection for Britons who had the AstraZeneca vaccine. Before the booster, protection had slipped to 47 per cent six months after a second jab. It is a similar story among Pfizer jab recipients, with protection rising from 69 per cent to 94 per cent.Data from Israel suggest boosted over-60s are 10 times less likely to suffer a Covid infection than those with just two doses. There was also an 18.7-fold reduction against hospitalisations and a 14.7-fold reduction against mortality.Data from the Office for National Statistics, released last week, showed antibody levels are also rising again in the over-50s after slowly declining since the summer.However, there is one flaw in the Government’s under-50s booster extension plan to save Christmas – the majority will not be eligible for a third jab until after the holidays.The first under-50s received their jabs in mid-April, about four months after the programme started for the oldest and most vulnerable.At the time, ministers recommended an interval of 12 weeks between jabs, which was not changed to eight weeks until July. It means that most will not be eligible until mid-January.It is also unknown whether younger people will see a similar drop in immunity to older people. Research suggests waning antibodies are less of a problem in younger groups, who mount a stronger initial response.Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency showed the AstraZeneca vaccine’s effectiveness against symptomatic infection nearly halves, to 36 per cent, five months after the second jab for the over-65s.In contrast, in 40-year-olds to 64-year-olds, effectiveness remains at 57 per cent at five months, having dropped by just nine per cent.Offering a booster to 40-somethings is also unlikely to have a large impact on deaths and admissions.According to latest figures from  the UK Health Security Agency, the number of double-jabbed 40-year-old to 49-year-olds dying after testing positive for Covid in the last three weeks was just 32 – just 1.5 per cent of the total. They also account for just five per cent of emergency admissions.So the decision to extend the programme may be more political than practical, allowing the Government to be seen to still be making an effort to control the virus even as it draws up plans to dial down its response.Documents leaked last weekend revealed that mandarins are working on Operation Rampdown, which will take Covid off an emergency footing and back into the realms of everyday healthcare.Even Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, signalled that the country is nearing the end of the crisis as he urged people to come forward to be boosted so that Britain can “get on and finish the job”.Modelling also suggests the UK has little to fear from another winter wave. New figures from University College London suggested deaths will remain at an average of 150 a day for the next week before steadily declining towards 25 a day by the new year.The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine correctly forecast that cases would start to fall in November, with Christmas seeing low rates of infection. On Monday, Mr Johnson reaffirmed his belief that there is “nothing in the current data” to trigger Plan B.Prof Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, confirmed that cases, deaths and admissions are no longer rising and have been “broadly flat” for many weeks.“The number of people in hospital is mercifully a lot lower than in the peak,” he said at Monday’s press conference. “Covid numbers are not going up as you are seeing in continental Europe, and if they were you would have to look again.”However, he warned that the NHS is under “very significant pressure” from winter effects and the catch-up from Covid. Officials are clearly concerned that the health service could face a worse than normal flu season, while struggling to clear the backlog of treatment put off during the height of the pandmeic.If that is the case, preventing even small numbers of Covid patients will be crucial to avoid overwhelming the NHS this Christmas.So, ‘tis the season to be boosted.

Boris Johnson threw the kitchen sink at it. The Royal Family hosted receptions for multi-billionaires. The Foreign Office sent climate envoys around the world. Glasgow would show the world that what France could do six years ago at the Paris climate conference, Britain could do better. But whereas the French knew what they were doing in Paris, the British were all at sea in Glasgow. The result was a display of the rank amateurishness of the British state. Unsurprisingly, it ended in tears. Literally.If Boris Johnson and his ministers had done their homework, they would have known they were on a hiding to nothing. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol failed because it excluded the developing world from cutting their emissions. The West attempted to remedy this at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 with a climate treaty that would bring the major emerging economies under a multilateral regime of emissions targets and timetables. The attempt was sunk by China, India, South Africa and Brazil acting in concert.The West needed some sort of climate agreement to justify their domestic climate policies. Global warming is global. The West accounts for a declining share of global emissions. “This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,” Barack Obama had boasted in 2008. Obama and the West were desperate for a climate agreement, even a fig leaf of one. The Paris agreement is the climate equivalent of Mikhail Gorbachev’s Sinatra Doctrine under which the captive nations of eastern Europe could do it their way. It signalled that the Soviet Union had lost the Cold War. In similar fashion, the Paris agreement signalled that the West had accepted its defeat and had given up its attempt to create a multilateral regime of emissions cuts. Instead, the Paris agreement is based on nationally determined contributions. Each party to the agreement would do it its way.Because Paris included 1.5 in its text, the IPCC brought forward the indicative timetable for net zero from the second half of the current century to 2050. In the dying days of her premiership, Theresa May decided to make net zero her legacy. In 2019, it was incorporated as a binding target under the 2008 Climate Change Act after a ninety-minute debate in the House of Commons, even though MPs had no idea how much it would cost or whether it was remotely feasible. But one thing is clear. However much net zero costs Britain, it is pointless for Britain to decarbonise if the rest of the world doesn’t. The regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Climate Change Act signed by Ed Miliband as climate and energy secretary could not have been clearer: “The UK continuing to act while the rest of the world does not, would result in a large net cost for the UK.” The benefits of UK climate action would be distributed around the world, but the UK would bear all the costs.The Climate Change Act was passed in the run up to the Copenhagen climate conference which was going to produce a binding climate treaty. “Showing leadership through the Climate Change Act, the UK will help to drive a global deal,” Miliband asserted, showing that climate hubris is embraced by all Britain’s political parties. Now, for a second time, a UN climate conference has produced a dud. The mantra of Britain leading and the rest of the world following has ended in tears and in humiliation. The question mark over net zero has been answered. After Glasgow, we now know that net zero is all pain for no gain. With Britain’s political class committed to the dead end of net zero, they will not act to take Britain off this disastrous path. Roll on a net zero referendum.Rupert Darwall is a senior fellow of the RealClear Foundation and author of Green Tyranny.More from NewsCarers ‘should be offered £500 bonuses to stop them leaving for hospitality jobs’GCSEs failing to prepare children for modern world, say private school headsLives at risk as number waiting for vital heart scans soarsPrince Harry releases 15-point action plan to defeat fake newsSki resorts ‘raring to go’, insist French as infections surge in EuropeCamilla, Kate, Sophie - and the delicate politics of the next Royal chapterMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tuesday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Welcome to your early morning news briefing from The  - a round-up of the top stories we are covering on Tuesday.

Heres everything you need to know about the -page plan dubbed Operation RampdownThe Covid exit strategy codenamed Operation Rampdown considers ways to cut down on Covid protocols Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika Padin:,  Nov | commentsA secret Whitehall plan detailing a new Covid exit strategy has reportedly been leaked to The Mail on Sunday. Marked as ‘Official Sensitive’, the plan is believed to have been drawn up by the senior Government officials tasked with winding down Britainaposs battle against the Covid pandemic. The report gives a glimpse of how le might look post-Covid.According to a source, the documents dubbed Operation Rampdown reveals officials are examining aposwhat activities can we start ramping down before April apos and what the aposend stateapos of Britainaposs response to Covid should be after April.The Rampdown strategy is expected to detail how much of the Governmentaposs £ billion emergency programme funding will be dismantled. Here are five things you need to know about the Covid exit strategy. Self-isolation could be axedThe strict rules that force those who test positive for Covid to self-isolate could be scrapped under the exit strategy. The self-isolation laws were extended last September, meaning those who caught the virus and any unvaccinated people who were exposed to it were required to self-isolate for ten days. It suggests that there will no longer be a need for mandatory isolation once legal powers expire in March. This could also mean that the scheme that pays out £ to the low-income groups self-isolating will also be axed. No more free Covid tests Under the Covid response plan, anyone can request free lateral flow tests which will be delivered at home.But this universal free Covid testing could be scrapped under the Rampdown strategy. Instead, the dossier reveals that officials maybe preparing to kick-start a aposprivate testing marketapos in which companies will charge people for tests. This could see around  firms offering  dferent testing products are already apparently undergoing the accreditation process. ‘Test and Trace’ system might be shut down The national Test and Trace service, which was set up in May  and handed a £billion budget to identy those exposed to the virus, is expected to be dramatically cut next year. The responsibility to trace infections could be handed over from the NHS and local authorities. Contact tracing was the responsibility of local public health officials before the pandemic.Focus on tackling local outbreaks Ministers will be presented with a list of aposcore sapos that will be needed to respond to any future devastating outbreak. This includes new plans codenamed Rising Tide, which details how to respond to any new mutant strain of the virus arriving in the UK. Learning to live with Covid at aposendemicapos levels for years The virus is expected to remain widespread within the population, but the documents details that Britain will have to learn to ‘live with the virus.’ The aim of any future government strategies is likely to be treating Covid like any other respiratory infection or seasonal flu. Everything about the exit strategy is still speculation, with a Government spokesman clarying last night that the future plans to tackle Covid remain under review and that no decisions have been taken about next year.

For too long, mental health has been ignored, treated as less important than physical health. But attitudes have changed and we all realise its importance. All, it seems, except the Government. The last decade or so of Tory rule has seen mental health provision slashed to the bone. Services have gone, units closed, beds disappeared. Those in charge have been careless. It’s bad enough during normal times. But in a pandemic it’s downright dangerous.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Now the seeds they have sown are bearing fruit. Last year every hospital had , people in a mental health crisis brought to AE by ambulance. That’s a % jump since . The system couldn’t cope anyway. Now it’s breaking. Ambulances are backing up outside hospitals, waiting lists are at all-time highs, paramedics and police are struggling to cope. The solutions are clear: proper funding for health services and proper provision for mental health, a revolution in social care, better pay and conditions for our health service staff. It’s a lot, but this Government has a knack of finding money when it needs to. This isn’t for a trip to the Cayman Islands though. This is big money to save our NHS, end the mental health crisis and enable our health service do what it does best: caring for people and saving lives.

This is a universal view among doctors and among the midwe advisory groups and among the scientic advisory groups. “So can I please encourage all women who are pregnant or wishing to become pregnant to get their vaccination.”Prof Whitty said “we’re beginning to see a winter respiratory effect” of other viruses impacting on the coronavirus pandemic.“There has already been a very signicant increase in eastern Europe which is still ongoing, with signicant numbers of people dying, in particular among the unvaccinated. “That has now moved westward and, as you can see, is now increasing signicantly, also in many western European countries. “We all knew – everywhere in Europe we knew – that as we went into winter, into the typical respiratory virus flu season, that the risks would be greater, and I think this is a demonstration of the fact that we’re beginning to see a winter respiratory effect.”  The Prime Minister, meanwhile, has extended the booster programme to the over-s in a bid to avoid a Christmas lockdown. He told a press briefing: “Clearly we cannot rule anything out and the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to – non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions – get the boosters.” He added: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent,” he said. “Those countries with lower vaccination rates have tended to see bigger surges in infection and in turn been forced to respond with harsher measures while those countries with higher vaccination rates have so far fared better. “It shows us thatwe want to control the epidemic here in the UK andwe want to avoid restrictions on our daily lives we must all get vaccinated as soon as we are eligible.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to £.m a year in directoraposs loans from his firm Saliston Ltd between  and . Although it does not specically identy directoraposs loans, the MPaposs code of conduct requires directors to declare taxable expenses, allowances and benefits. The Leader of the House of Commons stated that he was an unremunerated director and shareholder of the firm but did not mention he had taken out the loans. By using directoraposs loans he was able to borrow the large sum at very low interest rates.  UK company Saliston Ltd has previously been described as a holding company by Mr Rees-Mogg, with £m property assets, understood to include a Mayfair house. Saliston also has a stake in Mr Rees-Moggaposs asset management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP, the offshore parent firm of Somerset Capital ManagementLtd. He paid just £, interest to Saliston on £m of loans over three years, a rate of just .%. Mr Rees-Mogg was one of three founding membersapos of investment management firm Somerset Capital Management LLP in . He said his £m in loans were not earnings, so he was not required to declare them to Parliament and he had not broken any rules. He told the Mail on Sunday that the  loan was primarily used to buy and refurbish his £.m home in Westminster and added: All loans have either been repaid with interest in accordance with HMRC rules or paid as idends and taxed accordingly. But Thangam Debbonaire, Shadow Leader of the Commons, has called on Mr Rees-Mogg to come clean about his interests and called on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone to investigate. Ms Debbonaire said: This would appear to be yet another egregious breach of the rules. A Cabinet minister failing to declare millions in additional income is unacceptable. Downing Street declined to comment further on Monday.AskedBoris Johnson was comfortable with the situation, the PMaposs official spokesman said: I think the Leader of the House has made it clear that he has declared all his interests clearly in the Commons register and to the Cabinet Office.Comment MORE ON HMRCHouse of CommonsPoliticsJacob Rees-Mogg\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The brick and plaster section was carefully cut out of the wall of an empty electrical shop by removal experts at the weekend The shop was previously on the market for £,. However but it saw its value leap by at least another £, after Banksyaposs work, which showed a child with a crowbar, appeared in August. But now the propertyaposs owner has decided to remove the artwork from the building in Lowestoft, Suffolk. A video shows a yellow telehandler tearing out part of the wall featuring the graffiti, which was protected with a screen and wooden boards.  Workmen then loaded the wall slab onto a truck, which took it to an undisclosed location. It remains unclear whether the artwork will be sold at auction, though previous Banksy pieces have reeled in millions under the hammer. Furious locals have blasted the proprietor for removing the artwork. It was one of  pieces made in Banksyaposs Great British Spraycation project on the east coast of England.On Facebook, resident Brandon Eames described the removal as stupidity and disrespectful.He wrote: Now being shipped off to sell at public auction.. This is terrible. Why spend the money to protect it then just take it away...  Fellow local Matthew Cook said: Greed, lack of understanding, lack of respect. Remove a painted artwork all because who did it... its a joke to be honest and should have been allowed. Sets a bad precedent. Lynda Palmer added: So so sad, perhaps he will come back and do another one . But somewhere it wonapost be taken away from. The building, which previously hosted Lowestoft Electrical, saw its market value jump from £, to £, after the Banksy artwork appeared.

I felt really blessed, she said. It was a high risk pregnancy, but they all got to really good weights. However, it was very dficult by the end of my pregnancy. Even getting dressed was dficult and I was in pain just sitting down. Theyaposre very settled babies but the biggest challenge comes at feeding time when you’ve three babies all wanting to be fed at the same time.

Emergex, a company from Oxfordshire, have created the patch, which is said to be more long-lasting than regular Covid vaccinations. The company hopes that their patch will trigger a response that kills T cells, which could prevent the virus from even spreading. Chief executive officer of Emergex and emeritus professor of molecular medicine at UCL Thomas Rademacher said: Our T cell priming vaccine for Covid has been specically designed to stimulate a T cell response to kill viral infected cells before they become factories for the virus.  The preclinical data we have suggests that our vaccine will elicit a strong T cell response similar to the longer lasting immune response that is found after many natural viral infections. Our vaccine is targeted to generate an immune response against highly conserved internal parts of the virus and potentially protect us against current and new iants and related strains of coronaviruses such as SARS-. The Emergex vaccine contains an antigen only found on the surface of infected cells.  This stimulates the immune system to activate a specic T cell that searches for cells with this protein on their surface and, when found, it hits the aposkill switchapos and destroys it. The vaccine is entering stage one clinical trials, which will see it administered to  people in Lausanne, Switzerland. If successful, it could be available by . Other companies are also developing Covid vaccines that are given through skin patches. In Australia, researchers are also testing one that contains , microneedles.

Phil Cheung, who was also known as DJ Chill, died before doctors could determine what form of cancer he was facing. He was  when he died after a short cancer battle, leaving his community aposdevastated.aposHis close friend Jackie Coade was at his side for his entire cancer journey and spoke to Belfast Live about the legacy he has left.She said: He was such a lovely person who was always thinking of other people - he did a lot of charity work and would have been involved in a lot of events through the Marketplace Theatre in Armagh, he was the DJ who always gave his time and would have never asked for anything in . Phil was a popular DJ in Northern Ireland as well as Ibiza and Liverpool, and had friends all over the world who have been left heartbroken by his sudden death - with big names such as Seb Fontaine taking a moment to pay their respects.  As well as being a highly respected DJ and figure in the music industry, Phil also worked for a company in Benburb doing accounts where he never missed a day and was fiercely dedicated to all he did. Jackie continued: He was amazing, absolutely amazing and we were so incredibly proud of him. As his friends, we knew how brilliant he was but when you read the comments people have made and who has made them shows how many people he touched. He had two weeks and four days from diagnosis to death, he didnapost even have time to get his head around it at all. Itaposs just so so tragic. There is a really important health message in all of this - pleaseyour body feels dferent oryou notice something wrong, I know the health service is under so much pressure at the moment, but please go get checked because Phil was always thinking of other people and didnapost want to take anything away from someone  who is really unwell. Jackie and Philaposs closest friends thanked the staff at Craigavon Area Hospital who cared for him in his final weeks and treated him like family despite the pressure they have been facing already this winter. The staff couldnapost have done more for him - they were truly outstanding even whilst under signicant pressure, they loved him so much and looked after him so well and we canapost thank them enough, she said. We canapost believe that we have had to organise a funeral for him, canapost comprehend it at all as he was only  years old and he was so young to only have two weeks and four days. Phil died before he was able to get the full diagnosis of what cancer he was fighting. He just didnapost have the time to get his head around this and even talking about it was making it real but we did try and keep it as positive as we could to keep him focused but sadly on Friday we got the call to say time was short. Weaposve had so many highs and lows over the last two weeks but he was so brave and fought it so hard and he really tried to keep a positive mind which was just him as he was always a very positive person and would have looked for the good in every situation and in every person.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Sadly, Phil passed away very peacefully surrounded by love and with friends who told him how much we loved him and we made a promise that we would be there from the very beginning of this and he would never be on his own and he wasnapost - he slipped off very peacefully and we are so grateful for that. Philaposs friends organised a fundraiser after his death to cover funeral costs as the GoFundMe page states that he has no family left behind and they were able to reach their target after just one hour of the fundraising link being live - they intend to use the money to give him the send-off he truly deserved. Jackie added: We know there is messaging going out across Northern Ireland about AE or GPs being unable to see people but just keep pushing it and pushing it because there really is a lesson to be learnt here that you shouldnapost ignore your body and your health is just as important. He was just one of those very humble and quiet people who was larger than le in other ways. He was just an absolutely incredible human being that was so loved and weaposre just so sad heaposs not here.

Marshall Metcalfe, , died after suffering massive internal injuries after falling from a building on May , . Just a month later his mum Jane Ireland was found dead at the family home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. An inquest into both their deaths heard Marshall had suffered from schizophrenia and had retreated into himself after two spells in a mental health hospital. He had an extensive history with mental health, Senior Coroner Alan Wilson was told, which had began when he was  and would make himself sick over fears of gaining weight. Shortly before his death he was admitted to the The Cove - in-patient unit in Heysham run by Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust, and told a therapist there that he intended to take his own le.But his sister Holly Ireland told inquest that she told staff at The Cove she had concerns about Marshall being discharged into his mumaposs care as she had her own mental health issues, but claimed those pleas were ignored. Miss Ireland, , said her mumaposs mental health deteriorated after she lost part of her nose when her then-partner assaulted her in . I was there when it happened, Miss Ireland told the inquest. It had a massive impact on her. She just couldnapost get her head round why he did it to her. I begged her to move away but she began to distance herself from her friends and started to communicate with angels. She relied on his family when he was in prison for what he did to her. She had no nose, she had to go through so many operations, and she found it so hard just walking through the streets looking like that. During a four month stay at The Cove in May , Miss Ireland said he was simply drugged up and not given any therapy. He absolutely hated it in there, Miss Ireland said. There was only one person in there who could get down on his level. He shut himself off to everybody he was really poorly. I was constantly ringing The Cove but would a doctor speak to me  No. Miss Ireland said her worries about her mum were ignored before Marshall was discharged into her care. By Christmas  Marshall wasnapost there at all and his mum had begun to hear voices telling her to kill herself, Miss Ireland added. Mum was very good at hiding her illness but she was really unwell and she wasnapost getting any help, she said. At one point we were driving to somewhere for something to eat and she was just screaming and shouting in the back of the car. She said she was hearing voices telling her she was disgusting and she was screaming aposleave me aloneapos. In January  Marshall was admitted to hospital after he stopped eating and drinking. Miss Ireland said this was the worst she had seen her brother and said it was like he was not on this planet. In February  he was once more admitted to The Cove despite his familyaposs concerns that the unit had failed to help him in the past.  They just drugged him up, he didnapost have any therapy, but he was sectioned so it was like we didnapost have a voice, Miss Ireland said. I fought so hard to save them both but theyaposre not here anymore. The Cove turned him into a zombie. A post mortem revealed Marshall died as a result of a a number of injuries including broken ribs and signicant blood loss. Despite efforts to save him, Marshall was pronounced dead after reaching the hospital. One of Janeaposs friends, Russell Wilding, was with her shortly after she was informed Marshall had died. It was absolutely horrendous, Mr Wilding told the inquest. She was like a wounded animal. Iaposve never seen anyone in that much pain. In a statement, Janeaposs mum Patricia Ireland described her daughter as a talented make-up artist and reiki healer, as the apple of her father Benjaminaposs eye. She was so kind and generous and full of le, Mrs Ireland said. After Marshallaposs death the voices in Janeaposs head became meaner, Patricia said, and on June , one month after her son died, Jane was found dead in bed at her home. Mr Wilding, who discovered her body, said in a statement: I hadnapost been able to get hold of her so I went round. The front door was locked so I went round the back and the back door was wide open. That wasnapost unusual as she would often sit in the garden. But as I went up the stairs I started to feel that something was wrong. I miss Jane terribly she was a wonderful person. Post mortem toxicology tests revealed Miss Ireland had fatal levels of methadone in her system which caused her death. The inquest, which is due to last two weeks, continues on Tuesday.

Mr Perry was standing near the blast which happened seconds before the am minuteaposs Remembrance Day silence was about to begin. He is claimed to have suffered cuts, bruises and damage to his ear drum.Have you been affected by this story  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Mayor of Liverpool Joanne Anderson told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that David had erted a disaster with his heroic action.She said: The taxi driver with his heroic efforts has managed to ert what could’ve been an absolutely awful disaster at the hospital, our thanks go to him. Reports claim Mr Perryaposs male passenger had asked to go to the cityaposs Service of Remembrance before dying in the blast.  Following the explosion anti-terror police carried out several raids across Liverpool and three men - aged , , and  - were detained in the Kensington area of the city and arrested under the Terrorism Act in connection with the incident. A number of locals said armed officers swooped on a terraced house in the afternoon. Dozens of homes have also been evacuated in an operation that is still ongoing on Monday morning.  A source who is close to Mr Perryaposs family told MailOnline that his brave actions has potentially saved lives. They claimed Mr Perry - who has been described as an experienced cab driver - picked up the passenger who initially asked to be dropped off at Liverpoolaposs Anglican Cathedral which is half a mile from the hospital. A Remembrance Sunday parade had just ended and a memorial event featuring thousands of servicemen, veterans and dignitaries was being held at the church.  But the source claimed the route had to be changed due to road closures so the man asked to be dropped off at the centre centre before Mr Perry became suspicious as they drove past the hospital. They said Mr Perry noticed some kind of light attached to his clothing and the man was messing around with it which is when he jumped out of his car and locked the passenger in the back of the vehicle. They said: As soon as he did, itaposs gone off. Davidaposs the luckiest man in Britain as well as the most heroic,this guy got in the hospital God knows what could have happened. Counter-terrorism police said they continue to keep an open mind about the cause of the explosion and are working closely with Merseyside Police. A fundraiser which was set up to support Mr Perry and his family has raised more than £, in just a few hours.  Among those paying tribute to the hero cab driver was Billy Darwin.He posted on Facebook : “David nearly paid the ultimate price to save others apparently not giving anything a second thought besides making sure he went above and beyond to keep the people of Our City safe!”Kev Cuthbertson posted: “He is a hero, when he noticed the bomb, he locked the scumbag in the car. But took the brunt of the blast.”  Stephen Thomas wrote: “The driver is my mate, and spotted the passenger acting suspiciously, so he jumped out the car.” Another, George Cater, wrote: Please send your healing prayers to David Perry, the very brave taxi driver who is in a critical condition in hospital after preventing an attack at am this morning at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital. David stopped by the women’s hospital and locked the attacker in his cab after noticing the device.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it appears the taxi driver caught up in the Liverpool explosion acted with “incredible presence of mind and bravery”. He also tweeted on Sunday: My thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today.I want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation.  Earlier, a spokesman for Merseyside Police said: So far we understand that the car involved was a taxi which pulled up at the hospital shortly before the explosion occurred. We are keeping an open mind as to what caused the explosion, but given how it has happened - out of caution - counter terrorism police are leading the investigation supported by Merseyside Police. The Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, Serena Kennedy, has offered her reassurance over the incident.  She said: While I understand that todayaposs incident may cause concern in our communities, it should be pointed out that events of this nature are very rare. Merseyside Police will continue to liaise with community groups, community leaders, partner agencies and iniduals in the coming days and weeks to make sure any concerns are addressed and ensuring that we provide the best possible service to local people.  There will also be an increased and visible police presence on the streets of Merseyside and I would encourage people to engage with my officers and raise any concerns they may have.

Aspiring reality TV star Jimmy Featherstone, appeared at Hull Magistratesapos Court on Monday, charged with failing to comply with the requirements of a community order.Featherstone, , has been bound by two court orders made in relation to matters heard in court in May  and in April this year, reports Hull Live.He is known locally as an eccentric tanning addict and aspiring TV personality who claimed to have spent £, a year on his plastic surgery obsession, the site adds.  The court heard Featherstone had repeatedly breached his community order having been offered  office appointments by the probation service, only attending six. The defendant still had  days of uncompleted rehabilitation work when he came before the court on Monday accused of non-compliance with the community order. The court was told he had spoken to his designated offender manager in an aposunacceptable wayapos when he was questioned about his most recent absence at the start of this month.  Defence solicitor Mr Vining told the court in mitigation that Featherstone had told him he had dficulty remembering appointments and had bought himself a diary to assist with those problems. District Judge Passfield questioned the mitigation, asking Mr Vining: I would assume that he has a phone, does he not have one with a calendar  Featherstone accepted the charge of breaching the latest court order and Mr Vining admitted his client was absolutely terried of going to prison.  He said: He is intending to pursue a career in reality TV and says that he would be in a position to pay a financial penaltythe court was minded that would be sufficient. He is absolutely terried by the prospect of a prison sentence and feels that his appearance would leave him vulnerable while he is in custody. He tells me that he has been the victim of attacks in public in and around Hull city centre just for the way that he looks and with homophobic undertones.  However, District Judge Passfield said: Mr Featherstone, it is abundantly clear to me that you do not feel bound to the orders made by this court. You have shown a complete lack of respect after you were given a conditional discharge in May  which you have continued to breach on multiple occasions. Revisiting your sentencing, I am today giving you an eight week custodial sentence for both offences, you will serve these concurrently and will spend eight weeks in prison in total.

People reports that the hat was speculated by Elizabeth Holmes, author of HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style , to pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth, whose wide-brimmed hats are a staple of her wardrobe.Kate looked solemn as she stood in the middle with Camilla and Sophie at her sides on a balcony of the Foreign Office while Prince Charles, Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward were below as they laid wreaths at the Cenotaph. However, missing from the balcony was the Queen, who had sprained her back and was unable to attend the Remembrance Sunday service. In previous years, the Queen had stood on the balcony at the centre of Kate and Camilla. Buckingham Palace had said Her Majesty was disappointed to miss the event held annually at the Cenotaph on Whitehall.

The -year-old Syrian refugee’s murderous mission was thwarted by heroic cabbie David Perry, who is said to have locked him in the vehicle as he detonated his home-made device. It is also feared the type of bomb he used could indicate that an al-Qaeda cell was involved, as the country’s terror threat alert was raised from substantial to severe – meaning another attack is now “highly likely”. Al Swealmeen is believed to have had mental health problems and according to pals had been sectioned for brandishing a kne in the city centre before launching his death bid.  And it was tonight reported his intended Remembrance Day target was church-goers who helped him convert from Islam to Christianity. But police said he switched his deadly intentions to Liverpool Women’s Hospital after his route in a taxi was blocked by traffic and road closures and told David to head there. A senior former intelligence source said: “The bomber intended to enter the hospital and trigger his device, but for some reason it went off early and failed properly to initiate.  “Had he successfully set off the bomb inside it would have been extremely bloody and horric. “We believe this was a partial ­explosion, clearly from a device at high-chest level, aimed at causing many casualties.” Al Swealmeen, who died inside the burning cab, converted from Islam in Liverpool’s Anglican ­cathedral in March . He spent eight months living with devoted Christians Malcolm and ­Elizabeth ­Hitchcott at their home in the Aigburth district.  The couple today told of their shock at hearing the “quiet and well mannered” man, who was also quite artistic, allegedly intended to bomb women and children. Former soldier Mr Hitchcott­ said: “It’s terribly sad. We loved him. He was a lovely guy and we are shocked. “We are shocked because a less likely ­candidate you could not imagine.  “He first came to the ­cathedral in August  and wanted to convert to ­Christianity. He was ­destitute at that time and we took him in.” Mr and Mrs Hitchcott told how Al Swealmeen arrived in the UK via Dubai in  seeking asylum. It is believed his case had been decided and rejected at first. Motor racing fan Al Swealmeen, who is said to have called himself Enzo Almeni after Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari, then renewed his ­application in November .  But the couple said he never spoke about his time in Syria or Iraq. They said he was born in Iraq where his mum was from. His dad was Syrian. Armed police arrested three men in Kensington, a mile from the blast, on Sunday at .pm. They are aged ,  and . A fourth aged  was held today close to Sefton Park. ­Neighbours told of the drama as officers raided the property. One policeman could be seen with a gun on a ladder overlooking a garden behind the raided terraced house. There was a shout of “armed police” and another officer appears to break down the wooden fence or gate before storming the garden. A man in a white T-shirt looked through the back door, before ­disappearing. There were then shouts of “get out of the house, do not move, hands on your head now” as the man re-emerges and follows instructions to lie on the ground.  Resident Keith Ford, , said: “Police were everywhere. There were two officers with big guns, they looked like machine guns, pointed at the house. “One of them must have come to the door as I heard the policeman say to him, ‘Hands in the air’. “But he must have refused and gone back into the house because I then heard the policeman say, ‘He might have a gun in his pocket.’”  Matthew Heitman, , who lives opposite the raided house, added: “Two of the men were marched out at gunpoint and they had them up against the wall. There wasn’t any kind of struggle, they just walked out. “The people living there had not long moved in.” Jimmy Ashworth, , who runs Jimmy’s cafe was evacuated at am today as the further arrest took place.  He said: “They said that my le was in danger, that’s all they could tell me.” Photographs taken within the cordoned area at am showed a man in a black puffer jacket, black ­trousers and white trainers being held. One -year-old ­resident, who gave her name as Amy, said: “It’s unbelievable to think we were living  yards away from a bomb factory. I haven’t slept all night.”  Today Army specialists carried out a controlled explosion near Sefton Park “as part of the ongoing” probe into the blast, according to police. There have been warnings for weeks that terror groups are growing in Afghanistan following the bungled evacuation and could attack the West. The intelligence source added: “This is the attack we have been warning would take place.  “We are likely to see more in the coming months. Terrorists globally have been given confidence since the Afghan ­withdrawal and they have more space and time to devote to extending their violence worldwide.” Boris Johnson slammed the ­“sickening attack.” The PM said: “My thoughts remain with all those affected and I want to pay tribute to the emergency services who responded as always with such speed and professionalism.  “The British people will never be cowed by terrorism.” The Liverpool attack came just two weeks after Tory MP David Amess was stabbed to death at his surgery in an alleged terror incident. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the terror threat has been raised because “what we saw yesterday is the second incident in a month”.  NHS chiefs have ordered an overhaul of security at hospitals across England’s  health trusts. Cab driver David fled the vehicle after the explosion and just moments before it was engulfed in flames. He was treated in hospital.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Terror attacksTerrorismPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Emad Al Swealmeen, , died when an improvised explosive device went off in a taxi at just before am, police believe. He was named by the authorities on Monday - as it emerged he may have converted to Christianity after arriving in Britain. Reports claimed Al Swealmeen, a Syrian asylum seeker, also went by the name Enzo Almeni. It is claimed he suffered from mental health problems and had a previous conviction for carrying a kne - but was not known to MI.Do you know Emad Al Swealmeen  Email webnews@mirror.Searches are under way at addresses on Rutland Avenue and Sutclfe Street, where officers say Al Swealmeen previously lived at. Signicant items have been recovered, counter-terror police said.According to MailOnline, Al Swealmeen is believed to have spent a large part of his le in Iraq, where his mother came from.He then changed his name in honour of Ferrari founder Enzo Ferrari and to apossound less Muslimapos in a bid to help his asylum application. Malcolm Hitchcott told the website that he first met Al Swealmeen in , who later moved in with him and his we.  He said the suspect was confirmed as a Christian by at least March , adding that he was destitute at that time. The Mail adds that he wanted to attack Liverpoolaposs Anglican Cathedral where hundreds had gathered to attend a Remembrance Day service. He first came to the cathedral in August  and wanted to convert to Christianity, Mr Hitchcott told the Mail. He took an Alpha course, which explains the Christian faith, and completed it in November of that year. That enabled him to come to an informed decision. But police said Al Swealmeen switched his deadly intentions to Liverpool Women’s Hospital after his route in a taxi was blocked by traffic and road closures - and told the driver to head there.  A senior former intelligence source said: “The bomber intended to enter the hospital and trigger his device, but for some reason it went off early and failed properly to initiate. “Had he successfully set off the bomb inside it would have been extremely bloody and horric. “We believe this was a partial ­explosion, clearly from a device at high-chest level, aimed at causing many casualties.” Naming the suspect this evening Det Chf Insp Andrew Meeks, from Counter-Terrorism Policing North West, said: aposaposOur enquiries are very much ongoing but at this stage we strongly believe that the deceased is  year old Emad Al Swealmeen. Al Swealmeen is connected to both the Rutland Avenue and Sutclfe Street addresses where searches are still ongoing. We believe he lived at the Sutclfe Street address for some time and had recently rented the Rutland Avenue address. Our focus is the Rutland Avenue address where we have continued to recover signicant items.  We continue to appeal for any information about this incident and now that we have released his name any information that the public may have about Al Swealmeen no matter how small may be of great assistance to us.aposapos So far four men have been arrested under terrorism laws in the Kensington area of Liverpool in connection with the attack. Three suspects aged ,  and , who were held on Sunday, and a man aged , who was detained a day later. A controlled explosion was also carried out on Monday in Sefton Park as a precaution as part of the investigation, police said. The blast outside of Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital has been declared a terrorist attack by authorities, who say they are yet to establish a motive. The UKaposs threat level has been raised to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. Speaking at a press conference at Downing Street, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the blast was a stark reminder to the public to remain vigilant, adding: What yesterday showed above all is that the British people will never be cowed by terrorism, we will never give in to those who seek to ide us with senseless acts of violence.

Her Majesty is continuing to rest at Windsor Castle after she was forced to pull out of attending the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. Buckingham Palace moved to dampen fears over her condition after announcing the -year-old had suffered an “unfortunate” back strain, which left her “deeply disappointed” to miss the event. Courtiers are now understood to now be taking a “cautious approach” with the sovereign’s diary moving forward, with no public engagements expected for the rest of the year. Insiders with knowledge of the conversations said there should be a “realistic expectation” that the Queen’s diary will be dramatically reduced throughout the winter months. Any rearranging could open up the possibility of asking any one of the seven senior royals to step in and take on extra roles or engagements. Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Anne and Prince Edward and his we Sophie are all understood to be aligned on helping out “for as long as is needed”.  Courtiers have said this “joined up approach” will take on “extra signicance” in the Queen’s absence leading up to her Platinum Jubilee next year. Somewhat tongue in cheek, palace officials have dubbed them the “Magnicent Seven” when referring to the group. Palace officials have insisted the Queen has “no intention of stepping back” from royal duties but realises she will undertake less duties in the future.  The Queen has been on doctors’ orders to rest for nearly a month after being admitted to hospital for preliminary investigations - her first overnight stay in a medical facility in eight years - on October .One royal source said: “The Queen remains as sharp as a pin, but the reality is she needs to take a period of rest following an extremely busy start to normal duties after the coronavirus -gtcoronavirus restrictions were lted.“The senior members of the family are all aligned in that they will be available to help out wherever they can and for as long as is needed.”Earlier this year after the furore over Prince Harry and his we Meghan’s split from The Firm the Queen vowed a “new beginning” for the royals after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex chose mega-money deals over duty.At the time Her Majesty, , gave the go-ahead for the seven senior royals to take up public engagements as soon as possible. The Prince of Wales, Duke of Cambridge and Princess Royal have in recent times taken on investitures on behalf of the Queen, handing out gongs at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.  Apart from awarding fundraising and war veteran hero Sir Captain Tom Moore his knighthood last summer at Windsor Castle, the Queen’s last investiture was at Buckingham Palace in November , when she awarded honours to more than  people. A palace spokesman said the Queen would continue to undertake “light duties” while recovering from her bad back and is due to carry out virtual audiences in a few days’ time. The Queen also has cancelled a scheduled appearance on Tuesday at the General Synod - the first time the Queen, who is Supreme Governor of the Church of England, has missed her five-yearly visit to the Church’s national assembly in its -year history. As she continues to take it easy this week, the coming weekend marks a dficult milestone for the Queen. Saturday would have been the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh’s th wedding anniversary - and it will be the first anniversary of their marriage to pass since Philip died in April at the age of . A source said: “The Queen has been and continues to be hugely comforted by many of her family rallying round this year and will no doubt be looking forward to being together for Christmas this year.”Charles and Camilla’s Middle East tour Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall will kick off their tour of Jordan and Egypt on Tuesday. It will be the first overseas visit by a senior royal family member since the pandemic began. They will arrive in Jordan’s capital Amman and meet King Abdullah II and Queen Rania to mark the country’s centenary and its relationship with Britain.  Charles, , will highlight the nation’s role in sheltering , Syrian refugees and two million Palestinians. Camilla is to learn about the work of Queen Rania in helping the vulnerable and take part in a Women of the World event. The tour coincides with the end of Britain’s hosting of COP and Egypt’s nomination to stage the UN climate summit next year. The royals will meet President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Grand Imam of Egypt’s al-Azhar and also celebrate Britain’s links with the country. A reception will be staged overlooking the pyramids at the Giza Plateau. The royal couple will also tour the ancient city of Alexandria. They are to have talks about religious tolerance and the role of faith in environmental issues.

They are the kind of people for whom numbers, and not humanity, remain the bottom line. Foden is the headteacher who ordered the cook at his school in Gwynedd, North Wales, not to feed kidstheir meal accounts are even p in arrears.“The school has been instructed not to give food to any child from November their debt has not been cleared, or, in the future, to children whose accounts do not have enough money to pay for lunch,” read a letter to parents.Their debt  They are children, for goodness’ sake. Debt shouldn’t be a word they even know in a school context.In any case, how on earth can you be a teacher and not believe kids have a basic right to eat Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section With suggestions that some staff were storing food in their classrooms for hungry kids, it appears not all of Foden’s colleagues were on board.Before his school’s board u-turn and apology this afternoon, Foden had sought to defend his ­Dickensian approach, maintaining he’d taken action because “a handful of pupils had run up debts totalling more than £,”. “We’re not talking about cracking down excessively harshly on a handful of parents who’ve run up debts of a fiver or so,” he said.Trouble is, it didn’t take long for reporters to find one parent who’d been contacted by the local authority after being overdrawn to the tune of just p. Doubtless there’ll be others. Why not just send a letter out to families to distinguish between those dragging their heels and those who really are on hard times  Why not then point those in need towards the ways to apply for emergency school meals in Wales  You’d like to think Foden is more embarrassed by his ruthless words in the cold light of day than the ferocious social media backlash towards his leaked letter.He should certainly be ashamed that a blogger, Simon Harris of the Men Behaving Dadly podcast, even offered to pay the £, – even though he doesn’t have a child there.Either way, maybe it is Foden who qualies for an early visit from the Ghost of Christmas Past.

So far it has been an unseasonably mild November where people have been able to bask in outbreaks of sunshine around the country and little will change over the coming days. But by the end of next weekend the temperatures will start to fall as freezing Arctic winds take a grip bringing sub-zero temperatures. WXCharts show the mercury could drop as low as -C to -C during the week of November  with the frostiest conditions in the far north of Scotland. Scotland is likely to see snowfall from Sunday, the agency predicted.  Snow is expected to start from November  in the Grampians and the Highlands before moving down the country over the coming days and by the end of the month it is likely to cover parts of northern England and North Wales. There is a chance that as far south as Brighton could have sub zero temperatures by November  according to the weather maps. Then from then onwards there is a risk of snow and ice across the country.Oliver Claydon, Met Office, told the Express : “Long-lead models are showing there is a chance for things to turn a bit colder in the middle of next week.“Uncertainty is hinged around an area of high pressure,it’s further to the west then it could pull a chance of snow from the north. Snow is likely to continue after next week and temperatures will get colder as the month goes on.James Madden, forecaster for Exact Weather, told the Express : “The cold is likely to win out before the end of November bringing an early taste of winter and the risk of snow.“Waning solar activity means chances are high for a aposlittle ice ageapos winter this year with notable periods of cold and snow. “We have high confidence for the most cold and wintry conditions since December  developing towards the end of the year. That could bring extreme cold temperatures and spells of widespread snow, he added.Met Office five-day weather forecast Tuesday Mostly cloudy start across England and Wales with possible drizzle, and patchy thick fog in the east and south. Sunnier breaks further north and west, before Scotland and Northern Ireland see rain followed by blustery, heavy showers. Windy and colder. Tuesday night Weakening rain band crossing southern UK followed by clearer conditions. Further north, blustery showers, some heavy, especially for northern and western Scotland, wintry on higher hills. Windy and chilly here. Wednesday Showers in northern and western areas will slowly ease, although replaced by evening rain in northwest UK. Further south, a mainly dry day with sunny spells. Somewhat cooler and breezier. Thursday to Saturday Most regions dry and very mild with iable, often large amounts of cloud. Rain across the far northwest sinking further south on Saturday and turning colder from the north.

However, it reappeared in October has become really bad. She said: There is loads and loads of mould. It is like big, black mould. It is in my bedroom, all over my bedroom walls and the window sill, all over the windows, the ceiling and the floor. It got into my chest of drawers so I had to throw them away. It is in my kitchen, above my window. I suffer with severe depression. I cannot have my friends and my family around because I am embarrassed - I am currently living in my living room.  It is embarrassing and it is making my depression worse. Miss Simcox currently doesnapost have much of a choice in trying to leave due to her financial situation, and is currently on careraposs allowance and universal credit. It is making my le a misery, I am trapped, she said. Because I am on benefits, and I donapost get a lot, it isnapost like I can find myself somewhere new. I donapost want to be there anymore. Theyhavenapost helped me.  I just want to move. But I donapost want this to happen to anyone  because it isnapost right. It is like they donapost want to help. The council have told her the reason for the mould is caused by her not opening her windows, Miss Simcox claims. But she says she is reluctant to open the windows as there are bins directly outside which then cause the inside of the home to smell. My housing officer said it is due to not having the windows open, she told Birmingham Live. But I canapost open the windows because there are bins literally right outside my bedroom window. It doesnapost smell too good. In response to the story, a spokesperson for Trident Group said: We take the health and wellbeing of all our residents seriously and all our properties, prior to being let, are inspected by the organisation and a third party. We will investigate all concerns raised and work with residents to resolving any issues arising as soon as possible.

And you can trust me: I’ve done both. Shts at McDonald’s are far from a golden time. Spent running around, never sitting down, under constant pressure to deliver meals within the magic -second window, all the time fixing a smile on your face and saying hurried, robotic company mantras: “Enjoy your meal!” Sounds exhausting  It is. Not to mention the frequent abuse, bad-mouthing and often flat-out lies from customers angling for a free Big Mac .  I would get home and quite literally collapse to the floor. Then I would have to get up again because there was housework, A-level coursework, or revision to do. Flash forward a year, and Iaposd just arrived at the University of Cambridge. I come from a low-income, single-parent household from the back of beyond in Shropshire. I was excited, nervous, and finally free. But I was not prepared for the culture shock I was about to experience.  The majority of my new friends were privately educated. Some of them had never had a job at all, let alone a customer service job. As term began, I became increasingly incredulous as I had to advise some of myfriends on everything from how to use a scourer, to how to wash up and cook pasta. And break the news that no, you can’t just add tomato purée to plain pasta and expect it to turn into the delicious vegetable sauce your mother makes. I went from flipping burgers and swearing as the milkshake machine broke again , to attending fancy formals with menus where I barely understood half the words on the page.Cambridge was tough. The workload was overwhelming and, at times, it felt like I was drowning in deadlines. If you turn up to McDonald’s at nine in the morning, or more often, six, there’s no-one interrogating your most recent essay on the philosophical value of th century French literature, asking you questions until you can’t string two words together anymore. But for all its reputation, Cambridge is the very definition of work hard, play hard. I would study for eight hours every day and despair that no matter how much time I spent, it was never enough. But then there were the formals, the balls, the nights out with friends that made it all worth it. My college became my family, and its people my community. McDonald’s is tougher than an Oxbridge degree. It is bone-wearying, relentless, and without any of the fun. But it also taught me to be grateful for every penny I have, and to appreciate the degree that enables me to do what I love. And no Oxbridge degree could have taught me that.

Dontae Sharpe was granted a full pardon by North Caroline Governor Roy Copper, on Friday after decades fighting for his freedom.Sharpe, an African American, was just -years-old when he was sentenced in  for murdering George Radclfe, , during a drug deal.He was convicted based on the evidence given by Charlene Johnson, who was then -year-old and claimed to have seen Sharpe kill Radclfe and described it in detail. However, Johnson recanted her testimony two weeks later and after decades of trying to get his sentence overturned, two evidential hearings in  destroyed the case against Sharpe.  Not only had Johnson withdraw her initial testimony,tried again she would testy that she was not present at the time of the shooting and that her trial testimony was entirely made up based on what she saw on television and what investigators told her. In addition to that, the medical examiner of the trial, Dr Mary Gilliand only learned of Johnsonaposs  testimony well after the trial was over andcalled to a retrial would testy that Johnsonaposs initial description of the shooting was medically and scientically impossible. Sharpe is now eligible to apply for compensation of up to ,after losing decades of his le, , for each year of wrongful imprisonment. Speaking about the case, Cooper said: I have carefully reviewed Dontae Sharpeaposs case and am granting him a Pardon of Innocence. Mr Sharpe and others who have been wrongly convicted deserve to have that injustice fully and publicly acknowledged. Throughout his sentence, Sharpe maintained his innocence and refused to take a lighter sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. After being declared innocent, Sharpe said: Iaposm still in a haze, kind of. When youaposre dealing with us human beings, it can go any way, yes and no. I didnapost know what to expect. I was believing for a pardon. My familyaposs name has been cleared. Itaposs a burden off of my shoulders and my familyaposs shoulders.  Sharpe continues his fight to help others who have been convicted wrongfully.

It was supposed to be six feet tall with Father Christmas carrying a ladder and a working train. But we got a six-inch tree which was basically a twig with a couple of baubles, a bit of string and a Father Christmas with a deformed face. It looked like the paint had been chucked on. I ordered a charger for my phone that arrived the same day as the tree and the charger came in a bigger box than the tree. We were crying with laughter. It was so funny.  Sam and her mum, Karen, had ordered the tree from online shop Wulimer after seeing it had been reduced from £ to £. The Wulimer website, which appears to have dropped the price of the ft tree even further to £. while claiming they have aposlimited stockapos, bragged that it was handmade and aposuniqueapos.

The Russian test carried out on Monday generated a debris field in low-Earth orbit that endangered the station and will pose a hazard to space activities for years, say US officials. The direct-ascent anti-satellite missile fired by Russia into one of its own satellites generated more than , pieces of trackable orbital debris and would likely spawn hundreds of thousands of smaller fragments, the US Space Command said in a statement. Russia has demonstrated a deliberate disregard for the security, safety, stability and long-term sustainability of the space domain for all nations, space command chief US Army General James Dickinson said. The debris from the missile test will continue to pose a threat to activities in outer space for years to come, putting satellites and space missions at risk, as well as forcing more collision avoidance manoeuvres, he said.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned the missile test as reckless and irresponsible. The seven-member space station crew - four US astronauts, a German astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts - were told to take shelter in their docked spaceship capsules for two hours after the test as a precaution, NASA said. The research lab, orbiting about  miles above Earth, continued to pass through or near the debris cluster every  minutes, but NASA specialists determined it was safe for the crew toto the stationaposs interior after the third pass, the agency said. The crew was also ordered to seal off hatches to several modules of the International Space Stationfor the time being, according to NASA. NASA will continue monitoring the debris in the coming days and beyond to ensure the safety of our crew in orbit, NASA chief Bill Nelson said in the statement. Experts said the testing of weapons that shatter satellites in orbit pose a space hazard by creating clouds of fragments that can collide with other objects, setting off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit.A message posted on Twitter by the Russian space agency Roscosmos downplayed the danger.The orbit of the object, which forced the crew today to move into spacecraft according to standard procedures, has moved away from the ISS orbit, Roscosmos tweeted. The station is in the green zone. At the Pentagon, spokesman John Kirby said the test showed the need to firmly establish norms of behaviour in space. It is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts, Nelson said.  He said the cloud of debris also posed a threat to a separate Chinese space station under construction and the three-member crew of taikonauts aboard that outpost. In April Russia carried out another test of an anti-satellite missile as officials have said that space will increasingly become an important domain for warfare. In , India shot down one of its own satellites in low-Earth orbit with a ground-to-space missile.These tests have raised questions about the long-term sustainability of space operations essential to a huge range of commercial activities, from telecommunications and weather forecasting to banking and GPS services.Comment MORE ON NasaInternational Space StationU.S. Space Command\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

North Korean state media released images of the smiling leader wearing a leather jacket as he inspected sites in Samjiyon.Over the past year Kimaposs public appearances have been few and spread out which have fuelled the talk that he is not well, reported the Daily Star. He was previously seen on October  as he inspected a missile exhibition in Pyongyang, reported state media. Kimaposs family has a history of heart disease and there have been rumours over the years of him having a cardiovascular condition.  But the new images released, give the impression of Kim looking well and full of smiles for the public engagement. The North Korean leader was in Samjiyon to see for his own eyes the third phase of a construction project in the city, said state media. The report says Kim wants to transform Samjiyon into a great standard and ideal model local city.Kimaposs absence from the North Korean media spotlight is reportedly his longest during his time in leadership since , according to the Independent.But North Korean authorities have explained his lack of attendance at public events is down to him working on other important state issues behind the scenes.  All the same there are plenty of questions why the -year-old has taken eight breaks away from public activity, with in the past he has been more regularly photographed at events. Meanwhile the North Korean authorities continue their fighting talk and recently held an artillery shell fire tests designed to annihilate the enemy. The state media reported that the drills come at a time when the enthusiasm to undergo intensive training prevails throughout the Korean Peopleaposs Armyfor ushering in a new heyday in strengthening the state defence capabilities under the banner of self-defence. General Rim Kwang Il, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, and commanders of the participating units watched the drills, but Kim was absent from the event.

The milestone marks the British jab’s global takeover using a pioneering approach that meant it was rapidly produced in poorer countries around the world. Only China’s Sinovac vaccine has been administered into more arms globally, due mainly to it being the number one vaccine for the country’s . billion population. Oxford’s AstraZeneca jab has been the main Covid- leline for Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, much of the Middle East, South and Central America, as well as in Australia and Britain. Scientists insisted the vaccine be sold without profit and quickly set up a McDonald’s-style franchise system to establish low-tech manufacturing labs in  countries.  The discovery was made by a team led by Dr Sandy Douglas and they recently received a Special Recognition gong at the Mirror’s Pride of Britain Awards. Dr Douglas told the Mirror that from the start they were adamant that theirs would be the “vaccine for the world”. He said: “We looked around the world and knew a bit of the history of what had happened with access to vaccines in previous pandemics, which is that countries have fought with each other for access. “We anticipated the less well off countries might well be left behind and we thought that tackling that was really high priority from the start. “There were two things that we were pushing for when we were trying to choose the right [pharmaceutical] partner. “One of them was the not-for-profit aspect. The other was the question of where the vaccine was going to be made because we were worried that possession was going to be nine tenths of the law.”  Oxford academics approached factory owners with suitable sites around the world and persuaded them to start preparing to make the vaccine, even before it had been given to the first volunteer in the clinical trial. These manufacturing sites, including in India and South America, have meant rich nations could not monopolise supplies of their jab. The key mass production technology that meant the Oxford jab could be made and stored in existing labs was confirmed in a breakthrough on January . A vaccine - in the form of an inactivated form of the virus - has to grow within cells. The Oxford team found a specic mix of nutrients that could be ‘fed’ to the cells to keep them healthy. It allows many more doses to be made in each batch and, crucially, avoids the need for complex equipment to keep the cells healthy, required for other vaccines. The combination of new tech and the franchise model meant that as well as being the UK’s workhorse vaccine - inoculating Brits quicker than almost all other comparable nations - the Oxford jab has been able to protect more of the world’s poorest communities against the ravages of the pandemic. It is now used in  countries, by for the most. It was the main vaccine able to get through in signicant quantities to conflict-torn parts of the world such as Syria and Iraq. After the Oxford jab, Pfizer have produced most of their jab. However these doses have gone almost exclusively to the US, Europe and Israel. The Oxford jab is the only vaccine that is committed to be sold without profit to all countries during the pandemic, and without profit to poorer countries forever. Sir John Bell, of the UK Vaccine Taskforce and Oxford University, said: “Manufacturing may not be seen as glamorous but the number of doses made, and where they are made, determines how much impact a vaccine can have in the real world. “Millions of people around the world owe their lives to the two billion doses produced as a result of this collaboration between our researchers and AstraZeneca.” Comment MORE ON AstraZeneca plcPfizer Inc.Middle EastOxford UniversityJohn BellEducationCoronavirus vaccineCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But his musical taste was very dferent to mine, although I did once manage to get him to sing along to Block Buster by the Sweet.My father died in August , just a week before I started high school at Preston Lodge. Irsquod just turned  years old. Soon afterwards, I remember going into his study, which had previously been out of bounds, and sitting in his chair, surrounded by his books, writing materials and music tapes.These were the days when combined radio and tape recorders were popular. His music tapes were in a special box, all titled in his handwriting. Hersquod recorded the music from the radio so the quality wasnrsquot brilliant.There were moments on the tapes when hersquod not switched it off quickly enough, so hersquod caught snippets of the presenter talking, and sometimes the tape had run out before the tune ended.But all this just made the tape collection a more powerful personal connection to my dad who Irsquod recently lost. So, while he had been unable to interest me in classical music while he was alive, I began to listen to his collection after his death. I would recognise tunes and was now able to put a name to them thanks to the titles hersquod written on the tapes.They conjured up memories for me. One was of a rainy Saturday afternoon in which my father invited me to join him in being the conductor for a Mozart tune. So he showed me how to conduct, leading and living the music with our arm movements. We had fun together doing this for what seemed like an hour or so in our small kitchen, as he explained the dferent instruments involved and how they merge together, and the role of the conductor. It was, in truth, a rare moment, but perhaps thatrsquos why I remembered it so vividly.It was the same Mozart tune that played on my car radio last week. It conjured another memory: of me standing in the kitchen being the conductor to the tune, alone, in the weeks after my fatherrsquos death. Irsquod found the tape and recognised the tune. I then learnt every pause, listened to the instruments and conducted to the music as my father had taught me.I didnrsquot understand it at the time, nobody spoke to me about it, but I now realise that I was in deep grief.My conducting the music was an expression of my loss, but I had nobody to talk to about it or process it I couldnrsquot allow the emotions to surface: ldquoBe strong, now you are the man of the family, boys donrsquot cry, they get on with it.My mother was stunned and closed down as well. I somehow learnt that tears, crying and being upset was something to avoid. So I buried my grief.So I did as advised, I got on with it. Irsquove done OK, I think, for I suppose when we walk with a stone in our shoe long enough we get used to it, and after a while stop noticing it. But, of course, it is still there, and only when we take our shoe off and finally find a way to remove the stone do we feel the dference and understand the effect itrsquos had on our walking.Last week was that moment for me: sitting in my car, overwhelmed with emotion from  years ago, remembering myself as a -year-old boy who felt he was unable to talk about what was then the greatest loss in his le.Irsquom a father myself now, of course, and thank goodness times have changed.There is a greater recognition these days of the need to talk, to express emotions and process feelings that our mental health is as important as our physical health, although words are often not matched with resources.But within our families also, we all need safe spaces to feel upset, let emotions surface and receive support from love ones. And that includes recognising our own mental health needs.I know most of us already know the importance of this. I certainly know it, yet despite this, I still tend to ignore the signs Irsquom struggling until my mental health is in tatters, which helps nobody.Just now my kids are having their own challenges, as so many are, and my own emotions have surfaced in my attempts to give support. The temptation was to quickly re-bury my emotions so I could concentrate on giving that support and also not let anyone down that voice is still in my head: ldquoGet on with it, man up.But that Mozart tune stopped me doing this. It made me connect with how I felt. It helped me understand why the adults close to me, when I was that -year-old boy, didnrsquot ask me how I was feeling or give me space and time to talk about my emotions and express my loss they couldnrsquot because they hadnrsquot allowed it for themselves.Mozart that day gave me the gt of self-care, which has helped me be more effective in caring and supporting loved ones, and ing at well at work.Itrsquos never easy to write about a personal vulnerability there is still that fear of ridicule. I had actually planned to write a historical tale this week, but events, and emotions, took over. There is always next time.Remembrance Day is this week, a time when we collectively pause to remember people we have lost in wars. Veterans know all about long-lasting trauma and loss, and the importance of acknowledging unseen emotional wounds.These issues can affect us all in dferent ways at dferent times. We rarely know the struggles that others are experiencing. Being kind to others includes being kind to yourself."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-360-centre-former-cockenzie-power-station-site","story":"Councillors are to be asked to approve funding for a feasibility study into the development of the proposed  Centre, a community-led initiative to create a nationally important climate change centre.The  Centre is intended to be a major attraction for East Lothian, with proposals for a signicant art installation alongside a visitor centre, education and training facilities, as well as the potential to run ferry buses along the coast and marine trips from the adjacent pier.So far, the vacant former power station site, owned by East Lothian Council, has seen planning permission granted for offshore wind farm substations.The  Centre proposal is a community-led initiative which took shape last year and has since garnered pledges of support from residents, academic researchers and renewable energy developers.An online public launch event was conducted in April to gather community views, which have been incorporated into a draft vision document.The group behind the proposed plans will continue to seek community guidance and views through a series of events and an online survey.Anna Scott, a representative from the  Centre community group, said: ldquoWe are thrilled that East Lothian Council is engaging so constructively with our proposals and are hopeful that funding for a feasibility study will be approved.ldquoThe  Centre is an ambitious project, but why should we not be ambitious for the future of our local community ldquoAs a young person growing up in this coastal community, doing something positive to address the climate crisis just feels so important, not just for the future of our area but far beyond that.ldquoThe Cockenzie site is a site of hope ndash built on coal mines which stretch out under the Forth and the site of a former coal-fired power station which can now be reimagined to tell the story of climate change and even host research into solutions.ldquoThe  Centre would include iconic new sculptures and improve access to the site and the coastal pathway, which is of course named after the East Lothian-born environmentalist John Muir.ldquoOver  years ago, John Muir was creating national parks in America and inspiring others to value the earth and the nature around us.

I never imagined it would take off the way it has. We have gone on to become a registered charity and have seen , people have come through the door of our centre, the Kaleidoscope which we opened in . We now support more than  families.ldquoWe run drop-in sessions, support groups for parents, and teens and adults with autism and have our family days at the weekends. We just allow the families and the children to be themselves. They donrsquot have to hide or feel they are being judged. Our centre is their safe place.One of the areas which children enjoy most is Autism Rocks sensory garden. It is a calm and relaxing place where the youngsters can sit and listen to sounds and be soothed by sensory lights.A light and sound arch in the garden projects rainbows on to an area which children love to sit and watch. However, it has been damaged to the elements and over-hanging trees but is a vital piece of sensory equipment the charity would like to replace and can cost in the region of pound,.Ms Quin added: ldquoAll the children who come to us just love to spend time in the garden. It is a place which is very tactile so that they can feel and touch dferent plants and objects. For a child with autism our sensory arch can be a way to relax and calm them and any funds we receive from the Gannett Foundation would go towards that.ldquoWe are a charity which is non-profit and we donrsquot qualy for certain funding pots. When we were told about the Gannett Foundation nomination, I think we were just overwhelmed and it was a massive boost. It had been a very dficult time for us having to close the centre in lockdown and we were delighted when we were able to welcome people back in June of this year.ldquoHowever, just knowing that someone had thought of us and recognised the importance of our work as the Gannett Foundation has really brought a smile to our faces.Throughout November we are running tokens every day in The Herald and we asked YOU to decide where this money should be spent.Now we are putting the power to allocate the cash back into the hands of our readers ndash during November, you are invited to collect tokens from our newspapers which can then be sent to collection points across our region or posted.

Younger siblings wore hand-me-down clothes that their elders had grown out of. Shopping was done on foot on a pretty much daily basis at a range of small outlets in onersquos own district. Girls were to taught to darn socks and to patch and mend. We knitted to acquire otherwise expensive pullovers, and made rugs from kits at home. At least we had a coal fire to keep us warm, evenintermittent power cuts sometimes kept us in the dark.This is what reducing demand on resources means: going without, settling for something lesser than we want, making do and mending. Reduced to our -minute neighbourhoods, restricted by the limits of public transport, our horizons will shrink, cultural le will stagnate, choices will be strictly circumscribed. This is what austerity is. This is very much the Greensrsquo prospectus, and it appears to be that being embraced also by the SNP.What the young, whose demand for new clothes, accessories and gadgets is limitless, will make of it remains to be seen. But I suspect that, after demonstrating in favour of climate change measures, when faced with austerity in reality a number of them will say, in shocked tones: \"But we didnrsquot mean it to be like this\".Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.WE HAVE TO FIGHT INEQUALITYTHE COP Glasgow climate negotiationsrsquo tone was set by the UK Government, among those still failing to keep even the inadequate pledges made at Paris six years ago, like  billion a year from developed to developing countries to cope with the effects of climate change and afford green energy technologies. Experts say they need more like  trillion annually.The half-baked legal requirement on UK companies to make plans on how they would progress towards net zero showed a lack of serious intent. There are no dates by which they have to have reduced their net emissions by % or half or to zero. The belief that the market will sort it itself is wishful thinking.China, Russia and Indiarsquos governments certainly disappoint too. But the UK, US and most other developed-country governments have not only failed to provide the foreign aid levels required, but continue to use fossil fuels themselves. More than % of all US energy and % of total UK energy comes from fossil fuels. President Biden also refused to sign up to phasing out coal to avoid losing votes in mining state.If developed countries, who could afford the transition, havenrsquot got close yet, low and middle-income countries, where many people are a dayrsquos earnings away from starving, need more support from richer countries to do it. And no government will survive in power longthe electricity supply is cut off too often.The UK Governments welfare ldquoreforms targeting the disabled, those on low incomes, and other vulnerable groups and unwillingness to fund insulation of existing housing, also undermine public support for green reforms among low and middle income earners. As did David Cameronrsquos scrapping of supposedly ldquogreen levies on fuel bills which were mostly actually subsidising energy bills for the poorest.Itrsquos neither realistic nor fair to expect anyone to vote to make their family or population cold, hungry or homeless today for the good of all in the long run. Reducing inequality within and between countries is the only way to get majority support for the changes that are needed.Duncan McFarlane, Carluke.DO POLITICIANS DO ENOUGH THERE is another way of looking at the situation where our representatives such as Douglas Ross have multiple jobs . Personally, I have always found it dficult to be in two places at the one time. If Mr Ross can fulfil the roles of MP and MSP simultaneously and have time to run up and down the sidelines with a flag it would suggest to me that none of the jobs can be particularly onerous.If we are led to believe that elected representatives with multiple jobs can do so at no detriment to the interests of their constituents, one has to ask how those with just the one job pass the time of day  Do they just sit about twiddling their thumbs  Is being an MSP, even one who couldnrsquot convince a constituency to vote for them and gets parachuted into Holyrood as a list MSP, simply a part-time job  If that is the case, why does each MSP need an annual budget of pound, to employ support staff  Why can MPs claim pound, each year for support staffmany of them are in effect part-time MPs  I wonderMr Ross is entitled to claim support for both jobs Thatrsquos a big bag of worms to delve into but it is a pointless, futile exercise as despite the fact the we pay their wages the general public is powerless to control either Westminster or Holyrood.

He concludes with this phrase: \"As I say: the political landscape may be changing but not in Scotland and that has consequences for everyone who wants to get rid of the Tories.\"Could anything encapsulate better than Mr Smiths words the democratic deficit in Scotland and the arrogance of the Tory Party throughout the UK  Allow me to rephrase his conclusion in another way: eventhe Tory vote in Scotland never gets above % youre going to get Tory governments.

And Holyrood achieved this with a limited budget and severely circumscribed borrowing ability. I leave Unionists to draw their own conclusions.Larry Cheyne, Bishopbriggs.REVIVE GLASGOW CROSSRAIL PLANREADING Catriona Stewarts piece on plans for transport in Glasgowreminded me of the issue of travelling between Central and Queen Street railway stations.Some years ago the late Roderick McDougall and Ken Sutherland showed how a Crossrail could be constructed with just . miles of track and a station at Glasgow Cross no expensive tunnels under the Clyde required.Passengers whose final destination was Glasgow would still use Queen Street or Central, but those requiring to travel on to the other network, such as from Edinburgh to Ayrshire, or Dumfries to Fe, would change trains at Glasgow Cross instead, without the long trek or bus ride through the traffic presently required.So far, the powers that be have proved deaf to this straightforward measure which would make rail travel more attractive and thus reduce car use. With the pressing need to make travel more sustainable I hope they will change their minds.In the meantime, is it too much to ask for a safe cycle route between the two stations to be identied Jane Ann Liston, St Andrews.Read more: Now the hard work really begins"},{"url":null,"title":"che-adams-incredible-journey-euros-world-cup-qualifiers-scotland","story":"Asked to sum it up, he couldnrsquot.

for the creditors and would ask interested parties to contact our Glasgow office as soon as possible.Director Gordon McArthur who announced the loss in August believed then that actions taken would

over  years, the accounts for the year ended May ,  are disappointing to all stakeholders in the business.\"He said many many factors had contributed to the \"signicant loss\" including a \"rapid fall in turnover, Covid pandemic, weakness in key appointments andprofitablity on key contracts delivered over an -month period\".He added in an August commentary: \"Management have taken strong actions tothe company to its historical financial strength.\"Among the actions were cuts of pound.m through \"headcount reduction\" and overheads control.\"The Covid- pandemic has added to the challenge within the business and the industry,\" said Mr McArthur. \"Awarding of contracts has been slower than typical, material shortages, volatility in key material pricing and productivity due to safe distancing are all challenging contract profitabiity. \"However the measures introduced subsequent to this accounting period are enabling the leadership team to make commercial and profitable

The gun will be taken out of storage where it has been for some time and carried to Kirkwall for an onward journey for conservation work by JPS Restoration, specialist large industrial conservators based in Alloa. The gun willto the county in the run up to Christmas to take up position inside the new Museum extension.The heavy lting and relocation work is being carried out by local firms Orkney Builders Contractors Ltd. and Heddle Construction Ltd., as part of the contract to refurbish the Museum’s Pumphouse and build the new extension.The guns from SMS Bremse and SMS Karlsruhe are both cm SK L – both these vessels were interned  with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow in , and scuttled by their own crews on  June . Bremse was salvaged by Ernest Cox ten years later, but Karlsruhe remains on the sea bed and is a popular site for recreational ers.SMS Bremse was a minelaying light cruiser launched in  in Stettin. She spent the war operating in the North Sea, taking part in a raid on British convoy to Norway in  which resulted in the sinking of two Royal Navy destroyers and nine merchant ships.SMS Karlsruhe was a light cruiser, launched in  in Kiel and named after the Imperial German Navy’s famous raiding cruiser which was lost in the Caribbean at the start of the First World War. She saw service in the North Sea and the Baltic. The gun from this vessel in the Museum’s collection is missing its gun shield.HMS Hampshire struck a German mine off Marwick Head in heavy weather on the evening of June , , and sank within  minutes. All but  men of over  on board perished, including Lord Kitchener, who was travelling with a delegation to Russia. Together the shaft plus the manganese bronze propellor weigh around  tons.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

These included opening additional beds in other hospitals, and identying available beds in care homes and bringing social workers onto the wards to help discharge patients.However, patients taken to other hospitals as a result of the erts at Craigavon are likely to impact on their capacity in the coming days, putting additional pressure on their emergency departments.Last night, the Western Trust was the latest to struggle to cope with demand, warning patients of long waits in the emergency department at the South West Acute Hospital, where here were  people waiting and  waiting to be admitted to a ward. According to official figures, there were  patients in EDs across Northern Ireland at noon on Monday, of which  had been waiting longer than  hours. Meanwhile, another , Covid- cases and five deaths linked to the virus were reported yesterday.Dr Black said there is growing anger among the medical profession over the deteriorating situation facing patients and staff, saying the Executive was warned this would happen in October when it announced relaxations on hospitality and nightclubs.“Here we are, three weeks down the line, and we’re exactly where we said we would be.“There are core services in the health service, maternity, children’s services, emergency, cancer care, and services for elderly people and we’re now reaching the stage where they aren’t being delivered properly. Patients are waiting too long for an ambulance after having a stroke, and even when they get to the hospital, they’re stuck in the back of an ambulance.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of Health PremiumTaxpayer to pay £k for every person who isolated in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotel PremiumScrapped procedures ‘forcing surgeons into private sector’ in Northern IrelandCraigavon Area Hospital operating at full capacity as Covid- patients double in two weeksNI students to protest Stormont in call to support health workers PremiumGail WalkerOpinionWe are an international Covid scandal and it is solely down to Stormont’s mishandling of crisisMost ReadBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’UVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNIEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsDUP MP Gavin Robinson has emergency spinal surgeryTop VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlaySinn Fein leader calls for a plan for Irish unityPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest CoronavirusCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health serviceTaxpayer to pay £k for every person who isolated in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotelEsmond BirnieOpinionA lesson from history the shows faith need not be at loggerheads with medical scienceHealth Minister Robin Swann calls for mandatory Covid passportsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five further deaths and , cases reportedLatestJohn SimpsonOpinionTrends in the labour market in flux‘The view of what’s possible has changed’Taste of success: Whisky creators raise a glassGalgorm owner’s pandemic £m sales lossLidl’s sales increase by % while its rivals all see drop in takings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCarl Frampton. David O#DornanNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFormer world champion boxer Carl Frampton has said he was knocked out by a chat with wrestling star Drew McIntyre.The Jackal joked that he would have a crack at WWE himself after interviewing the Scotsman for his new BBC Sounds series Carl Frampton – A Dferent League.He said: It was a great experience talking to Drew McIntyre and I got really into it, I really enjoyed our chat. I came away buzzing from itI#m honest.Carl asked Drew what qualities he would need to get him to the top in WWEhe was to follow in his footsteps.Drew told him: Passion and a work ethic for one, and clearly you have that with your background.Plus you have the background which gives you some legitimacy and I can already see situations where you#ve got a deadly punch and people are trying to avoid getting punched in the face by you, so you#ve already got a head start over everybody  just by your background.Size-wise, it#s not as important these days... we#ve got all sorts of shapes and sizes now.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Drew asked two-weight world champ Carl how agile he was and he told ​him he could do a backflip into the pool.The wrestler replied: If you work on it a bit, I reckon you could hit a backflip, so you could add aerial ability along with your striking ability and we#re starting to complete the package here.But the big thing is above all , once you#ve got the in-ring game, you need that character - that#s what#s going to get you popular in WWE.And Carl reckoned he might have that in his locker - but said it would be no more Mr Nice Guyhe did.He said: It seems very important character and charisma. I was always kind of known as, I suppose, a nice guy in boxing.I think people would say that about me, I was always a bit of a joker and laughing with people and I never got really too serious in terms of face-offs and stuff, I just used to laugh it off.So I thinkI was going to be a wrestler, I would like to have the bad guy image.The more I#m talking to you here, I#m looking for a slot on this undercard when you come to the UK.Carl#s chat is the first in his new BBC series and will be followed up with him talking to Belfast MMA fighter Leah McCourt, snooker ace John Higgins and Leeds United and Northern Ireland footballer Stuart Dallas.But he admitted he was self-conscious when he was on Zoom with WWE star Drew because he looked like a big unit.He added: When I sit down, first of all my zip keeps popping open and it has popped open again and my belly kind of hangs over my jeans now.But that was out of shot and my arms look OK, so maybe he thought I was still half decent shape.Elsewhere, the two had lots in common, such as having accents that not everyone can get to grips with.Carl said: It was a little bit dferent for me, you#re on the big screen constantly and having to talk and having to be vocal.I feel like my accent#s probably tamed a little bit over the years as well.The first part of my career, I was in London and nobody knew what I was saying, a broad North Belfast accent, and it was so frustrating trying to buy a bottle of water in a shop.And they also agreed that the sacrices to make it to the top on sport is tough on family le, with Carl paying tribute to his we, Christine.He said: This is something that I think is kind of overlooked at times in sportspeople and people doing well in sport and my we has been a massive influence and a massive support and rock for me as well in doing what I do in my career.” The first episode of Carl Frampton – A Dferent League is available on BBC Sounds from Tuesday, November .Most ReadBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’UVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNIEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsDUP MP Gavin Robinson has emergency spinal surgeryTop VideosPlaySinn Fein leader calls for a plan for Irish unityPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest Northern IrelandCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health serviceDeath of three wild deer struck by cars on busy road sparks call for closer monitoringConcern as PSNI warns  organised crime groups currently operating hereAllison MorrisOpinionUnrest: young ‘hawks’ pressurising loyalist leaders for more protocol protests on streetsMen arrested after bus was hijacked make complaints to OmbudsmanLatestMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWas ex-soldier’s le worth more than an innocent victim’s Covid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health serviceJohn SimpsonOpinionTrends in the labour market in flux‘The view of what’s possible has changed’Taste of success: Whisky creators raise a glass,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Chris J RatclfeSuzanne BreenTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTwenty-one members of the US Congress are asking Secretary of State Antony Blinken to issue a public statement of opposition to the UK Government’s proposed Troubles amnesty.The Congress men and women, led by Richard Neale — chair of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee — and Thomas R Suozzi, have written to Mr Blinken outlining their demands.Grainne Teggart of Amnesty International said: “We strongly welcome this intervention from members of Congress which adds to the noisy chorus of opposition to the UK Government’s plans to permanently deny justice to victims of the Troubles.“The UK Government finds itself increasingly isolated on the international stage with its intent to sacrice the rights of victims for the sake of protecting perpetrators of human rights abuses.“We hope President Biden’s administration will heed the calls in this letter and publicly state their opposition to the UK Government’s attempt to close down paths to justice forever.”Michael O’Hare, who is seeking an independent investigation into the British Army killing of his -year-old sister Majella in , said: “It is heartening to see strong public support from Congress for victims seeking truth and justice. We would like to see the same public opposition from Secretary Blinken.“All those with influence must play their part in ensuring the UK Government heed the outcry at these proposals, abandon these plans and urgently establish mechanisms that will give my family and all victims truth, justice and accountability.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The Congress members’ letter states: “The UK Government plans for dealing with the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland will close all paths to justice for victims denying them the truth, justice and accountability to which they are entitled.“It is clear the UK Government’s primary motivation is to ensure security forces are placed beyond accountability for the human rights abuses committed during the ‘Troubles’.“Given the role the US has, and continues to play, in supporting the Good Friday Agreement ... we urge you to make a public statement of unequivocal rejection of these proposals and work with your counterparts in the UK and Ireland to resolve this matter and ensure the past is dealt with in a victim-centered, rights respecting way. The time to act is now the UK Government is expected to progress legislation in the near future in the UK Parliament.”Meanwhile, Kenny Donaldson from victims’ group SEFF is leading a delegation to Westminster to meet Shadow Secretary of State Louise Haigh, and Labour and Tory backbenchers over the Government’s legacy proposals.He yesterday met former Labour Shadow Secretary of State Tony Lloyd in a meeting hosted by the DUP in Northern Ireland. Mr Donaldson voiced his opposition to an amnesty and called for the controversial On the Run letters to be rescinded in legislation. He said: “We had a very constructive discussion with Tony. As the MP for a constituency which suffered substantially in the Manchester Arena bombing, he has a keen understanding of the impact of terrorism. I also raised the issue of the Irish State’s de facto moratorium on the investigation and prosecution ofIRA members that former Justice Minister Michael McDowell referred to last month — that moratorium denies families justice and must be lted.” Related topicsIRAMost ReadBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’UVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNIEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsDUP MP Gavin Robinson has emergency spinal surgeryTop VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportPlaySinn Fein leader calls for a plan for Irish unityLatest Northern IrelandChristine: I’m more fearful of being alone at home after robbery£m bill for temporary housing of homeless branded ‘disgraceful’Mamma mia!

Credit: Jonathan Porter   Press EyeAdrian RutherfordTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland fans celebrated one of their most famous results after holding the European champions on a memorable night at Windsor Park.In front of an ecstatic sell-out crowd, they held Italy to a scoreless draw — putting a serious dent in their opponents’ hopes of qualying for the World Cup.Read MoreNorthern Ireland deny Italy an automatic spot at World Cup finals with qualying draw in Belfast... and they should have won it“You’re not very good,” the massed Green and White Army cheekily sang, also teasing: “You’re just a s*** San Marino” — a reference to the Italian-surrounded enclave who were being hammered by England at the same time.Northern Ireland were never overawed by their illustrious opponents — and could even have won with Conor Washington missing a late chance.But the mood was still jubilant as supporters piled out of the national stadium after the final whistle.Tommy Smith, waving his Northern Ireland scarf in the air, said: “It was an immense performance — what an effort. The qualication campaign was disappointing but this means we end on a real high.”Northern Ireland’s draw meant Switzerland topped the group after defeating Bulgaria — securing the Swiss a direct passage to Qatar. Italy must navigate the play-offs.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The last reigning European champions to come to town had been the German side of Euro ’ fame in . That game had ended in a - defeat, but fans always believed that Ian Baraclough’s side could pull off a shock here.Ahead of kick-off, Noel Keenan from Lisburn was hoping for another “special” night under the lights, saying: “It’s been a while since we beat Italy at Windsor Park —  was the last time.“They are coming here looking to qualy and will fancy their chances, but I don’t think they know what they are in for with the atmosphere. There are , here when Windsor is full but they make the noise of ,.”David Armstrong, his dad Winston, and son Alfie, from Lisburn, were aiming for more than just three points. Alfie, a big Steven Davis fan, was carrying a sign asking for his hero’s shirt.“My wee boy loves Steven Davis — we made the sign, hopefully he sees it,” explained David.Conor Mulholland, from Dromore, Co Down, who was at the game with Nathan Connery and Geoffrey Moore, was aiming to finish with a win, saying: “Hopefully we can give them a good game — it would be good to finish on a high going into the next campaign.”Stu Cherry, from Annalong, Co Down, said it was important to sign off on a high.“I don’t come to watch the opposition — I would still be herewe were playing Liechtenstein —but it should be good, especiallywe get a result,” he said.This was an occasion that brought back memories of the great nights at the national stadium — big name opposition, a sell-out crowd, expectant fans and qualication on the line.However, this time it was the Italians on the brink. They started the night level on points with Switzerland, needing to win to be sure of qualication.Northern Ireland’s hopes of reaching the finals had gone but the crowd were still right up for this.The atmosphere stepped up a notch when soprano Carly Paoli took centre stage to perform the anthems ahead of kick-off, discarding her blue cape to reveal a Northern Ireland kit to the delight of the Green and White Army.In a goalless first half, the Italians went close early through Giovanni Di Lorenzo, who collected Emerson’s pass but was thwarted by goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell, while Federico Chiesa sent an effort into the side-netting.Otherwise Northern Ireland held them at bay, backed by the raucous home support who rarely stopped singing in praise of ‘super captain Davis’ in what could be the midfielder’s final international appearance.The early stages of the second half saw Northern Ireland on the attack, with George Saville seeing a big chance saved by Gianluigi Donnarumma. Italy went close in the rd minute, Chiesa curling an effort just wide being set up by Domenico Berardi.As the minutes slowly ticked down, every Northern Ireland challenge, every Italian move that ended in frustration, was being loudly cheered. In stoppage time, Washington so nearly won it, rounding the goalkeeper but seeing his effort cleared off the line. Northern Ireland may not be Qatar-bound, but they made their point here — and this result meant the world to them.Related topicsNorthern Ireland Football TeamNational Stadium at Windsor ParkMore On Northern Ireland Football Team PremiumSteven BeacomOpinionNorthern Ireland’s magnico performance to deny Italy has set the standard for Ian Baraclough’s reign PremiumPaul FergusonOpinionSteven Davis won’t get a better Northern Ireland send-off than Italy draw… who could blame him for retiring now Steven Davis and Jonny Evans ‘aren’t ready’ to retire after helping Northern Ireland halt Italy, says boss Ian BaracloughNorthern Ireland - Italy player ratings: Jonny Evans leads the way on another big night at Windsor ParkNorthern Ireland deny Italy an automatic spot at World Cup finals with qualying draw in Belfast... and they should have won itMost ReadBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’UVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNIEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsDUP MP Gavin Robinson has emergency spinal surgeryTop VideosPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlaySinn Fein leader calls for a plan for Irish unityPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest Northern IrelandDeath of three wild deer struck by cars on busy road sparks call for closer monitoringConcern as PSNI warns  organised crime groups currently operating hereAllison MorrisOpinionUnrest: young ‘hawks’ pressurising loyalist leaders for more protocol protests on streetsMen arrested after bus was hijacked make complaints to OmbudsmanStormont pays out £m in last year over claims relating to road defectsLatestJohn SimpsonOpinionTrends in the labour market in flux‘The view of what’s possible has changed’Taste of success: Whisky creators raise a glassGalgorm owner’s pandemic £m sales lossLidl’s sales increase by % while its rivals all see drop in takings,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Obviously the colouring on the shirts from the time is wrong,” he said.Looking at the footage I suspect the camera was on the pitch so the players were going through the motions for it to be recorded.It’s such a window on days gone by, so far back that you can’t even comprehend it. The way they’ve done it with the sound effects makes it almost tangible.I suppose any time you look at old footage, even from World War One, it’s always speeded up. So to see it in real time and enhanced is breathtaking actually.”Commenting on the distinctive style of the football kits, he said: “Oh that was the norm, definitely of its time.When you look at the modern game and how light and airy everything is, it’s hard to imagine being able to move in them at all.Making things even harder was that the grounds around the Oval at the time was marshlands, meaning the pitch would have flooded regularly.Reports from back in the day would have told you that supporters would often have to help drain the pitch. Playing in those big boots and long shorts wouldn’t have been easy.”In , Mr Robinson added that east Belfast was beginning to expand with the development of the shipyards.The amount of people coming in from the country to seek work meant that streets were popping up everywhere,” he said.It was all very much working class and six, seven or eight people to a house. It was very heavily populated working class area, but a vibrant area nonetheless.Certainly a lot of unskilled work and large families, infant mortality was re. From my own research it would appear that everyone in the house was expected to bring in an income.If the men were working in the shipyard, the women were in the rope works and linen mills. Even the children were expected to go out and sell sticks on the street.It was a very interesting place to be. All the heavy industry seemed to be based along the Lagan in the east.”He said men suddenly finding themselves with some disposable income with football becoming their leisure time.What appeared to happen is that Glentoran had around five dferent pitches in a  year period. It seemed to be the case that every time they moved they had to move somewhere larger to accommodate them.No doubt the rise of the club was inextricably linked to the growth of the shipyards. Glentoran was the local team they all followed.”Mr Robinson said a newspaper advert from  seemed to suggest that shortly after the game was filmed it was shown in the Belfast Empire.So the Lumiere Triograph was pretty much a camera and a projector all in one,” he said.That meant that Alexandre Promio could project it at the Belfast Empire. Even though the clip was really small, the audience were said to have stood up and cheered because it was a real match. They had never seen a real match.”Most ReadBBC NI’s Donna Traynor quits: Legal matters prevent presenter from explaining ‘leaving the job she loves’UVF Belfast Shankill march policing ‘appropriate and proportionate’: PSNIEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsDUP MP Gavin Robinson has emergency spinal surgeryTop VideosPlaySinn Fein leader calls for a plan for Irish unityPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayVideo: Billy Connolly - Terrorist Attack At Glasgow AirportLatest Northern IrelandCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health serviceDeath of three wild deer struck by cars on busy road sparks call for closer monitoringConcern as PSNI warns  organised crime groups currently operating hereMen arrested after bus was hijacked make complaints to OmbudsmanStormont pays out £m in last year over claims relating to road defectsLatestMalachi O#DohertyOpinionWas ex-soldier’s le worth more than an innocent victim’s Covid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health serviceJohn SimpsonOpinionTrends in the labour market in flux‘The view of what’s possible has changed’Taste of success: Whisky creators raise a glass,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI.

Her family said they are incredibly proud of Ava for using her own birthday to raise money and help other children.Ava even decided to have her birthday cake made with the charity’s colours. Her proud mum, Becky McEvoy, said: “The idea came about by me explaining to her that there are children who dont have any hair due to dferent types of sicknesses and their treatments. “I then showed her The Little Princess Trust’s Instagram posts and she automatically said Mammy, can I do that  I want to help boys and girls have beautul hair like mine.’ “Of course, it was no surprise to me, her daddy and the rest of our family. Ava is such a loving, kind and caring little girl that it is just in her nature to help others. “Ava was due to have her hair trimmed when I spoke to her about it so she already had about nine inches of donatable hair but we hoped that Ava would have - inches as she had only decided in the August and her birthday was on November . “My sister, Ava’s aunty Cheryl, set up a Just Giving page to raise money for the charity and we had originally set a target of pound to help the charity with the cost of turning Ava’s hair into a wig for a young person.” Ava has since smashed this target and has raised over pound between the fundraising page and cash donations from family, friends, her primary school and Irish dancing school. Becky continued: “We asked Courtney, at local hairdressers, Hair by CC, to cut Ava’s hair the day after her birthday. “Once Courtney had cut Ava’shair,she jumped up to go look in the mirror and check out her new hairstyle and of course loved it. “Every morning she gets up and looks in the mirror and says Mammy, I just love my new hair. “As her Mammy, I am incredibly proud of Ava, so is her daddy and the rest of her family. Ava is just an inspiration to everyone. “We cant thank everyone enough who was able to donate to help her help a young person feel like themselves again. “Ava has a younger brother who is ten months old and we cant wait until he grows up a bit so we can explain to him how incredible his big sister is.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Flynn is a Psychology student at Queen’s University, Belfast. We were highly impressed by Flynn’s commitment to his studies, his family and his community.” The bursary scheme was established in  in memory of Patricia Hughes, a well-known teacher at St. Columb’s College. Highlighting the signicance of the bursary scheme, Patricia’s sister, Mary Delargy, said: “After Patricia’s death in , we wanted to do something positive to continue her work as a pastoral leader in St. Columb’s. “Patricia was an extremely dedicated teacher and always went above and beyond for all of her students. In  we established the Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme. “The bursary provides pound each year for a pupil from a low-income family to support them through their time at university.” “Flynn is a fantastic ambassador for the Bursary Scheme. Flynn has already done a substantial amount of voluntary work to support his community and we were immediately struck by his commitment to the values of the bursary scheme. We are looking forward to working with Flynn over the coming months and years. “We are so appreciative to the Bursary Committee and the wider school community for sustaining the bursary over the past few years. “Family, friends as well as former staff and pupils have contributed signicantly to the bursary and, in doing so, kept Patricia’s memory alive. We know she would be deeply proud of the work being done in her name.” Paacutedraig Delargy, Patricia’s nephew, outlined the success of the bursary to date: “Since  there have been five recipients of the Bursary scheme. “Having finished university myself in , I know first-hand the economic pressures of third level education. The Bursary offers a chance to alleviate some of that burden and recognises the outstanding contributions the boys have made to their school and wider community.” Two of the pupils who have benefitted from the bursary,Odhraacuten McGlinchey andBilly Quigley, recently took part in a video describing Ms Hughes and how the bursary has helped them. Odhraacuten said: “It takes the stress off the bills -it wasn’t for the Bursary, I don’t know what I would do.” Remembering Ms Hughes, Billy said: “My first thought is she always had a happy aura around her. That made her really approachable. There were a few times when I was struggling and I came to Miss Hughes and she was always willing to lend a hand.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Flynn is a Psychology student at Queen’s University, Belfast. We were highly impressed by Flynn’s commitment to his studies, his family and his community.” The bursary scheme was established in  in memory of Patricia Hughes, a well-known teacher at St. Columb’s College. Highlighting the signicance of the bursary scheme, Patricia’s sister, Mary Delargy, said: “After Patricia’s death in , we wanted to do something positive to continue her work as a pastoral leader in St. Columb’s. “Patricia was an extremely dedicated teacher and always went above and beyond for all of her students. In  we established the Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme. “The bursary provides pound each year for a pupil from a low-income family to support them through their time at university.” “Flynn is a fantastic ambassador for the Bursary Scheme. Flynn has already done a substantial amount of voluntary work to support his community and we were immediately struck by his commitment to the values of the bursary scheme. We are looking forward to working with Flynn over the coming months and years. “We are so appreciative to the Bursary Committee and the wider school community for sustaining the bursary over the past few years. “Family, friends as well as former staff and pupils have contributed signicantly to the bursary and, in doing so, kept Patricia’s memory alive. We know she would be deeply proud of the work being done in her name.” Paacutedraig Delargy, Patricia’s nephew, outlined the success of the bursary to date: “Since  there have been five recipients of the Bursary scheme. “Having finished university myself in , I know first-hand the economic pressures of third level education. The Bursary offers a chance to alleviate some of that burden and recognises the outstanding contributions the boys have made to their school and wider community.” Two of the pupils who have benefitted from the bursary,Odhraacuten McGlinchey andBilly Quigley, recently took part in a video describing Ms Hughes and how the bursary has helped them. Odhraacuten said: “It takes the stress off the bills -it wasn’t for the Bursary, I don’t know what I would do.” Remembering Ms Hughes, Billy said: “My first thought is she always had a happy aura around her. That made her really approachable. There were a few times when I was struggling and I came to Miss Hughes and she was always willing to lend a hand.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Ms McLaughlin said:“My thoughtstodayare with victims and survivors of these horric institutions who are hopefully finally at the beginning of the end of a very long road. While theJoint First Ministersannouncement is welcome, I still have a number of serious concerns about how the recommendations of the Truth Recovery Design Panel will be delivered. “We have repeatedly seen in the past how the Executive Office and Joint First Ministers have struggled with delivery and there can be no delay on an issue of this importance. Nearly five years on from the Hart report, victims of historic institutional abusein childrens homesare still waiting for payments, an apology and a memorial and this cannot be the case for survivors of mother and baby homes. Both of these matters must be expediated as a matter of the utmost importance. “In both cases the institutions responsible for this abuse must be compelled to fit the bill and compensate victims, they have been guilty of the worst abuses imaginable against vulnerable people and cannot expect others to pick up the pieces.  “I am also concerned that the legislation to establish the public inquiry cannot be introduced in this mandate. The survivors of mother and baby homes have waited long enough and shouldn’t have to wait a day longersomething can be done. Our institutions are currently under threat and with parties unwilling to saythey will assume office depending on the election result, I fear mother-and-baby home survivors could become the latest casualties of the dys that rules this place.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Ms McLaughlin said:“My thoughtstodayare with victims and survivors of these horric institutions who are hopefully finally at the beginning of the end of a very long road. While theJoint First Ministersannouncement is welcome, I still have a number of serious concerns about how the recommendations of the Truth Recovery Design Panel will be delivered. “We have repeatedly seen in the past how the Executive Office and Joint First Ministers have struggled with delivery and there can be no delay on an issue of this importance. Nearly five years on from the Hart report, victims of historic institutional abusein childrens homesare still waiting for payments, an apology and a memorial and this cannot be the case for survivors of mother and baby homes. Both of these matters must be expediated as a matter of the utmost importance. “In both cases the institutions responsible for this abuse must be compelled to fit the bill and compensate victims, they have been guilty of the worst abuses imaginable against vulnerable people and cannot expect others to pick up the pieces.  “I am also concerned that the legislation to establish the public inquiry cannot be introduced in this mandate.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Ireland and Ireland in opposition to their legacy proposals which subvert the rule of law and suppresses justice, truth and accountability.  googletag.cmd.push Current Downing Street proposals create a wholesale amnesty for those in state agencies and illegal militias responsible for the worst in the conflict. It slams shut the door to effective criminal investigations, to the already small prospect of criminal prosecutions, to inquests and to civil actions. All should stand in solidarity with victims and survivors. The scale of the amnesty is immense. A recent report said it was the worst proposed anywhere in the world, worse than the + models over recent decades in places emerging from conflict, worse than that introduced by the Pinochet military dictatorship in Chile. STAKE KNIFE IS FRONT and CENTRE Why  What is to fear  The proposals would mean that the current Jon Boucher Kenova investigation into the activities of the British agent known as Stake Kne would be closed. There are people – members or previously members of state agencies and militias - who will not want Kenova to see the light of day, want to see its work and its outcomes suppressed. Stake-kne is front and centre in the thinking behind the London approach.  The justied rage against all of this is rightly directed against London. But suppression of justice and truth is the agenda of state agencies and the illegal militias. Those in command and control of both have a common interest that less not more is known, that the spotlight fades from the brutality of what was visited on the people of Derry and the people of Ireland. UNANIMITY The opposition travel far beyond victims and survivors and political parties. The United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed grave concern over the British Governments legacy proposals and said they foreclose the pursuit of justice and accountability for the serious human rights violations committed during the Troubles and thwart victims rights to truth and to an effective remedy for the harm suffered, placing the United Kingdom in flagrant violation of its international obligations. The Council of Europe speaks out, the Dublin Government, US political leaders… the weight and range of opposition is verging on unanimous. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS FIRST The most critical voices are those of victims, survivors and advocates. Together they speak out against these proposals. Their voices are clear and true and dignied and powerful. The victims groups I have met with reject these proposals wholeheartedly not because they want to remain in the past but because they have been denied fundamental truths about what happened to their loved ones. For years, families and victims groups have kept up the fight for truth and justice for their loved ones in their own reserved, dignied way. Earlier this year, I called on Boris Johnson to come with me to meet the Bloody Sunday families, the family of Paul Whitters and the countless loved ones of those killed by the IRA and tell them that they are not entitled to go through the justice process like everybody . He is yet to take me up on my offer. It shows that even Boris Johnson cannot look victims and families in the eye. He cannot produce the worst model of amnesty in decades anywhere and then claim that reject it as barriers to reconciliation. I have walked the same streets with victims campaigners where the British Army and paramilitaries murdered their loved ones, I have stood with them outside  Downing Street against these flagrant attempts by the British Government to close off remaining routes to truth and justice. Victims and families deserve respect and to be consulted because the only proper way to a reconciled future is to listen, understand, and engage with those our troubled past has affected most. WE ARE SECOND CLASS The British Government proposals create separate classes of cases. People across Derry will be subject to the rule of law, to criminal investigation for wrongdoing. You and me and our families and friends. But another group of people will receive special treatment because of the unorm they wore. They will not be subject to the rule of law. We will be second class citizens. In this great city, the frontline of democratic resistance to being treated as second-class, now in  it is alive and well. In addition,murder by the British Army, a state force or paramilitary happened in Newcastle, London or any other city in Britain, these proposals wouldnt even be entertained by the British government of the day, never mind being railroaded through against the wishes of those whom it will affect. WAITING As the MP for Foyle, I have raised the cases of Paul Whitters, Julie Livingstone and Paul Quinn with Boris Johnson and have called out his government at every turn when they act in bad faith on legacy. Last November, I called for a public inquiry into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane and challenged the s that successive British Governments have gone to in an attempt to deny justice to his family including having to pursue accountability through interminable court proceedings. And still the Finucane wait and still so many other families wait for justice, truth and accountability. FOUNDATION STONE Parties here, along with Irish and British administrations, negotiated the legacy proposals contained within the Stormont House Agreement, including establishing the Historical Investigations Unit. While the SDLP wanted legacy processes to be more rigorous with more powers to get to the truth, Stormont House was the agreement. It remains the foundation stone. Nowyou wore a maroon beret or a balaclava, the Tories an others are looking the other way on your crime for political expediency. TOGETHER We have now reached a critical juncture in how we choose to stand up for victims and their families as well as truth, justice, and accountability for all. The SDLP will never allow the British government to trample over internationally recognised agreements, and more importantly, the rights and wishes of victims and families to pursue truth and justice. Victims and their families will continue their long march against unfair legacy proposals, and we will be with them every step of the way.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

The general reaction to the outcome of COP has been one of frustration – one that Mr Eastwood echoes. India and Chinas fudge on the issue of phasing out coal use angered many and the Foyle MP warned that the move by those two nations has put a constraint on the main of saving the planet. He said: “While a number of welcome measures have been agreed following COP I cannot help but feel the overall sense emerging from the conference is one of failure, frustration and missed opportunity. “The decision to concede to India and China’s demand to phase down, rather than phase out coal is inconceivable. Burning fossil fuels is one of the key contributors to the climate crisis due to the amount of carbon emissions they produce. “While stopping using them completely won’t be easy, it’s the only choice we havewe are going to save our planet. “This COP also failed to adequately address the destruction taking place in our poorer and developing countries as a result of the climate crisis. If we are going to get to grips with tackling these issues then our leading nations must provide support to those with less resources and major corporations must adopt climate friendly practices or face the consequences. “The chance for world leaders to agree a radical worldwide plan to tackle the climate crisis has been blown – but hope is not lost. Its been heartening to see the strength of will that exists to tackle this issue, particularly from our young people. “For too long our politicians have ignored the climate crisis raging all around us and COP has put it at the centre of public discourse. “Real climate action won’t be easy, we will all be required to change the way we live, but there is no alternative and we must take the wins that were secured in Glasgow and push for further movement ahead of COP in Egypt. “The SDLP will continue to fight to ensure that the climate crisis remains the uppermost concern at both Westminster and in the Assembly. “I am currently bringing forward a bill at Westminster which will force the British government to declare a climate emergency, bring forward the date to achieve net zero emissions, introduce a strategy to achieve new green jobs, guarantee a just transition and create a green corporate levy on large companies to help fund climate action. “It’s a matter of deep regret that the North is currently the only part of these islands without dedicated climate change legislation and targets and that must be immediately addressed.”  Arrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park     Mary Robinson hits out at shameful dereliction of duty on climate change     Put your thinking COP on - Young Irish people encouraged to participate in National Youth Climate Summit   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Police are appealing for any information regarding the dead man found at his home in the Moss Park area of Derry on Friday, November , Local NewsArrests made after -year-old man found dead in Moss Park overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient, Flynn BurkeDerry NewsPatricia Hughes Bursary Scheme announces latest recipient overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A late Fintan Bradley free drops just over the bar as Lavey chased a goal.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by Mark Doherty.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Leadon Timberframe Derry IHC final Banagher - googletag.cmd.push Lavey - Banagher survived a late scare to clinch the Derry intermediate hurling title with victory over Lavey at Owenbeg this afternoon. In the final minute of stoppage time, Fintan Bradleys lobbed free fell just over the bar, with the rippling of the net setting hearts racing around the stand. Moments later, the final whistle brought the curtain down on a tense, competitive Derry intermediate hurling final, with Banaghers slender two-point lead proving enough to take the title. Erins Own will rue a total of  wides throughout the game, seven of them in a profligate opening quarter which left the Gulladuff men trailing by - to -. It was the attritional encounter that Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey had anticipated, with Banaghers incessant pressing and tackling forcing his side to shoot under pressure. At half time, Banaghers double-score lead was intact, and although Fintan Bradleys frees kept Lavey in touch, by the second water break St Marys still had them at arms . The north Derry side had two opportunities to put the game to bed in the final quarter, and were almost punished when Ryan Mulholland blazed a goal chance wide for Lavey with five minutes left. A frantic final few minutes culminated with Bradleys hanging point that for a moment had hearts in mouths throughout the stand. Banagher advance to an Ulster IHC meeting with either Castleblayneyor Middletownon the weekend of November . *Full report and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Mark Doherty.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Leadon Timberframe Derry IHC final Banagher - googletag.cmd.push Lavey - Banagher survived a late scare to clinch the Derry intermediate hurling title with victory over Lavey at Owenbeg this afternoon. In the final minute of stoppage time, Fintan Bradleys lobbed free fell just over the bar, with the rippling of the net setting hearts racing around the stand. Moments later, the final whistle brought the curtain down on a tense, competitive Derry intermediate hurling final, with Banaghers slender two-point lead proving enough to take the title. Erins Own will rue a total of  wides throughout the game, seven of them in a profligate opening quarter which left the Gulladuff men trailing by - to -. It was the attritional encounter that Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey had anticipated, with Banaghers incessant pressing and tackling forcing his side to shoot under pressure. At half time, Banaghers double-score lead was intact, and although Fintan Bradleys frees kept Lavey in touch, by the second water break St Marys still had them at arms . The north Derry side had two opportunities to put the game to bed in the final quarter, and were almost punished when Ryan Mulholland blazed a goal chance wide for Lavey with five minutes left. A frantic final few minutes culminated with Bradleys hanging point that for a moment had hearts in mouths throughout the stand. Banagher advance to an Ulster IHC meeting with either Castleblayneyor Middletownon the weekend of November . *Full report and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Catherine Comer.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis,  Bridie McMenamin Shield semi final  googletag.cmd.push Magherafelt - Attical- Rossa camoacutegs eased their way into a historic Ulster final meeting with neighbours Creggan of Antrim after a dominant performance brushed aside Down champions Attical on Saturday afternoon. In stark contrast to the previous weeks wind and rain, Saturdays conditions allowed for a much more expressive game, and it was Magherafelt who ultimately took advantage. The Derry champions made one change to the side that ground out the win over Crosserlough in the quarter final half forward Shauneen McGuckin replacing Ellie McGuckin in the starting line up. While the scoreline suggests otherwise, Attical were competitive in the early stages, with Megan Sloan and Shari McNally causing Rossa problems. Magherafelt, though, weathered any early pressure and took a - to - lead into the first half water break, and from then on never looked in any real danger. By half time, the lead was six points, and three second half goals from Sineacutead Comerand Briacuted Corrigan saw the hosts canter home with  points to spare over the Mourne side. Eyes will now turn to the far side of the Lough and Antrim side Creggan, who will pose a much sterner test in the final this weekend. *Full report in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community. There have been some episodes recently where children have been running through gardens and hedges at homes of elderly people.ldquoI would ask them to give these members of the community the peace and space they deserve and consider their feelings in pursuit of fun, he said.BALLYKINLAR mdash Ballykinlar cross-community playgroup has been strongly praised by education inspectors for providing a positive ethos which promotes childrenrsquos confidence and self-esteem.The Department of Education report lists a number of strengths of the playgroup which operates out of the old school on the Carricknab Road.Staff are headily praised for their leadership and dedication to the children and the inspectors found there were only a few areas which need attention.ldquoThe staff treat the children with care and respect and provide a secure, supportive environment which helps the children grow in confidence and independence, said the report.SAINTFIELD mdash The achievements and success of the younger pupils at Saintfield High School were cerebrated during a special junior school prize day last week.The principal, Mr Robert Miss, said the school prided itself on being a family school offering support, interest and encouragement in all the pupils strive to achieve.Mr Mills proudly pointed out that the schoolrsquos well established year eight induction programme seeks to ensure that all new pupils entering Saintfield High School settle quickly into their new environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_stpatrickday.jpg","title":"Green light for St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"A ST Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is scheduled to go ahead next year.The Recorder can confirm that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is pressing ahead with plans for the event which regularly attracts thousands of visitors to the town.The cross-community spectacular was last held in , with last yearrsquos event one of the districtrsquos first high profile casualties of the emerging coronavirus pandemic.The parade was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions to help prevent the spread of the deadly virus, but council officials are confident the event can go ahead next March.With Covid restrictions now eased, they are keen to see the  parade take place with details surprisingly unveiled to councillors in private during Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.As the public health emergency has eased slightly, a number of councillors believe that as the parade is an outdoor event, it will be able to proceed, provided people continue to exercise caution.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, said while there are over four months to go before the parade would be held, ious plans have to be put in place.He said decisions have to be taken now to ensure that all the pieces in the eventrsquos jigsaw are in place and believes that the current environment allows for the popular event to proceed.ldquoPublic health advice rightly prompted the decision to cancel the last two St Patrickrsquos Day parades but the situation has changed. The fact that this will be an outdoor event is also an important factor in deciding that it can proceed, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe virus is still in circulation, but a signicant number of people have been vaccinated and things are certainly a lot dferent compared to last year. Protecting peoplersquos health remains important and we should all continue to wear a mask when required to do, exercise good hand hygiene and maintain our distance from others.Cllr Curran said the past  months had been some of the most dficult people across the district haf ever faced, suggesting news that the St Patrickrsquos Day is due to proceed will provide them with a glimmer of hope for the future.ldquoThere have been many large outdoor events over recent months and normality is slowly to starting to , but there is no room for complacency and we must all continue adhering to the public safety message, he continued.ldquoThe St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is hugely popular and people who regularly attend it now have something to look forward to.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo. He was th overall .Maureen Kelly was full of beans and went off like the clappers but soon realised that she would be better setting her own pace rather than getting sucked into the speed of others.She sensibly slowed and found a more sustainable rhythm completing in . in nd place.Janine Murray has been running well but with a heavy cold and a hamstring niggle, this is one race she is happy to have behind her. She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years. Subject to funding being made available, it is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement, and a further  months to construct the scheme.The spokesman explained that as part of planning for the winter gritting programme, the Department ensures that adequate staff are available, all winter service equipment is in satisfactory working order and that there are adequate supplies of salt.He added: ldquoWhile the Department generally salts the main through routes which carry more than , vehicles per day, in exceptional circumstances, roads with dficult topography carrying between , and , vehicles daily will also be salted.ldquoGrit piles are also available for use by the public on a self-help basis on selected routes not included on the salting schedule and arrangements are in place to enlist the help of private contractors and local farmers to assist in efforts to clear blocked roads in rural areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Multi agency  response call on foul smell  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called for a multi-agency response to two issues of concern in the Dundrum area.Northern Ireland Water, the Department for Infrastructure and Rivers Agency have been asked to address recent damage caused by flood water at the Moneycarragh River, with the utility company and Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos environmental health department asked to investigate the cause of foul smelling liquid seeping from land close to Dam Lane in the village.The appeal for the ious agencies to work together on both issues has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.In relation to the Moneycarragh River, the councillor has called for the waterway to be ldquoed to its natural state, with the appeal coming after recent flooding which led to a burst pipe resulting in a number of consumers in the area left without supply.In June, Cllr Lewis raised concerns of local farmers with NI Water after a concrete floor was installed on the floor of the river, directly under Bennettrsquos bridge which runs over it.ldquoThe work prevented water from pooling, which subsequently forced floodwater to erode stone walls and the river bank which exposed a water supply the pipe which was damaged by rocks and it burst, he added.Cllr Lewis claimed rising floodwater has also undermined the integrity of the bridge and widened the river banks which exposed the water supply pipe.ldquoPreviously, farmers were able to drive machinery down the natural land slope to collect water from the river for animals and farm use, but this access has been altered so much that a sizeable dip has been left on the river bank.Cllr Lewis said the damage was ldquopredictable and claimed that the manipulation of the riverrsquos natural flow has, over time, distorted its integrity, warning that erosion which will eventually cause the collapse of the supporting walls at the bridge and adjoining roadway.He has asked NI Water and roads officials to urgently join forces to address the issue andthe river bed to its natural state.Turning to Dam Lane, Cllr Lewis says he hopes local afgghghuthority environmental health officials and NI Water will be able to address the issue.ldquoI recently received numerous complaints regarding a foul smelling fluid which has been seeping onto the pavement at this part of the village.

A nation which remembers the evils of fascism and honours those who fought to defend it will be the better for so doing. As a country we should have a more rounded view of the way of the world for remembering the sacrice of pervious generations, a realisation that there is real evil out there and sometimes war is a moral imperative in order to be on the side of right.Saturday’s Festival of Remembrance was a fitting reminder of the price which was paid because it had to be paid.But there was a glaring omission which should cause us to reflect.Around a year ago I spoke to a friend about ways in which the centenary of Northern Ireland could be marked. He came back to me with a set of excellent ideas, one of which was to lobby the Royal British Legion for inclusion of a tribute to the sacrice made to defend Northern Ireland’s place within the UK over the last  years in the Festival of Remembrance. Jim Allister raised this issue with the NIO both in a meeting and in writing. He wrote to the Royal British Legion on the matter. He raised it with the Northern Ireland Veterans’ Commissioner and I know Mr Kinahan sought to progress the matter. Yet on Saturday reference to this part of the UK was absent.An ideal opportunity to remember the service and sacrice of the B Specials, the RUC, the UDR and the countless British Army regiments who served in Northern Ireland and gave so much was lost.An opportunity to remember that in part of the UK people were murdered for remembering the sacrice for freedomwas lost.Three summers ago I attended the Royal British Legion event at the Menin Gate to mark the century of the Great Pilgrimage and as I sat in the stands the lady next to me asked why I had a badge on my lapel remembering Enniskillen — I wear it to all remembrance events and to work every day in Stormont to act as a reminder of what some of the people I meet up there did and why I should never be comfortable in the building. I explained to the lady my connection and with tears in her eyes she told me that her husband had dug people out of the rubble that day.That lady hadn’t forgotten. Yet there was no place to remember any of the suffering and sacrice in our centenary year.A nation remembered on Saturday. Yet it is so, so telling when one considers what it chooses to forget.Could it be that the decision to exclude specic mention of Northern Ireland was part of the wider UK government policy of total disinterest in defending the proud record of Her Majesty’s forces in our Province Samuel Morrison, TUV Dromore, Co Down• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : NHS workers should be required to have Covid vaccines• Ben Lowry Nov : Essays in  about NI on its  centenary foresaw province staying in UK but not change from within• Owen Polley Nov : Woke theories on history, gender and race get ‘stormy applause’• Peter Robinson Nov : Opinion polls matter,questions are well-defined• Patrick Roche Nov : Archbishop’s comments a moral indictment of unionism• Esmond Birnie Nov : Increasing interest rate now could lessen pain down the line• Kenny Donaldson Nov : Amnesty admission makes mockery of Irish legacy criticism of Britain• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : A draining Sunday along the border, then at Lyra film• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But it was.There is good reason for unionists to be upset by the nationalist rhetoric that has come out of Dublin, particularly since . This has included scathing criticism of the UK amnesty plans, criticism that is utterly hypocriticalin light of Ireland’s own de facto amnesty for the IRA.But at the same time it is important to recognise the deep symbolism of these welcome and poignant Remembrance Sunday visits to Enniskillen, and the way that successive Irish governments have made them a fixture. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

General view of the entrance tot he Royal Victoria Hospital AE Department in west Belfast. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe boss of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust said it was “exceptionally close” to declaring a major incident alert.Shane Devlin said the health service in Northern Ireland was “on the edge”.The worsening situation within the region’s under-pressure health system comes amid increasing Covid- transmission rates, particularly among young people.Responding to the incident in Craigavon, the British Medical Association called on the Stormont Executive to revisit the issue of vaccine passports as a priority.Making certication a legal entry requirement for hospitality venues has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people in the Irish Republic.North of the border, the Executive has recommended that nightclubs and other venues carry out Covid entry checks and an official app has been developed to enable people to show proof of their vaccine status.However, the administration has stopped short of making it a legal requirement of entry.The issue has ided the five-party coalition, with the SDLP and Alliance Party calling for legally enforceable Covid passports for nightle venues.BMA Northern Ireland Council chair Tom Black said: “We have not even entered the winter months when traditionally we see our hospitals under tremendous pressure.“Hospitals and indeed our whole health service was already struggling, but Covid and the added pressure from an increased number of patients is simply too much.“We need to address these issues now. While vaccines are doing the job of keeping many people out of hospital, we also need to see masks being worn, contacts limited where possible and for everyone to come forward for boosters and flu jabs. The Executive should also revisit the use of Covid passports as a priority.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused the two main Executive parties – the DUP and Sinn Fein – of political “cowardice” and he warned that Northern Ireland could be facing fresh restrictionscertication was not introduced urgently.The DUP and Sinn Fein have expressed doubts over a mandatory system, indicating their preference for a “partnership approach” with the hospitality industry.“The message from our health service has been clear – they are on the brink of collapse and want to see urgent mitigations introduced, including the immediate introduction of vaccine certications to take the pressure off staff and allow patients to get the care they need,” said Mr Eastwood.“Health Minister Robin Swannhas previously warned that our hospitals will have to turn people awaythe situation worsens and we saw that play out last night at Craigavon Area Hospital.“Sinn Fein and the DUP have thus far shown stunning political cowardice on this issue, a total abdication of leadership. They are unwilling to take the tough decisions needed to protect our health service and the public. This isn’t easy, since calling for the introduction of vaccine certications myself and party colleagues have been harassed and protested against but our primary concern remains protecting people.“We now face a stark choice, time is running out and this decision should have been made weeks ago. To protect our health service, so that cancer sufferers, people in need of urgent operations and others in desperate need of medical attention get access to the treatment they need, we will have to introduce vaccine certication or further restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.”However, DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was not in favour of compulsory certication.“I don’t support that at all,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.“I am very clear that vaccination is the best means of creating normality and it has allowed us to create a signicant normality once again in terms of our day-to-day lives.

Picture Matt Mackey   Press Eye.“I think now is the time for the phased introduction of Covid certication in Northern Ireland,” he told a Stormont news conference today.Mr Swann said he would bring a proposal to the Executive on Wednesday when he said ministers could discuss the timing of the move and what settings it should be initially applied to.“Our view as a Department of Health is that we should be using all the tools that are in our options to use,” he added.Mr Swann said he would like to see the mandatory system being rolled out as soon as the legal regulations were in place – a process he said would take between two to three weeks.He acknowledged there would be a need for engagement with the hospitality sector in the interim.Earlier, Mr Poots said he was not in favour of compulsory certication.“I don’t support that at all,” he told BBC Radio Ulster this morning.“I am very clear that vaccination is the best means of creating normality and it has allowed us to create a signicant normality once again in terms of our day-to-day lives. “And I think that, you know, people should get vaccinated and I’ll encourage and cajole and pressurise and have done that with people who I know who have been hesitant.“But forcing people to do something isn’t going to work. “It’s not going to get those last few over the line. Over % of people are vaccinated and we need to continue to encourage the remainder to get vaccinated, but forcing them is not going to work.“And I don’t think that creating a two-tier system for so many things is something that I would be prepared to accept.”DUP’s Paul Frew is extremely opposed to the introduction of Covid passports believing they will only serve to cause discrimination.Following Mr Swann’s announcement, he commented on Twitter: “The Health Minister wants to bring into law a discriminatory practice to exclude people dues to their health status and history without any evidence of positive health outcomes or impact assessments.”Fellow DUP councillor Nathan Anderson said: “This heavy handed approach to vaccine passports punishes EVERYONE.”Shortly after Mr Swann’s announcement, Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill tweeted: “The executive will meet again on Wednesday with a focus on the huge pressures in the health service.“We will continue to be guided by the health advice to take whatever steps are necessary to protect the public and avoid another lock down scenario.”SDLP minister Nichola Mallon commented: “I am relieved that finally other ministers are beginning to see sense and realise that we must introduce vaccine certications to protect our health service and keep our businesses open. “SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood first urged the introduction of vaccine certication nearly two months ago and I have proposed and consistently raised it at the Executive, only for it to be opposed by the UUP, Sinn Féin and the DUP. “I welcome Minister Swann’s u-turn on this issue and hope Sinn Féin and DUP Ministers soon follow suit.BMA Northern Ireland Council chair Dr Tom Black said: “We have not even entered the winter months when traditionally we see our hospitals under tremendous pressure.“Hospitals and indeed our whole health service was already struggling, but Covid and the added pressure from an increased number of patients is simply too much.“We need to address these issues now. While vaccines are doing the job of keeping many people out of hospital, we also need to see masks being worn, contacts limited where possible and for everyone to come forward for boosters and flu jabs. The Executive should also revisit the use of Covid passports as a priority.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

At thelowest point, in the early summer, Covid patients accounted for around two per cent of all hospitalisations in Wales.But despite the recent rise in Covid patients, we are a long way off the worst of the pandemic, when in January this year more than one in three hospitalisations in Wales was due to coronavirus.What comes next Vaccines have \"weakened\" the link between infection and serious illness, meaning the situation Wales faced last winter should not be repeatedndash at least to the same extentndash this time around.

Mask-wearing in shops and on public transport, social distancing and the recommendation to work from home when you can.Non-essential items were blocked off in Welsh supermarkets during the fire-break lockdown in autumn .

Today, first minister Mark Drakefordndash after receiving his own booster shotndash said: \"I would like to thank all the NHS staff and volunteers that have worked tirelessly over the last few months, to ensure that the vaccination programme has been such a success here in Wales.\"I urge everyone that is offered a booster vaccine to turn up for their appointments.\"We must do everything we can to keep everyone safe as coronavirus has not gone away.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
