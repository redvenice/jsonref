[{"url":null,"title":"The creator Downton makes movie Louise Brooks Hollywoods voracious maneater","story":"Share this article Aged nine, Brooks was molested by a house painter, an ordeal she blamed for her subsequent incapacity to ever feel real love and, instead, seek simple sexual pleasure.\u0027Nice, soft, easy men were never enough — there had to be an element of domination,\u0027 she said. \u0027The men who were the worst in bed were the men I liked the most.\u0027At 17, she became a chorus girl in a Broadway show notorious for nudity (publicity pictures of Brooks wearing only a carelessly flung scarf and a pair of sandals came back to haunt her when she was a film star).         Before Brooks she left for California, she had a passionate two-month affair with Charlie Chaplin (pictured)Many showgirls — including her — were glorified prostitutes, as she later admitted: \u0027There was a hand-picked group of beautiful girls who were invited to entertain the great men in finance and government.\u0027 The girls — screened by two film producers, Walter Wanger and Englishman Eddie Goulding — had to be \u0027fairly well bred and of absolute integrity\u0027, she said.\u0027At these parties we were not required, like common whores, to go to bed with any man who asked us, but if we did the profits were great. Money, jewels, mink coats, a film job — name it.\u0027One of these powerful men with film industry connections was Daily Express newspaper tycoon Lord Beaverbrook, who Brooks described as an \u0027ugly little grey man who went directly to his object with no finesse\u0027.She would later say that her \u0027sexual education had been conducted by the elite of Paris, London and New York\u0027. She got noticed by the right people.Brooks had no acting training but, aged 18, accepted a five-year contract with Paramount Studios.Before she left for California, she had a passionate two-month affair with Charlie Chaplin. The British star was twice her age, married and at the height of his fame. They moved into New York\u0027s Ambassador Hotel and spent much time with Peggy Fears, Brooks\u0027 17-year-old best friend, and Peggy\u0027s fiancé, financier Alfred Blumenthal.Brooks told friends the foursome once had a three-day champagne-fuelled orgy in Blumenthal\u0027s suite at the Ambassador, rarely bothering to get out of bed. Brooks later claimed she and Fears had been lesbian lovers and that Blumenthal had his butler secretly photograph them together.She caused further scandal by revealing that Chaplin was so scarred by his mother contracting syphilis that he never had sex without first painting his sexual organ with iodine to try to prevent any possible infection.Brooks hated Hollywood and the shameless sexism of the studio system which regularly tossed aside established female stars for younger, more malleable starlets.She treated Tinseltown with the insouciance she felt it deserved, never bothering to see her movies and, between takes while filming, burying her face in books by German philosopher Schopenhauer.When journalists came to interview her, sometimes she couldn\u0027t be bothered to get out of bed. One described her as \u0027exquisitely hard-boiled\u0027. Brooks told a biographer: \u0027I was always late. But too damn stunning for them to fire me.\u0027By the time she was 19, \u0027Brooksie\u0027, as she was known to friends, had married British-born playboy and director Eddie Sutherland. They rarely saw each other and neither bothered to be faithful.Their relationship was so fraught that when Hollywood was shaken by a small earthquake one night, Brooks thought the tremor was her husband making a move on her as she slept. She walloped him on the jaw, vowing that if he did it again, she\u0027d move into a hotel.When, a year into their marriage, Brooks returned to visit New York, she renewed her dalliance with Peggy Fears and Alfred Blumenthal. This time, the fourth member of their menage was Brooks\u0027s new lover, laundry millionaire George Preston Marshall.In 1928, less than two years after their wedding, she orced Sutherland after falling \u0027terribly in love\u0027 with Marshall. Sutherland claimed Brooks\u0027s insatiable sexual demands drove him to impotence and to seek psychiatric help.The actress, who resented being branded a nymphomaniac, said she had affairs simply to stave off boredom and \u0027pass the time waiting for the studio to call\u0027.Englishmen made the best lovers and Irishmen the worst, she said.Yet Brooks didn\u0027t say \u0027yes\u0027 to everyone. She turned down a director who pursued her for 15 years when \u0027hundreds of less attractive men succeeded in the hay\u0027 with her. The reason? He had bright pink rims around his blue eyes.She encouraged her reputation as a lesbian, saying women had pursued her since she was 15. This was simply another outlet for her endless sexual curiosity.She claimed she had one night of passion with Greta Garbo, her screen idol, when they were both in their early 20s. She described Garbo as masculine but a \u0027charming and tender lover\u0027.Always perverse, Brooks would later insist she was strictly heterosexual and that her Sapphic dalliances \u0027did nothing for me\u0027.Short-changed in Hollywood contract renegotiations and fed up with being cast as a \u0027pretty flibbertigibbet\u0027, Brooks flounced off to Berlin in 1928. There, she wallowed in the city\u0027s notorious debauchery and made some of the best films of her career.In Pandora\u0027s Box, she played Lulu, a sexually uninhibited showgirl whose thoughtless behaviour leads to prostitution and ruin. The role could have been written for her.She also made a film in Paris, where the director said she would have been the \u0027ultimate actress\u0027 were it not for her industrial alcohol consumption. She was almost continually drunk on cognac and champagne, he said, and had to be carried to the set each morning because she was asleep.She even had her make-up put on while she was sleeping and was woken \u0027only to shoot a scene, after which she returned to drinking\u0027.Her method of overcoming a hangover was to take three big swigs of gin.Returning broke to Hollywood in 1930, still just 24, she\u0027d left behind a host of enemies after haughtily refusing to dub dialogue on an earlier picture which had been shot as a silent.Columbia promised her a contract but its boss, Harry Cohn, made it clear he expected her to sleep with him, appearing shirtless at all their meetings.When she refused, he ensured her career sank in a succession of B-movie roles.Brooks sealed her fate when she rejected the female lead alongside James Cagney in the 1931 gangster film The Public Enemy because she wanted to visit a boyfriend in New York. It was one of the decade\u0027s most successful films.Her second marriage to industrial heir Deering Davis lasted five months. As with her first rich husband, Brooks was too apathetic towards money to seek a penny from him when they orced.As her career disintegrated, she continued to play the field in Hollywood. One of her numerous one-night stands was with Humphry Bogart. They were so different, she said: he could only love a woman he had known a long time while, for her, \u0027love was an adventure into the unknown\u0027.Brooksie left Hollywood for good in 1938. She ended up in New York where she got a job as a salesgirl in a department store.She still indulged her prodigious sexual appetites, sometimes joining the actress Tallulah Bankhead at sex parties to which Bankhead invited boat-loads of sailors.As she descended into alcoholism, Brooks became, at 36, a call-girl for three rich Manhattan clients for almost a decade.\u0027It was very discreet and, all things considered, infrequent,\u0027 said a friend. \u0027She did what she had to do.\u0027From 1960, she became a recluse, living in a spartan flat in the New York town of Rochester. She was \u0027rediscovered\u0027 by film buffs and had a second act as an acerbic writer, astutely critiquing actors and Hollywood. She converted to Catholicism and died of a heart attack, aged 78.Though recklessly blunt and free-spirited, even she could be embarrassed by her own outrageous behaviour. She wrote a tell-all autobiography, Naked On My Goat, but was so appalled that she threw it into an incinerator. "},{"url":null,"title":"British Superdry founder worth 441m uses old Nokia insists having emails printed out","story":"Share this article          Dunkerton is married to Jade Holland Cooper, 32, and carries around an old Nokia phone which he uses to make and receive calls onlyBut Dunkerton\u0027s only phone is an old Nokia model which is capable of making and receiving calls - and that\u0027s all.He said: \u0027I watch people everywhere, all looking at their iPhones, and I think I\u0027m lucky that I can take a step back and watch and think without this constant interference that everyone else has,\u0027 according to the Telegraph. \u0027My brain is probably freer to comprehend what is actually happening around me and make better decisions because it\u0027s not clogged with rubbish.\u0027Picking up a phone takes a second, whereas writing an email takes 10 minutes, which is a wasted nine-and-a-half minutes.\u0027Dunkerton started his foray into fashion with a Cheltenham market clothing stall, which later evolved into the brand Cult Clothing.

Mrs Gilmour now helps other women understand the warning signs to look out for. She has written books on the subjectShe said: \u0027I met him at work whilst I was studying at university and at first found him to be charming, friendly, relaxed and a person that everyone liked and got on with.\u0027He was so complimentary to me when we first started dating and it was something that I really enjoyed, as I hadn\u0027t really been given them before.\u0027I wasn\u0027t a confident person and had been bullied at school, and didn\u0027t have a great opinion of myself, but he was so caring and listening and everything I thought that I could ever want in a partner.\u0027But he mis-sold himself to me, as he was actually nothing that he said he was on the back of the tin.\u0027Soon her former partner was regularly asking her to cancel plans with friends to spend time with him instead.         As part of sharing her story and helping others, Mrs Gilmour has written two books and achieved an award for Most Informative Blogger in 2018. She recently won the WOW award by Jacqueline Gold to recognise the achievements of women starting their own businessesShe said: \u0027At first I didn\u0027t see the signs that he was an abuser, as what he did was so subtle and simple. \u0027He first started by isolating me from my friends as when I told him I was going out with them, he used to tell me that he thought we were meant to be going out that night, or said he wanted to spend time with me and could I rearrange.\u0027I felt loved and went along with it, but he did it that much that I lost my friends and also lost contact with my family, who he stopped me going to see, so I didn\u0027t go back to Hull in two years as he refused to let me.\u0027And his extreme jealousy meant she could not offer male colleagues lifts home as he would refuse to sit in the passenger seat if he knew another man had been there.She added: \u0027As soon as we entered into the relationship, there was lots of jealousy if I spoke to other men, or if other men looked at me. \u0027But I was kind of flattered really as I was young, and had seen similar jealous behaviour in rom-coms and just thought it was normal.\u0027It was all about control all the time - he didn\u0027t like me working as I could mix with my colleagues, and he used to say it would be a burden for him to look after the kids if I went to work to try to get me to stay.\u0027He also used to accuse me of cheating on him when I never did, and I had to stop giving male colleagues lifts home from work, as if he knew I had, he would refuse to sit in the passenger seat as he said I\u0027d let another man sit on it\u0027.And by the end of the relationship the coersive control had gained such momentum that he used to throw things near her to scare her in to submission.She said: \u0027The violence towards me was physically invisible, but I had internal bruising on the inside from what he put me through.\u0027I would try and prevent arguments or issues, like washing up before he got in as he was obsessed with me keeping the house clean, but it would never be good enough and he would always cause a problem and tell me that I could never get things right.\u0027If I was going on a date with him and putting make up on he would tell me that I must be doing it for another man rather than him.\u0027He used to call me names too, and at one point I did put on weight because I was diagnosed with having a brain tumour so I struggled to keep the weight off and comfort ate, but instead of helping me, he told me that I had more roll backs than Asda.\u0027 Their relationship ended after several years when Mrs Gilmour was helped by a friend who she is now happily married to.But it was only when Mrs Gilmour got out of her toxic relationship and went on a domestic abuse awareness course that she realised she had actually been a victim.\u0027Five months after I left the relationship, I went on a recovery course to try and find my personality again and discover who I really was. It was there that I found out that I had been in a domestic abuse relationship, and I just broke down in tears.\u0027I thought that everything that had happened in the relationship was because of me and took on all the blame for it, but it was then on that course that I realised that it was actually all him, and it was a complete weight off my shoulders.\u0027I knew that he shouldn\u0027t have treated me in the way he did, but I really thought it was my fault and pitied him and tried to support him even though towards the end I really disliked him.\u0027He changed the blueprint of me as a person, and I\u0027ve had to spend a lot of time trying to find myself again\u0027.Now Mrs Gilmour works as an author and advocate for women in abusive relationships and tours the country to share her experiences and through this raise awareness of coercive and controlling behaviour, as well as signposting support resources to victims.\u0027My journey has certainly not been easy and I still face challenges every day,\u0027 she said.\u0027Thankfully I have learnt how to balance life, and with the help and support of others I am able to focus on the rewarding side to being an advocate.\u0027I am passionate about standing up for the changes that need to be made and the awareness their needs to be.\u0027If more people knew what an unhealthy relationship looked like then this could change the horrific statistic that domestic abuse will affect one in four women and one in six men in their lifetime\u0027.As part of sharing her story and helping others, Mrs Gilmour has written two books and achieved an award for Most Informative Blogger in 2018.

And last year more than 4,000 Christians were killed because of their faith.In 2015, Christians faced harassment from governments or social groups in 128 nations, according to the Pew Research Centre.

Flames and smoke rise from the blaze at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on Monday evening         In total, about 245 million Christians endure oppression worldwide, according to the campaign group Open Doors. (Pictured) Jeremy Hunt leaving Downing StreetShould religious persecution matter in an increasingly secular world? The truth is that, if a regime tries to control what you believe, it will generally seek to control every other aspect of your life.Where Christians are persecuted, other human rights are often brutally abused.Yet the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, passed by the United Nations General Assembly without a single negative vote in 1948, enshrines ‘freedom of thought, conscience and religion’.The declaration makes clear that everyone has a right to the ‘practice, worship and observance’ of their faith.Britain has always championed freedom of religion or belief for everyone. In my first weeks as Foreign Secretary I prioritised the plight of the Rohingya Muslims, horrifically targeted by the army of Myanmar (formerly Burma.) But I am not convinced that our efforts on behalf of Christians have always measured up to the scale of the issue.In the Middle East, for example, the survival of Christianity as a living religion now hangs in the balance. A century ago, about 20 per cent of people in the region were Christians today the figure is below five per cent.The bitter irony is that Christianity is retreating in the very region of its birth, where its earliest followers worshipped. Anxious not to offend minorities or appear ‘colonialist’ in troublespots around the world, British governments have occasionally taken refuge behind the principle that all religions must be protected.But this must include Christianity, where those targeted are often extremely poor, female and living in or close to poverty.         Pope Francis leads the Easter Vigil mass at Saint Peter\u0027s Basilica in Vatican City, Rome         Queen Elizabeth II, who is head of the Church of England, distributes Maundy money during the Maundy Thursday service at St George\u0027s chapel, WindsorWe must not allow misguided political correctness to inhibit our response. So I have asked Rt Rev’d Philip Mounstephen, the Anglican Bishop of Truro, to conduct an independent review of the Foreign Office’s efforts to help persecuted Christians and report back to me later this year.Questions need answering: do we counter oppression based on religion as forcefully as that based on politics or other characteristics? How can we use the considerable influence the UK has in much of the world to better stand up for religious minorities?I hope he will recommend practical steps for how the Government might strengthen its response.When I moved house last year, I came across a book that I first read when I was about ten. It was called God’s Smuggler by Brother Andrew van der Bijl, a Dutch missionary. At the height of the Cold War, when Christianity was struggling against communist oppression in Central Europe, Brother Andrew began to smuggle Bibles across the Iron Curtain. His book quotes Karl Marx’s famous boast about mobilising the letters of the alphabet to fight ideological battles: ‘Give me 26 lead soldiers and I will conquer the world.’Brother Andrew noted how ‘this game could be played both ways’. So he set off for Marxist capitals, carrying suitcases packed with Bibles, helping Christians to preserve their faith in defiance of iron-fisted repression.When I first read God’s Smuggler, it was barely possible to hope that the Iron Curtain would one day fall. So when the Berlin Wall dissolved before our eyes in 1989, it was a wonderful blow for freedom, allowing all the European countries that Brother Andrew had visited to win their liberty.Yet perhaps this good news has made us complacent about problems elsewhere. Exactly 30 years later, 245 million Christians are still at risk. The evidence suggests that far from easing, the burden of worldwide persecution is actually becoming heavier.So as we celebrate Easter today we must not be indifferent.This year I marked Lent by writing 40 letters to 40 persecuted Christians or those campaigning on their behalf. My first letter was to Brother Andrew, now 90, assuring him that the UK stands in solidarity with persecuted Christians around the world: ‘Freedom of religion or belief is a human right enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It must be respected. People from all faiths or none should be free to practise as they wish.’I will continue to make this case for the millions who suffer as a result of their beliefs and British diplomats will continue to be advocates for all those denied the right to practise their faith.Many of the recipients of those letters, by dint of the danger they are in, should not be named publicly. But they include men and women, clergy and worshippers, who have been personally targeted by terror organisations, had their churches attacked or been imprisoned by draconian regimes.Britain is on their side.

Photograph: Sam BoalRollingnews.ieSelf-styled “revolutionary party” Saoradh, which paraded in paramilitary style through Dublin on Saturday, said “if republicans were involved” in the killing of journalist Lyra McKee in Derry on Thursday night, “then the IRA should apologise”.Ms McKee (29) was shot dead during riots on the Creggan estate in Derry. The PSNI have said they believe those responsible for her death are connected to the “New IRA”. Two men have been arrested in connection with with the shooting .Up to 200 members and supporters of Saoradh who joined an Easter 1916 commemoration in Dublin on Saturday, heard national executive member Dee Fennell say the McKee family was “suffering an intolerable loss”.Mr Fennell said his own family had suffered due to the killing of a family member in the past and he reiterated that if republicans had shot Ms McKee “then the IRA should publicly accept responsibility and apologise”.Ms McKee had been “tragically killed” he said and such killings had never been the policy of republicans. He recalled that when he lived in the Ardoyne, the IRA had apologised for the killing of two women in the 1970s and 1990s “publicly or privately”.Earlier, as marchers gathered at the Garden of Remembrance at Parnell Square, the Wolfe Tone Republican Flute Band engaged in practice banging of drums which could be heard a kilometre away on D’Olier Street. A large number of uniformed gardaí were present, and plain-clothed detectives passed thorough the crowd.Tricolours and the slogan “unfinished revolution” were hung from lampposts and shortly before the 3pm start of the march, a group in military uniforms wearing berets and sunglasses appeared. The paramilitaries were followed by a group in 1916-style clothing, seemingly re-enacting the Good Friday 1916 rebellion.As the march got underway one man walked to the centre of the road hands on his head, blocking the march, but stewards instructed the marchers to “go around him”.A number of flute players passing down the street jostled the man who stood his ground. After a while a march organiser stood in front of the man, directing marchers away.A statement issued by Saoradh on Friday claimed 29-year-old McKee was “accidentally killed”.Gardaí said the march dispersed with no incidents."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3867242.1555754774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"negative brexit consequences are uk s responsibility juncker","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission. Photograph: Jasper JuinenBloombergAny kind of Brexit will have “negative consequences” which will be worse for Britain than the EU and be entirely the UK’s responsibility, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said.Mr Juncker said the “ball was in Britain’s court” and urged the House of Commons to support the deal negotiated by British prime minister Theresa May. A second extension to Brexit was granted to the UK following talks in Brussels earlier this month, with the so-called “flextension” meaning the departure date will be October 31st this year, or sooner if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed.In an interview with the German Funke Media Groupe, Mr Juncker repeated the words of European Council president Donald Tusk and urged the UK “not to waste time”.He said: “We have to be prepared for a soft as well as a hard Brexit.“In any case, the exit will have negative consequences — for the British more than for the EU.“There will be no single market-based solution. As I see it, the British side bears 100 per cent of the responsibility for this.”Mr Juncker, who is not intending to stand for a second term as European Commission president in 2019, addressed the idea of a more federal Europe saying that the EU should “not become a melting pot in which all differences disappear”.When questioned about the idea of a United States of Europe, he said: “We should give up (using this term).“I do not believe that we will ever have a centralised American-style state. I do not wish it to happen either.”The interview comes as campaigns for the European elections are springing into action — with former Ukip leader Nigel Farage due to visit Nottingham on Saturday as part of the campaign for his Brexit party.Britons are due to go to the polls to elect 73 MEPs in May after delays to the Brexit process meant the country was bound to return representatives to Brussels, despite the prospect of them having to leave office only a few months later.–PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

They are only legally allowed to protest in Marble Arch.There was a marked shift in the way police were treating activists at the illegal encampments as videos emerged of campaigners being pushed over or dragged along the ground after being arrested. Officers also began dismantling and removing parts of the encampment on Waterloo Bridge.Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, had earlier demanded the “full force of the law” be used to end the demonstrations and the subsequent disruption to the capital’s ‘transport networks.The Met enlisted the help of some 200 extra officers from neighbouring forces to help police the protest and the mass arrests.Cressida Dick, the Met’s Commissioner, said her officers faced unprecedented challenges in trying to clear the protesters.Explaining how she was very proud of the work of thousands of officers over the past six days, she added that she was aware armchair critics would feel things could have been done differently.“We have shown that we are strong, we are determined,” she said. I have never - I\u0027ve been a police officer for 36 years - I have never known an operation, a single operation, in which over 700 people have been arrested. It shows we are determined and we will carry on.Jake Green, a 20-year-old actor who had spent the week at the protests, said: “We will swarm Parliament Square and make them admit there is a climate crisis and respond to us before it\u0027s too late.”Another who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested there could be a renewed attempt to target the Underground system.Demonstrators in Parliament Square as night fell on SaturdayOthers activists who had been arrested claimed they were being taken as far away as Southampton and Brighton to be processed before being released. All of them said they were told they were under investigation, their offences did not merit being remanded in custody and so would be released. They then returned to London to continue their protest.The Met’s request for “mutual aid” from constabularies in the South East meant they obtained one ‘protest removal team’, containing seven officers trained to remove those who had glued or locked themselves to objects, and eight ‘basic deployment units’, each made up of 25 public order trained officers.In a statement, Scotland Yard admitted the protests were putting a “strain” on the force resulting in officers in the city’s boroughs being required to work 12-hour shifts, with rest days cancelled, and the Violent Crime Task Force having had all leave withdrawn. The force currently has 1,000 police patrolling the three sites.Police officers remove items used by Extinction Rebellion protesters from Waterloo BridgeA Scotland Yard spokesman said: “One thing that is unusual about this demonstration is the willingness of those participating to be arrested and also their lack of resistance to the arrests.”Greta Thunberg, the teenage founder of the school strikes against climate change is expected to address the protesters on Easter Sunday.The 16-year-old Swedish activist is due to meet senior British politicians next week having already met with Pope Francis and addressed the EU Parliament.Ministry of DefenceSri Lanka church and hotel explosions: More than 150 dead in Easter Sunday bomb attacksQueen\u0026#39s birthday: watch her 93 years in 93 secondsThe real brains behind University Challenge: meet the question settersFacebook criticised by cancer support groups after blocking accounts that share surgery scar imagesHow nimbys halted one of the world\u0026#39s most ambitious renewable energy drivesComment: Do any of these smug, protesting green activists actually work for a living?Comment: Why it’s time toComment: Whether we believe or not, modern society is defined by the story of EasterCasualties after several explosions hit churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter SundayComment: From Anne Boleyn to the zombie pigs, our understanding of the human brain has progressed very littleClare Balding: Entertain clients at women\u0026#39s football games, not just men\u0026#39sAir strikes and explosions hit Libyan capitalFamilies evacuated as wildfires spread across Yorkshire moorland on hottest day of the yearLabour activist who claimed Israeli lobby \u0026#39manufactured\u0026#39 anti-Semitism crisis selected as MEP candidatePioneering brain surgery that allows deaf children to hear to be funded across the NHSHeat technology in prisons to trace illicit mobile phones to precise cellsPublic urged to stop using their favourite football team or band as their passwordThe Importance of Being Oscar, review: a studiedly uncontroversial primer on the greatest and queerest of the wits Labour activist who claimed Israeli lobby \u0026#39manufactured\u0026#39 anti-Semitism crisis selected as MEP candidateWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/07/22/TELEMMGLPICT000113285172_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqh7fo3NWXQpX_GVnoCYNT5DKmqlMGaOioj_LKmAqpJus.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"clare balding entertain clients womens football games not just","story":"Clare Balding is presenting a new Channel 4 women\u0026#39s sport showCompanies should entertain their clients at women\u0027s sports matches as often as they do at men’s to boost crowd numbers, Clare Balding has said.The  BAFTA-winning broadcaster also called for club owners to take more risks by putting on games in large venues and promoting the hell out of it or offering school children discounted tickets to fill the seats. Speaking to The  as her new Channel 4 women\u0027s sport show launches, Balding said she does not care if it gets a poor reception from viewers. Women’s Football World with Coca Cola sees Balding present six episodes featuring women’s football players from across the globe, with highlights footage from a handful of the world’s league...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeAlready have an account?

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a pleasant surprise because I’ve had a lot of fun on those shoots.”Created with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Numerous summary articles and ruinous posts are littered across the internet, and you might even come into contact with one without trying.That means that any fans should be advised to take proactive measures if they don\u0027t want to find out what happens in the film before it comes out at the end of the month.Thankfully there are a whole host of tools that can make it easier to ignore anyone trying to ruin 2019\u0027s biggest film for you.Created with Sketch. Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.With the potential to be the most frustrating of platforms – links can fly into your feed without you realising – it\u0027s helpful that Twitter offers built-in tools to make it easy to mute just about whatever you like.Every Avengers character ranked from worst to bestHead into the settings on desktop or mobile and find the Muted Words option. You can then add all the words you want, and they\u0027ll be banned from showing up on your Twitter, even if you then move to other devices.Last year, Facebook finally added the option to mute keywords, something that previously could only be done with fiddly extensions and a lot of work. The relatively new feature, called Keyword Snooze, is made for exactly this kind of situation.The unfortunate thing is that you\u0027ll have to wait until you see an Avengers: Endgame post before you can actually mute them, by which point you might already have fallen victim to the spoilers. If you do see something that includes keywords that you want to mute, you can click the option in the corner of the post, which will give you the option to snooze a selection of the words included in there for 30 days.Instagram doesn\u0027t let you mute specific words in your feed. Helpfully it\u0027s probably not all that likely that anyone will actually ruin a film through their posts, though of course it\u0027s always possible someone will post the leaked footage or some other annoying spoiler.It does however let you mute topics in the Explore tab, which might be useful, since they come from strangers and are so more likely to include surprises in them. Do that by long pressing on any of the topics that pop up there, which should let you mute that channel.Remember, too, that Instagram does have the option to mute\u0026nbsppeople, as well as topics. So if there\u0027s someone you\u0027re worried about spoiling it for you, you can head to their profile and select the mute option – either pre-emptively or in anger.It is possible to pick the nuclear option and, Thanos-like, remove the half of the internet that is threatening you with spoilers.\u0026nbspSearching through the extensions available for your browser should give you a whole host of options that will let you mute certain keywords, in a variety of different ways.Always be vigilant about doing so. First, you might miss important information if your keywords are chosen too widely: you\u0027re probably safe muting Avengers, but Endgame might get in the way a little more. And secondly, these extensions work by reading through the pages you\u0027re browsing on, so make sure they\u0027re made by someone dependable.Keyword muting and vigilance will only get you so far: the fact is, there are some people out there desperate to share spoilers, whatever the cost. And if they\u0026nbspare sufficiently clever about it, they are always going to be able to get around keyword filters, by using unexpected or very generic wording.The only foolproof way to avoid spoilers entirely is to leave the internet.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone. Lenders are in the business of lending to businesses, not owning them.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

This cannot be allowed to continue.”Under the CMA’s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a “cosy” relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to “milk the cash cow of consultancy business”.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain’s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA’s proposals, with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain’s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes,” said John Allan, the CBI president.“Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion-style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other packages were also found at Heathrow Airport and London City Airport, with the police saying they were bombs. Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The growing use of apps by schools is making it easier for parents to contact teachers directly 247, adding to their workload and affecting their health, the NASUWT teaching union has said. One in seven are expected to communicate with parents electronically in their own time every day, according to the survey of 1,500 teachers, while nearly one in five are expected to do this several times a week. Nearly three in four (71 per cent) of teachers say their email addresses are made available to parents despite the majority of them saying they did not give permission for their personal details to be shared. \u0026nbspChris Keates, general secretary of NASUWT, said many members have said they are getting “a lot more aggressive contact” from parents in emails, social media and apps such as Class Dojo.

One in four teachers physically attacked by pupils once a week or moreShe said: “What teachers have told us is that there does seem to be a lot more of parents not just questioning what children are doing but taking at face value what they are saying, and that results in them getting an aggressive email when actually there is another side to the story.”The survey also revealed that two in five teachers often receive work-related emails during periods of sickness absence. And one teacher said their headteacher contacted them on WhatsApp when they were off sick with cancer asking them to work from home. “Teachers are not just facing the intrusion of those who manage them into their private lives, but there is now an unreasonable expectation that they are available at the convenience of parents,” Ms Keates said. In January, education secretary Damian Hinds said teachers should not have to email outside of office hours, adding that the situation for teachers is “intense”. He called on schools to review their school practices to reduce workload and “shift away from an email culture”\u0026nbspto free teachers up.“It’s the tyranny teachers are facing in their inbox, which is all part of an anything-goes management culture this government has allowed to flourish across schools, where teachers’ health and wellbeing is not even given a second thought.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The two-year session was a recognition that the enormity of carrying out EU withdrawal would take time and dominate political life.However, back in June 2017, no one expected to be trapped in the current, never-ending crisis. But, here we are, which means the planned June 2019 Queen’s Speech is now receding into the distance.What will local and European elections tell us about Brexit?The dilemma facing Theresa May is that, unless there is a Brexit breakthrough – and none seems likely – MPs will have nothing to do when they return after Easter, so new legislation would normally follow.But what is the point of a Queen’s Speech put together by a prime minister who is a dead woman walking, destined for a humiliating exit from No 10 in months, if not weeks?Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The choice is between the absurdity of announcing a legislative programme a successor could quickly abandon – or the farce of MPs twiddling their thumbs for many months.Worse, a Queen’s Speech creates a lip-licking opportunity for Ms May’s Brexiteer enemies to accelerate her departure, by voting it down to force her out and finally bury that hated agreement with Brussels.\u0026nbspFurthermore, a new session requires a new negotiation to secure continued propping up by the Democratic Unionist Party – at a time when relations with the Northern Ireland party are ice-cold, because it opposes the orce deal.Post-Brexit price hikes see families spend billions more on goodsBrexit supporter jailed for sending MPs death threats and racist abuseWhy are anti-Brexit parties not working together in EU elections?Corbyn ‘must commit to Brexit vote’ or Farage will snatch Euro winLeaked correspondence seen by The Times showed Whitehall has been told to work towards a new parliamentary session “in or around June 2019”.However, the odds must be on a delay – after all, this prime minister rarely sees a road without opting to kick the can down it.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeCreate a commenting name to join the debateIndependent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeReturn to videoWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

In other words, there are some things that so important to Labour but they are not really as important to her.”Mr Belfort is travelling to the UK in May for a series of four talks and “VIP networking events”, with tickets selling for up to £1,000.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

To keep us safe in a dangerous worldGovernment spending foreign aid money to promote fracking in ChinaUK can now use foreign aid budget to help richer overseas territoriesPenny Mordaunt, the international development secretary who has positioned herself for a possible leadership contest, has previously described the aid budget as “unsustainable” in its current form during a cabinet meeting.\u0026nbsp She told colleagues in January that ministers should shift its focus towards attracting private donations, and thereby reducing reliance on taxpayers’ money.\u0026nbspReferring to this, Mr Carden said: “We’ve already heard from Penny Mordaunt ideas about watering down the public contribution of GNI in order to try and use profits from Dfid investments to make up the 0.7 per cent,” he said.\u0026nbspHe continued: “Really, in terms of Tory leadership candidates putting themselves forward, if they believe scrapping aid is a popular policy for the Tory party membership then that’s what I’m fearful of.”“I am concerned that a Tory leadership candidate will be making promises, and using the aid budget... as a political football in that forthcoming Tory leadership race and that certainly does put the whole aid budget under threat.”\u0026nbspMinister under fire for labelling foreign aid budget ‘unsustainable’“It was David Cameron that had compassionate Conservatism at the heart of his leadership and I think that’s what we’re seen being torn down now by these hard-right candidates that are obviously seeking the premiership.”Mr Carden’s comments come after he told the National Education Conference in Liverpool earlier this week his party would “do things differently” if Labour was to win power at a general election, including the formation of a dedicated unit within DfID “that focuses on public services”.\u0026nbsp“Putting public education systems are at the centre of Labour’s DfID plans is crucial because, when provided free and universally, they are vital to building more equal societies,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Unlike privatised systems, public education systems do not discriminate in who can access services,\u0026nbspso children from across society can realise their right to the education they need, regardless of their parent’s ability to pay. It’s only through putting people, rather than profit, at the heart of the agenda that will be able to meet the development challenges of our time.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000. Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Counterterror officers are investigating the three devices as linked following a series of evacuations. One of the packages opened by office staff at Heathrow Airport burst into flames. Scotland Yard did not rule out the existence of other bombs. “The packages – all A4-sized white postal bags containing yellow Jiffy bags - have been assessed by specialist officers to be small improvised explosive devices,” a spokesperson said. “These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened. “The Met Police Counter Terrorism Command is treating the incidents as a linked series and is keeping an open mind regarding motives.”Large waves crash over the sea walls at Cleveleys near Blackpool, as the remains of Storm Freya, which has battered Britain with gales, heavy rain and snow causes widespread travel disruptionChristopher Hepworth with partner Tanisha Prince (right) on their way to victory in the annual UK Wife Carrying Race at The Nower in Dorking, SurreyPolice officers search near the scene on St Neot\u0027s Road in Harold Hill, east London following the fatal stabbing of a 17-year-old girl on Friday night.

The proportion of people in work is at its highest since comparable records began in 1971, boosted by an increasing number of women entering the labour market.A significant proportion of consumer spending growth has also been fuelled by cheap credit with growth in unsecured debt outpacing wage increases. New Bank of England data suggests borrowers will find it more difficult to access\u0026nbspnew debt in the coming months.Lenders said they had tightened their credit scoring criteria for loan applications in the first three months of 2019, with the proportion of loans being approved also falling.Interest-free periods on new credit card lending shortened significantly in the first quarter and further reductions are expected in the next three months.Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International, said the latest numbers were good news.“Even accounting for the Beast from the East, which kept shoppers at home a year ago, today’s retail sales data show households willing to spend more,” he said.“That reflects a slow recovery from a decade-long wage squeeze and, perhaps, a willingness to look through the apparently never-ending uncertainty that is Brexit.“Higher retail sales contribute to a picture of the economy beginning to show more positive signs. Growth is low, but falls in inflation appear over and real wages are rising, suggesting a little more steam in the economy.”Consumer behaviour is in stark contrast to that of businesses which are cutting investment as the terms of Britain’s departure from the EU remain unclear.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rossi Lothario Adams II, also known as Polo, was convicted of conspiracy to interfere with commerce by force after enlisting his cousin, a former felon, in a home invasion plan. Adams was the owner and operator of social media company “State Snaps”, which amassed over a million followers for its depictions of university life on platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. According to a statement released by the US Attorney’s office, State Snaps was characterised by “images and videos of young adults engaged in crude behaviour, drunkenness, and nudity”.Adams’ followers often used the slogan “do it for state”, which resulted in Adam’s looking to buy the domain name “doitforstate”, but he found that the address was already registered.

Some of them were found guilty of planning attacks in Kosovo.The government said a form of radical Islam had been imported to Kosovo by non-governmental organisations from the Middle East after the end of its 1998-99 war of secession from Serbia.United States of AmericaOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This letter to the people of the UK was written in a police cell, where I was held for six hours.The information is from my memory, having spent the past  years following climate science. I have never been an activist, nor have I been arrested before.I came to London to join the Extinction Rebellion and was camping at Marble Arch and protesting at multiple London sites until my arrest on Wednesday afternoon.The Extinction Rebellion aims are: For the Government to tell the truth about climate change, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by  and to form a Citizens Assembly to determine how we achieve this.Preventing climate catastrophe is the most important political, social, environmental and technical problem humanity has ever faced.The Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Changeis the United Nations body which assesses all available science related to climate change. It suggests a number of routes to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to .C. It also tells us that an increase of C will have much worse effects.All pathways to a maximum .C rise require cuts of around  per cent in global emissions within about  years. To have any chance of achieving this, we need to take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions.So far we have caused global average temperatures to increase by .C since the end of the s. We are already seeing the spread of wildfires, hurricanes, drought, melting icecaps, sea levels rising, ocean acidication, coral reef die-off and the largest scale extinction of animal and plant species since the end of the dinosaurs.The IPCC is predicting C to C of warming based on our current trajectory. With these changes, the Earth will not look like the one we recognise today, but rather like the planet of million years ago. Then there was no ice, temperatures were inhospitable and sea levels much higher — dferences that would totally destabilise ecosystems and society.As climate change continues, human-induced effects are amplied by earth processes, such as methane from melting permafrost and reduced reflection of light back in to space as polar ice sheets shrink. These processes will make global heating worse and are sometimes called tipping points, as they can lead to runaway climate change where the human effects are no longer the main drivers — and they are impossible to halt.Since human climate change was first predicted by Swedish physicist Arrhenius in , thousands of scientists, working for decades in dozens of countries and disciplines, have come to a consensus that climate change is real and the effects catastrophic. There is no scientic debate to be had.The Government is complacent about the UK’s emission reductions, while failing to meet its own targets.Given the situation, I feel the Extinction Rebellion is our last best shot at getting governments to listen and start telling the truth.Once the truth is being told I believe that YOU will be urging the Government to act fast and vote accordingly.My involvement in the rebellion and my arrest are my heartfelt attempt to do whatever I can to help prevent the worst effects of climate change and the social, environmental and financial costs it will cause.I am sorry for the disruption caused to local businesses and commuters.I also apologise to the politan Police for the ersion of resources. My experience of the Met is that there has been an atmosphere of mutual respect between them and protesters.I ask that you, the people, become properly informed about climate change. I also ask that Government, businesses and public bodies start taking transformative action now to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.Finally, I ask for a Citizens Assembly, a representative group of the population which will determine the direction we take to get to zero carbon and will take decisions out of the electoral cycle and political and financial influence.The protesters in London represent a broad church of opinion but I would say my opinions and background are typical.If you have read this far, thank you very much.PIERS writes his letter from a police cell – and for that reason, I cannot take him seriously. He and his fellow protesters might think their cause is noble, but breaking the law is not.Equality before the law is one of the most important principles of British justice. The expectation has always been thatyou commit a crime, you will do the time.Yet for days now, parts of central London have been overrun by a rag-tag band of climate change activists, Piers among them.Setting up makesht camps at Oxford Circus, Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square, members of Extinction Rebellion have blockaded roads. And they appeared to be doing so with the support of the politan Police and the force’s boss, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan.Their cause is an important one, but like every good hostage taker, Extinction Rebellion has come armed with a list of demands, and protesters are prepared to be arrested to secure them. Yet even Extinction Rebellion must have been surprised the blockades were not removed for four days.Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have been suffering on a daily basis. Commuters cannot get to work as buses have been erted. Shoppers have had to abandon some of the busiest streets. Businesses can’t get essential supplies. Emergency vehicles are unable to take the quickest routes. The blockades have cost London millions.Nobody denies the activists are committing a crime by obstructing the streets. Until yesterday, police could be found helping them by acting as picket-line cheerleaders and traffic controllers. We have been told the police presence hasn’t detracted from usual police business. Which of us believes that Excusing their behaviour because it is an important and righteous cause ignores the problem that we are setting a precedent.The liberal, metropolitan elite cheering on the protesters should be careful what they wish for. Paris has been convulsed by violent protests that began in a similar way. Failure to apply the law of obstruction when the Yellow Vest movement started has cost France dear.Others with cause to be angry about politics will have learned the lessons from Extinction Rebellion’s successful action.Remain-backing Londoners may feel very dferently about the taking over of public spaceLeave supporters annoyed at the failure to secure Brexit hit the streets in peaceful protest. But they will have only themselves to blame. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Support for this has grown in Parliament in recent months, in part because more MPs have become confident that Remain would come out on top.Butthe Brexit Party wins the European elections, it will show that another referendum would be anything but a cakewalk for Remain. This might make some of these MPs more inclined to compromise.One group whom a Farage victory won’t make more inclined to compromise are the Brexiteer holdouts against May’s deal. They’ll argue that his ­success proves that the public supports No Deal.But I suspect that what it would show more than anything  is voters’ frustration that Brexit hasn’t happened yet.It is the delay — that these MPs must take their share of the blame for — which is so infuriating the public.Success for the Brexit Party will come at the expense of the Tories more than any other party.Debate will quickly sht to how the Tories can win these voters back, and that will boost the chances of the ­Brexiteer leadership contenders. Indeed, theof Farage has already led to ToryMPs taking a second look at Boris Johnson. The other great question is, what effect will a win for the Brexit Party have on Labour The cross-party Brexit talks will resume next week, but those close to them hold out little hope of success.The sense is that they will, in the words of one source, “drag on for a while” but it is “unlikely they will reach agreement”.Butthe Brexit Party is ­taking votes from Labour in its traditional heartlands, it will strengthen the hand of those in the party who just want to get a Brexit deal done so the issue is off the stocks before the next election.Some in government admit that this is unlikely to happen, as doing a deal with Theresa May on Brexit would cause bitter isions in Labour’s ranks.They do hold out hope, though, that it might lead to more Labour MPs being ­prepared to back the deal — a mere five Labour MPs voted for the withdrawal agreement last month.But with the DUP and hardcore Brexiteers determined not to back the deal, it would require  or more Labour MPs to come over — which is a hard ask — for the deal to pass.Perhaps the most signicant consequence of a Brexit Party triumph is that it would finish off Farage’s old party, Ukip.Ukip’s flirtation with Tommy Robinson street thuggery and YouTube stars who make light of rape has been a disaster for the party.The electorate will simply have no truck with such extremist nonsense and so Ukip won’t be the beneficiaries of the public’s anger at the Brexit delays.IF any government needed a reboot, it is this one. But the problem for Theresa May is that doing that requires a Queen’s Speech, and that could bring down her government.Ministers worry that any Queen’s Speech would have to include within it the Brexit deal. After all, that would be the biggest piece of ­legislation going through Parliament in the ­coming session.Butit did, the Queen’s Speech may well be voted down. Labour and Tory Brexit rebels could get together to defeat the Government.As one source at the heart of government points out: “If you haven’t got the votes for the deal, why would you have the votes to pass the Queen’s Speech ”A Queen’s Speech would also require the ­Government to do another deal with the DUP – the current agreement only lasts for this session of Parliament.Given the way the two party leaderships have fallen out over Brexit, this won’t be easy.One ­Cabinet minister tells me that the Tory DUP ­relationship needs “completely resetting” and that it will be a “pretty fraught negotiation”. Butthe Government doesn’t do a Queen’s Speech, it will become embarrassingly obvious that it is in office but NOT IN POWER.The Commons won’t have any government ­legislation to discuss. Rather, it will have to fill its time with pointless general debates.As one ­secretary of state frets: “What legislation do we have to keep bringing forward ”The Tories need to show that despite the Brexit impasse, they do have ideas on domestic ­policy – and that is going to require a Queen’s Speech.DON’T hold your breath for any Tory leadership dream tickets.A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that any contest is now six months away and therefore don’t want to commit to backing a candidate now.One minister close to the efforts to broker a dream ticket tells me: “Everything could look very dferent in October, so what’s the point in ­signing up now ”So all those ­waiting to seeAmber Rudd teams up with Boris Johnson or Michael Gove are going to have to keep on waiting.WITH the Tories in existential crisis, where was the party ­chairman  Pakistan.Ministers were incredulous at the fact that with the party trying to prevent catastrophic losses in both local and European elections, and grassroots activists threatening a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister, Brandon Lewis was off to Pakistan.Allies of the chairman point out that he was only there for  hours and that the trip was part of a Tory effort to strengthen ­community ties.It’s right that the Tories should want to speak to British Pakistanis more.But Lewis would surely be better off doing that here rather than leaving the country with his party in crisis.BREXIT Britain should reach for the stars. We need to put rocket boosters under our space programme.As research from the think tank Policy Exchange’s new Space Policy Unit highlights, the UK spends ­considerably less on space than every other permanent member of the UN Security Council.With space’s strategic importance only going to grow in the coming years, this needs to changethe UK is not to be left behind.The good news is we have the technical expertise we need in this country.We now just need the Government to get behind a space ­programme and ensure that the UK doesn’t get left at the starting line in this new and more important race.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of them are free.Leaders from across our faith communities are standing together to speak out against slavery.Last year the Church of England and the Catholic Church launched the Safe Car Wash App to help drivers report slavery at car washes — one industry alone that’s thought to have thousands of enslaved workers.After just six months, users have reported over , suspected cases, helping the police to tackle this plague.In my own Diocese I know there is crucially important work going on to support these victims.At All Souls Church in Langham Place, at the heart of the West End, the charity Tamar provides essential support and advocacy by reaching out to women who are suffering through sexual exploitation.Tamar takes inspiration from the two stories of women in the Bible being badly mistreated by men and society,The appeal has built on the work of the Clewer Initiative, which has called for a community -wide response to modern slavery — developing partnerships between the Church, statutory and non-statutory agencies, to create a network of advocates seeking to end modern day slavery.As we celebrate the new le of Jesus Christ, let us remember that new le comes not just after death but for those that are living.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.This week’s devastation of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the remarkable demonstrations of solidarity and generosity that have emerged in its aftermath, are testament to the power of community and show the spirit of resurrection in action.If we could apply that same spirit to the terrible injustice of slavery in our communities, through working together, looking closely for what is hidden in plain sight, and supporting the excellent work of charities, we can give new le to those thousands of victims of modern slavery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I never went back in.” Weight had never been an issue for the Marks  Spencer section manager who adds that she ‘can’t even blame it on having children’. The mum from Aintree, Liverpool said: “It happened afterwards. I was working full-time and my husband Mark did shts so we had dferent work patterns, and we just started to rely more and more on convenience foods, takeaways, that sort of thing. “Some people say they pile on the weight, but with me it just snuck up on me. Every time I went to buy new clothes I was another size bigger. I used to cry and then walk out of the changing room and say something didn’t feel like me or the colour didn’t suit, but it was just far too small. “And I’d say I didn’t feel well, or I needed an early night because I had to get up early, anything to avoid going out anywhere. I hid myself away because I was so self-conscious about being overweight and I hated people staring at me or judging me.  “Mark used to try and encourage me by promising a new dress or suggesting somewhere nice, but I’d say no, so he’d go out – and I’d stay home and eat chocolate! I never admitted I was sad about my weight but I know he knew.” Sue’s weight soared and she went from a size - to a size . When she topped the scales at st lb, it began to take a massive toll on her health and well-being. Sue said: “My knees ached, my ankles ached, my back ached – and I walked with a limp because of my size. There were times when I got in from work and I slumped on the sofa because I couldn’t make it up the stairs. I was shattered and had no energy.“I’d say there was no point going to the doctor because he would just say it was my weight – but it was my weight! My cholesterol was nineand my blood pressure was high.”Sue’s daily intake started with sausage and egg on toast or a full English breakfast with everything fried, and sandwiches with crisps and chocolate for lunch. She added: Dinner would be pizza or an Indian takeaway with a rich and creamy sauce. “And I’d snack throughout the day on crisps and chocolate or treat myself to anything I wanted at work – I’d buy a whole rotisserie chicken and eat it, skin and all, on a barm cake or buy a ready meal and eat it with bread and chips. “For supper I’d have something on toast or any pizza that was left. I hated how I was – and yet I did nothing about it.”      But, when Sue’s daughter Laura announced she was pregnant and her granddaughter Holly was born, Sue realised she had to act. “I wanted to enjoy my granddaughter. My son Matthew has got two children, Savannah,  and Ethan, six, and I realised that I didn’t do nearly as much with them as I would have liked. I didn’t get the chance to look after them as much because of my weight. “I wasn’t as agile, I wasn’t as quick – I wasn’t as able. I struggled to keep up and carry them, or put them to bed, and I didn’t want this to happen with Holly. “I decided then to lose the weight. And I have.” Sue joined Slimming World in April  and has since seen her weight steadily decline from st lb to st lb. Now, her daily diet is a healthy breakfast of fruit lunch is a salad with ham, tuna or salmon, or a jacket potato with tuna or beans and dinner might be homemade burgers with chips , a curry, Scouse or a roast dinner. Since she lost the weight, Sue says she has far more energy an is happy to walk everywhere, go swimming or run around in the park.  “I walk for miles and back with Holly and it’s no effort at all - and I can do so much more with Savannah and Ethan too. I realise how much I missed out with them and I’m making up for lost time – we go swimming, I play football with them – I can do anything they want, and I want. “Ethan gets stickers at school for good work and when he saw my awards for each half-stone loss at Slimming World, he said he was going to tell his teacher that ‘my nan has got more stickers than Iaposve ever seen in my whole le’. “When my doctor saw me, he looked back at the notes and said he wasn’t sure he had the right person.” Sue said there is only one drawback to losing the weight and thataposs the fact that Marks  Spencer has had to keep replacing her unorm for smaller and smaller sizes and itaposs costing the company a fortune. She added: “I am so happy with le and loving being able to enjoy my three grandchildren. “I went to Center Parcs again recently with Laura and Holly and I couldn’t wait to get back down the Rapids ride, and this time nothing and no-one was going to stop me - especially not my weight.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit tories meltdown almost half","story":"NewsBrexit: Tories in meltdown as almost HALF of councillors set to vote for FarageAn eye-watering Survation poll shows just % of Tory councillors are planning to back their own party for the European ParliamentShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe full extent of the Tory mutiny against Theresa May has been exposed \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe full extent of the Tory Brexit meltdown has been exposed in a shock poll - which shows almost HALF of councillors are set to back Nigel Farage. Only % of Conservative councillors plan to vote for their own party in the EU elections, according to a damning Survation poll of  of them.And a whopping % said they plan to vote for the Brexit Party, the new outfit set up by Farage in direct opposition to the Tories. The survey reveals the depth of anger against Theresa May among grassroots Tories after she delayed Brexit to October , and opened cross-party talks that could lead to a softer deal.Some % of councillors said the Brexit deadlock damaged the party. And % want the Prime Minister to resign - with % saying she must go immediately. One councillor questioned in the study said: The Conservative Party is dead. It will take a strong leader to dredge it out of the mud.    The open revolt makes eye-watering reading for Theresa May as the Tories defend more than , of the , seats in local elections on May . Those town hall polls will then be followed by the European Parliament elections on May , where Nigel Farageaposs party is hoping to grab many of the  seats on offer - at the expense of both main parties. Todayaposs survey comes after the Tory group on Derbyshire County Council revealed it would not campaign for the party in the European elections. And other councillors are describing themselves as aposlocalapos Conservatives in order to distance themselves from the central party. Barry Lewis, who has led the Derbyshire authority since May , said: We were promised, following the largest public mandate a UK Government has ever received, that we would be out by March . The Prime Minister said we would be out by that date countless times, so did many others in Government.    And yet here we are racing towards the end of April and facing an increased prospect of participating in a European election in May that should not be happening. Writing in the Sunday , Mr Farage claimed millions of natural Tory voters have said emphatically that they will never vote Conservative again. He added: Far from being seen as the party to solve the EU question, the Tories are now actively regarded by a growing number of people as being a major part of the problem. Under Theresa Mayaposs stewardship, there has been near-anarchy on the Tory benches in Parliament for the past couple of years, as MPs have deliberately gone against the partyaposs manesto and done everything they can to thwart the referendum result. Her own chicanery makes it unclear whether she has merely tolerated this behaviour or encouraged it. Tory activists fear a drubbing in the elections that will pile pressure on Theresa May to stand down.    Reports emerged today of a fresh plot to oust Mrs May by June  by changing party rules, to allow more than once leadership challenge per year. Sir Graham Brady of backbenchersapos  Committee will meet her this week and say % of Tory MPs want her to resign, according to the Sunday Times. A survey of , Tory members by the ConservativeHome website found % want Mrs May to quit. With Mrs May promising to stand down once her Brexit deal is passed, the Conservatives are already in a full-blown leadership contest in all but name. Jeremy Hunt, Amber Rudd, Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid and Dominic Raab are among senior figures upping their profile ahead of a party contest. Todayaposs Survation poll found a higher proportion, %, would back the Tories in EU electionsBoris Johnson was leader and Prime Minister.    Mr Johnson was backed by % as the best leader, followed by Michael Gove on %, Jeremy Hunt on %, Sajid Javid on % and Dominic Raab on %. Survation questioned  Tory councillors between April  and  on behalf of the Mail on Sunday. Some % said Mrs May should resign now and % once a Brexit deal has been reached - the timetable the Prime Minister has indicated for her departure. As an extension to the Brexit process has been granted until October, the UK is obliged to elect  MEPs to the European Parliament. They will sit from July  until Britain leaves on October  - or when the Withdrawal Agreement is ratied in the Commons. But EU chiefs have signalled they will be willing to delay Brexit again.

If you just walk away from Europe, the complications are immense. There’s a very integrated manufacturing process with us and Europe. Many of our factories rely on just-in-time deliveries from Europe and deliver to Europe on a just-in-time basis. If that is disrupted there are massive problems.”    Mr Corbyn also said he plans to “heal” Britain by bringing both sides of the fractured country together around his Brexit deal. And he told of his frustration at the slow pace of talks. He said: “Parliament has to modernise. The interesting thing about the Brexit debates is that Parliament has asserted itself, stepping up to control the timetable. “Because of Brexit there are more people watching Parliament than ever before. That’s a good thing but the rituals and the language are alien to most of the country.” Mr Corbyn also said he hoped for more progress on the representation of women and BAME in the Labour Party, housing, crime, schools, the environment and homelessness.  It comes after a top Labour peer told The Mirror that Nigel Farageaposs new party aposposed a very serious threatapos to Labour. Lord Maurice Glasman said the newly-founded group was a risk to his partyvoters felt Labour had ignored the result of the  referendum and backed a second vote. Lord Glasman said the Brexit Party would “capture the rage of people who feel like their democratic vote had been disregarded”. Issuing the warning at a  organised by Labour Leave, he urged the party not to “sneer” at people who voted to quit the bloc.

While Theresa May was off strolling in Snowdonia, the Labour leader was pounding the campaign trail up north, where the effects of years of cuts and deprivation are plain to see. Before lunchtime on Monday, he had done  separate media interviews, fired a bow and arrow and delivered a speech in a cricket club that was opened in  by Red Rum. But the -year-old party boss was more than happy to leave London behind and hit the road. Mind you, to be fair, he has never really been OFF the road. Last week it was Wales and ­Plymouth. Before that, Scotland.  As he paused for breath on his whistle-stop trip to the north, he said: “We live in a wonderful country. “I love every part of it, I’m fascinated about our history, why places are where they are, how they came to be. “Everywhere you go you see the contributions people make in dferent ways. I love it all, the ersity, the open air, the wildle. It’s the changes to places as well – their rebirth. “Nothing is set for ever. Austerity has destroyed a generation. “The future for this country is about making sure our young people don’t grow up thinking they’re going to be worse off than their parents. “They’re going to have the healthcare, education, pensions, available. It’s about investing in them.” This leg of the tour started in ­Yorkshire before heading over to Lancashire, Cheshire and finishing at a teachers’ conference in Liverpool. Mr Corbyn said: “I enjoy coming to the north, it means a lot to me. People talk to each other in a way they don’t in London. There’s an openness about discussion and debate. “There’s also a real determination to do things. The landscape is beautul, the towns and cities. “But there’s a sadness about it as well. The deindustrialisation, the lack of replenishment and good quality jobs. We want to change all that.”    For the first part of the leg, focusing on crime and youth services, he was joined by shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott . They headed to Sunnybank Youth Centre in the Calder Valley, to meet volunteer staff and youngsters. The Labour leader watched kids give an archery demonstration before firing arrows with ying success. The youngsters then tried to talk him into a go on the climbing wall. One staffer said: “He did it on another visit. It was jacket off and up there in seconds. You can’t stop him.” But this time he resisted. After a round of media interviews, the tour moved on to the Elland Cricket, Athletic and Bowling Club, opened – as mentioned –  years ago by treble Grand National winner Red Rum.There was a crowd of , which considering it was Monday lunchtime, freezing, and had only been advertised a couple of days ago, was brilliant. Bowlers playing a game outside showed little interest. Though, to be fair, you could have had Churchill, Gandhi and JFK handing out free John Smith’s in there and they would have played another end. The speech went down well. The pledge to stand against racism and anti-Semitism got a round of a applause, as did the few words from Diane Abbott, who revealed her mum used to be a nurse in Huddersfield. As people filed out, volunteers tried to get them to come door-knocking. There were mixed results, from the blunt “I can’t” and the plausible “There’s no one to watch the kids” to the inexplicable, but hard to argue with, “I’m from Todmorden”. Out and about, very little national stuff comes up. If it is mentioned, it’s that the voters are fed up of it. Mr Corbyn, who was joined by local council elections candidate Victoria Porritt, said: “The real isions are about poverty, wealth and oppor-tunity. Even those families that are apparently quite well off face stresses. “They can’t get homes for their ­children, their kids are going to university and racking up great debt, or they can’t get apprenticeships.”  During the doorstepping session he met -year-old Freya Van-De-Gevel, who had just moved back to the area. Freya said: “There was more to do when we were kids but it’s gone and transport’s not great. It feels cut off.” Back in the car, Mr Corbyn got on with preparing for a speech later that day to teachers in Liverpool. “Anything interesting ” I asked. “We’re going to get rid of SATs.” Quite interesting. Dinner was an Indian meal in ­Blackburn with local ­politicians, friends and the chairman of the Lancashire Beekeeping Association. I got a report in the morning . Tuesday started with a meeting in Leyland, Lancs. It is by no means the Bronx but residents are concerned about anti-social behaviour. Retired bobby Brian Derbyshire said when he worked in nearby Bolton there were  cops in the town centre at any time. He said: “There was a lad on the beat here, then he was replaced by a PCSO in a car. That’s not what we need.”  Local Tom Downey said he felt sorry for youngsters there because they were ”generally really good kids” but so many things have closed down. In Winsford, Cheshire, The Red Lion was packed for another speech from Mr Corbyn, who even drew the raffle. On his way to the next door-knocking session he talked of education, saying: “When a fth of teachers say they’re going to quit that is a clear warning.” Another issue is HS. Mr Corbyn said: “We supported HS to make rail in the country better. More investment should be going into railways in the north rather than the south-east.” In the car to Liverpool we ran through the last two days that had seen a whirl of speeches, meetings, selfies and travel. “I love it,” he said. “I don’t get tired. You learn something everywhere you go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"saira khan what greater sign","story":"NewsopinionSaira Khan: What greater sign do we need to prove climate change is real Its very nice to be enjoying hot weather in April but take a moment to think why you are managing to do thatShareCommentsBySaira Khan:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsopinionProtests by groups such as Extinction Rebellion may cause traffic jams but it is just a small price to pay for highlighting the issue of climate change \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBare ­bottoms squashed up against a window in the House of Commons was my introduction to ­Extinction Rebellion.Their pants are back on now but these climate change protesters are definitely getting their message out there. “System change not climate change,” their banners say, while they sprawl all over the capital, bringing roads to a standstill.

We need to be changing our whole society – the way we eat, shop, produce, travel. The way we live and think. It might sound overwhelming and unreasonable, but  years ago the concept of crushing up a cola can to recycle it seemed a bit crazy. We do need to be flying less, not jumping on a flight for stag parties and city breaks.  And, yes, it’s very nice to be enjoying hot weather in April. But while you’re grilling your sausages on the barbecue, take a moment to think why you are managing to do that. We are moving in the right direction and tech is helping, allowing people to work from home, rather than travel.

Michael Gove made my blood boil when he said, “wrap up the demos, politicians get the message”. He doesn’t. Our MPs get more fired up about the plastic in their wallet than the plastic in the sea.

The pedigrees are used relentlessly as puppy-making machines and some end up being sold to the dog meat trade when no longer fertile. One horried racing trainer said he stopped exporting to China after seeing a video of a dog being thrown alive into boiling water. We can reveal that instead of enjoying a loving home, retired animals are sold off for tens of thousands of pounds. They are then exported to centres to produce puppies for the multi-million pound illegal racing industry. With prices of up to £, per litter, male dogs have sperm repeatedly extracted and even frozen so breeders can cash in on the dogs’ success years after they die.    Our probe indicates that at least  former racing dogs from the UK and Ireland are currently caged in China. One animal rights activist who alerted us to the sickening trade said: “These beautul creatures are being treated as a commodity. “After running around a track for years on end they are sent to a country where animal welfare laws are lax. They are completely sucked dry. “What’s scary is the lack of animal welfare in China - any chancer can stump up the money for the pedigree and use the dog as a money-spinner with no obligation to its care. “People think of retired greyhounds living out a slow, comfy le on the sofa but for these unlucky ones, the reality is far more brutal.”    While not illegal, exporting greyhounds to countries with poor animal rights protection such as China has been slammed by campaigners as “abhorrent and unethical”. They say dogs can develop health and behavioural problems, with some ex-racers dying at the facilities. Our investigation uncovered adverts picturing  former UK racers at the Asian centres along with their racing cards and microchip details. Two, Frisby Barney and Droopy’s Dale, have been rescued. Both were trained in Ireland and raced in the UK. Sadly two others, including one which raced  times at a prestigious track, are believed to be dead.  Kerry Lawrence of Birmingham Greyhound Protection helps ­co-ordinate rescues of ex-racing dogs. She said conditions inside the Chinese facilities are bleak, with dogs taken from their cages at least every other day to produce sperm. Kerry said: “My volunteers have told me about filthy cages, malnutrition and poor bedding. The greyhounds’ muscles shrink from lack of exercise, with no walks and just a shared outdoor paddock as the toilet. They are hellish places. “The dogs are nothing more than puppy producers, receiving no love or attention.” Hooked to catheters, males produce sperm which is used for articial insemination or frozen.  In other instances, male and female dogs are held in position for up to three hours as handlers try to get them to mate. Kerry said: “The methods aren’t necessarily cruel or inhumane, but the relentless approach, shocking lack of care and grim circumstances surrounding the process are.” But there was good news this week as Kerry told of the rescue of two gentle creatures. Ex-champ Frisby Barney – who raced at nine British stadiums and set the track record at the Peterborough Derby in  – was saved.  The Irish-bred dog was shipped to a breeding kennel near Beijing, north-east China in . He is believed to have sired thousands of puppies. Kerry raised £, to secure Frisby’sand he landed in the UK on April . A team of volunteers from her charity in China – Candy Cane Rescue – bought Frisby for £, after verying his ear tattoo and microchip. A further £, went on flights and vet bills. British vets had to castrate the eight-year-old dog after his testicles shrivelled after years of breeding. He was severely underweight, covered in sores and  of his  teeth were removed due to rotting. Kelly said: “Frisby was held in extremely high regard during his racing career and worth thousands, but once in China they used and abused him. He was in a horrendous state, it broke my heart.”  It is understood a third party took him to China, as Frisby Barney’s former owner said this week he sold the retired greyhound to an American buyer five years ago. He he was shown pictures of the buyer’s dogs and kennels prior to the sale, saying: “They looked to be in outstanding condition. “I had no issue at the time. If it is true, I’m sad to hear about this.” After hearing Frisby was back the UK the former owner contacted Frisby’s buyer and said: “He informed me that Frisby Barney was stolen and a police investigation is going on.” An Irish racer called Droopy’s Dale, who also raced in the UK, was rescued from the same grim kennel in December at a cost of £, plus flights and vet bills. The dog was trained at Droopy’s Stud in Ballyvalican, Co Waterford. Director Sean Murphy said he and his brother Michael had sold six dogs in  to a man based in Hong Kong.  They immediately stopped selling animals to China after seeing a horrying video of another racing dog being thrown into boiling water around five years ago. Sean said he knew dogs had been found but did not know Droopy’s Dale was one of them. He said: “A number of years ago a fellow approached us to buy dogs. “We get fellas looking for dogs from us from all over the world – Portugal, Brazil, France, Germany. They went through the department to get their papers in order. We were assured that they would be [looked after]. “But.. It started appearing on the internet that the dogs were ill-treated, certain dogs, not our dogs, not that we knew of anyway. “I saw a live dog on a video being put into boiling water. Who does that to be honest  When that happened then that was the end of [selling to] China. “We didn’t know who [the dogs] were owned by but the video appeared and that was the end of it. “We haven’t exported to China in four or five years since. We rear them and breed them and look after them and do as well as we can with them. “We’d like to think anybody would do the same. I wouldn’t like that to happen to any dog. If it happened to be ours it makes it worse.” Michael and Rita James, who run non-profit organisation Campaign Against Greyhound Exploitation and Deathknow of at least a dozen Chinese breeding centres after tip-offs from whistleblowers. The couple have worked with Kerry for two years.  Michael said: “These beautul creatures, some with muzzles duct-taped, in grim-looking facilities, reduced to money-spinning commodities.” One dog is said to have been exported to China after breaking its legs while racing at a UK track. Michael said puppies are sold for around  Yuan – around £ each –they have racing potential. Although China’s last greyhound stadium, the Canidrome in Macau, closed last year, campaigners believe at least  illegal racetracks operate in the country.  Greyhound racing is the sixth most popular spectator sport in the UK, with  regulated tracks. Rita, who set up a petition signed by , people so far, added: “We may never get back the beautul dogs sent to be abused overseas, but we can introduce legislation to make sure it doesn’t happen to any others.” Find Rita’s petition by searching for “say no to all live greyhound exports” at Change.org Donate to Birmingham Greyhound Protection at birminghamgreyhoundprotection.org Racing bodies aposabhor crueltyapos Regulatory body The Greyhound Board of Great Britain pledged its commitment to dog welfare – including retired ones – a year ago. Responding to our probe, GBGB said it could only intervenehanded evidence one of its licence holders directly sent a greyhound to China. While there is no ban on exporting there, the body said it would crack down for animal welfare reasons. It said: “Our remit covers the racing le of a greyhound and its entry into what we would hope and expect is a long, healthy retirement. “Unfortunately it does not extend beyond this. “So, , for example, a retired greyhound is then sold on to a third partyand then exported to China, we have neither the remit to regulate this nor the ability to intervene.” It added the GBGB abhors cruelty to greyhounds and has strict guidelines on animal welfare. In the UK, owners of registered racing greyhounds must inform the GBGB when retiring their dog. It says the vast majority become pets. CAGED is calling for GBGB and the Irish Greyhound Board to make exports illegal – with an exception for legitimate animal charities. The IGB said: “We are aware of reports suggesting horric cruelty to greyhounds in China and condemn such appalling practices in the highest possible terms”. It added it is rolling out a digital database to “track” racing dogs from registration onwards and is working with the Irish government as part of its Greyhound Industry Bill, which seeks to ensure the dogs’ welfare.

Not content to continue being sad, the nine-year-old asked her mumshe could change schools and, when she did, found she fit in an awful lot better.  In a bid to celebrate her new found happiness and to encourage others to look after their mental health, Evannah has made a video about her story. Since her mum Kara posted it on social media it has received hundreds of comments and likes from wellwishers. Evannah tells her story through through a number of cards she has written on.    I started having bad dreams, the first notice, propped on a curled up Evannah, explains. I needed a cuddle during the night. Mum said Iaposd be okay. I was feeling very lonely and isolated.    Evannah then explains how she withdrew from her parents and began relying on dancing as an outlet. It wasnapost enough for the young girl however, who became increasingly miserable during term time. The situation came to an unfortunate head one day when Evannah was approached by a girl in the school bathrooms.Kara told the Mail Online : Evannah experienced an awful incident where the toilet was opened from the other side, to be confronted and confined in a small space with another girl. aposThis was the last straw for me and I begged her to go. Again, she wouldnapost because she was scared to make the move to another school in case all girls were the same.    After attempting to fit in for a further two months Evannah was tipped over the edge by a miserable week. She asked her mum to find her a new school, which Kara had done within a week. Since leaving her old classmates behind Evannah has become much more confident and happy, and even helped out a girl who was having trouble with boys in the year above.    I didnapost leave school because I was scared, Evannah continues in the video. I didnapost leave because I was sad. I didnapost leave because they said I was ugly. I didnapost leave because Iaposm worthless. I left because my mental health is worth more. Since moving schools Evannah has realised she is strong, super honest and kinda funny. The video ends with her asking:Iaposll always be your friends.

Prince Harry ’s advisers are working on a “bespoke” role for the “royal rock stars”, probably in Africa that will combine some work on behalf of the Commonwealth along with charity work and a role promoting Britain, the Sunday Times states. The plan has been drawn up by Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to the US and special adviser on constitutional and international affairs to William and Harry. The new job would give Harry and Meghan the chance to enjoy a break from recent isions in the royal household that have dogged their marriage while also giving them the opportunity to make use of their global appeal and popularity. The paper adds the role could take the couple away from the UK for two to three years, though notes aposdiscussions are at an early stageapos.   The decision on where they would be based is unlikely to be taken until  when they have settled down with their new baby, the paper said. Harry has close links to several African countries and has visited the continent since his teens. He spent his gap year in Lesotho in  and started a charity there two years later. He and Meghan are believed to have fallen in love with the country that Harry referred to as “his second home” and where they ed for Meghan’s th birthday in . South Africa and Malawi are also being considered as options. Senior royal officials are keen to find a permanent role for Harry as Prince Wlliam starts preparing to be king.    They want to keep Harry and Meghan as part of the “royal firm” rather than letting them pursue their own projects such as a planned TV series on mental health with Oprah Winfrey. The Africa project took shape after a proposal to make Harry governor-general or deputy governor general of Australia or Canada was dismissed as impractical. Palace insiders say a role was devised that would take them away from Britain for two or three years. “Discussions are at an early stage but the plan is to find a new way of using their soft power abilities, most likely in Africa,” a source told the newspaper.

Many believe the start of a full moon, like the one we saw last night, can induce labour. They believe the full moonaposs gravitational pull can affect the amniotic fluid which surrounds the baby. One fan wrote: Tomorrow is the full moon and also exactly  months Harry and Meghan wed in Windsor I think it would be the best day for baby Sussex to present himself into the world. According to the Royal Museums Greenwich, the full Moon was set to reach its peak little after noon, at .pm, though it would not be easy to see until dusk.  It occurs when the Moon is located on the opposite side of the Earth as the Sun, meaning its face is fully illuminated. Meghan and Harry revealed they wouldnapost be sharing key details earlier this month, a decision which has split fans. While many agreed with their decision, some are disappointed that they wonapost be sharing the excitement. Commentator Carole Malone said she didnapost understand why they couldnapost spend two miserly minutes outside the hospital waving and smiling at people who only want to wish them well. Speaking on Sky News she said: There we all were looking forward to the arrival of baby Sussex and boom Meghan and Harry make the announcement that there will no announcement.    Someone needs to explain to me how a statement announcing the baby’s name, weight and gender, would invade their privacy or deny them precious family time. This is an unprecedented slap in the face for those legions of decent ordinary people who love the Royal Family and who see the Royal birth as a joyous, national celebration. No one is expecting Meghan to parade her baby minutes after giving birth, and, of course, they’re entitled to private time with the Baby Sussex.

Last week the Home Secretary said growing up on Bristol’s Stapleton Road could have turned him to crime.So the Sunday People paid a visit to find out what the locals thought. Seconds after arriving outside his childhood home a dealer offered us crack cocaine. Druggies puffed crack and cannabis without a care in the world while I was harassed to buy every  yards. One woman who sleeps on the street told us: “Is it rough here  Are you mad ”    A pub shut after police busted a drug smuggling gang. A paedophile ring was on the same road. And a murder. Locals blasted Mr Javid for using his background as political currency as he angles for the top job – while doing nothing for those still there. They say the only time they see the millionaire is stage managed interviews about his tough childhood. In , he arrived in a chauffeur-driven Jaguar to visit the two-bed flat above the clothes shop where he lived with his parents and four brothers. Mr Javid went back last October and posed for pictures in a cafe where he used to play pinball. Paul Westlick, , who has recently found a home after  years on the streets, said: “Javid, we are begging you to do something about the place you used to call home. “My friends are on the street. We have been abandoned. No one is fighting for us.” Another local said: “Sajid’s got a nerve talking about crime here. “He’s in a position to do something about it but nothing changes. What hope have we got ”   Local police have lost  officers since  because of cuts by Mr Javid’s Home Office predecessor Theresa May .And Mr Javid’s Tories have cut £million. Shop worker Sam said: “It’s a dangerous area. There are loads of criminals. Every day police are here but there’s not enough of them.” Another warned: “Don’t walk on your own here at night and stay away from the drug dealers. “They pressurise young girls to cut coke and crack for them. Your home will be turned into a crack den.” One drug gang on the street ran The Coach House pub, where a £.million cannabis and ecstasy smuggling operation was busted three years ago. The licensee and two other men were jailed for a total of more than  years. The ex-owner of another pub, the Black Swan, was sent down for hiding knives used to kill a man last year. The pub’s barman Nathan Newell, , whose uncle now runs it, told us: “Is it the most dangerous street in Britain  I think it is. There’s stabbings, robberies, shootings, drugs, human trafficking. You name it.”    Meanwhile, a gang of Somali sex abusers was caged after a girl escaped from captivity on Stapleton Road. Thirteen men were jailed for a total of  years in . The street is in the Lawrence Hill ward in Easton, among the most deprived two per cent in England. Half of all the children there live in poverty. Parents struggle to raise kids amid burnt buildings, smashed windows, drunks and pavements strewn with syringes and used condoms. Mother-of-five Mel Girland, , said: “It’s a scandal that Javid has left this area to rot while he’s using his upbringing as political capital. “We have had no heating since December and we have a problem with rats. We’ve been forgotten about. At night I have carried a kne on the way back from my job in Poundland.” Local shopkeepers believe council cuts are part of the problem.    Shopkeeper Abdul Ismail said: “The council aren’t looking after the area but it’s not their fault as they are stretched. It hasn’t been cleaned up for  years.” When asked what the solution was, he said: “They need bobbies on the street and bin collections. Not more cuts.” Crisis charity worker Steve Baker – who helps run a drop-in centre for the homeless – said: “This area is one of the most deprived in England. And there’s been massive cuts to the police and local government. That’s something the Home Secretary needs to address. “We don’t just get the homeless, we get people who have finished their sht at Tesco or on lunch come in for a free meal in their unorm and they shouldn’t have to do that as they have a job.” Latest figures show violent crime is up by four per cent in the area. In February there were  crimes, including  violent or sexual. But Avon and Somerset Police has to make £ million in savings by , said its independent Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens. She said: “We have reached the point where enough is enough and policing in Avon and Somerset cannot be stretched any further.”    Community leaders in Bristol said the area he grew up in had improved a lot in the last  years. Mohammed Elshar said: “Stapleton Road is the real Bristol. It is a vibrant area in the city made up of a mix of dferent nationalities, races and religions all living and working together. “The real issues are about equal employment, education and opportunities for young people. “A lot of work has been taking place in the community to tackle those issues and make sure our young people can contribute in a meaningful way. “It’s insulting to still hear Stapleton Road being described as the most dangerous place when I just don’t think that’s the case any more.” Mr Javid moved from Bristol in his late teens to study at university. He then worked in banking, becoming a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank aged  before entering Parliament. In a speech last week, Mr Javid, , said: “There were pupils at my school who shoplted and they asked meI wanted to help. There were drug addicts who stood near my school gates and told me thatI joined in, I too could make some easy money. “But I was lucky. I had loving and supporting parents who gave me the security that I needed. I had some brilliant teachers who motivated me and took me much further than I think even they expected.” The Home Office said last night: “The Home Secretary lived on Stapleton Road around  years ago. Although he remembers it as a challenging neighbourhood he recalls it fondly. “He has made clear his personal commitment to tackling crime, wherever it occurs. The Government announced an increase of over £billion in police funding this year. “Avon and Somerset will receive more than £million in - including council tax, an increase of £.million on -.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant woman family refused pizzaexpress","story":"NewsPregnant woman and family REFUSED PizzaExpress entry because theyre travellersChick Wilson and her family were refused entry at the Italian chain in Doncaster for being travellersShareCommentsByEd McConnell:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video just-because-were-travellers-cant-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:[ REV- ],video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBosses at PizzaExpress have been blasted after a pregnant woman and her family were refused entry at one of the chainaposs restaurants because they are travellers.

It was shockingly pricey, though, more than £ a day, but private health insurance paid. Wealthy celebs coughed up a fortune for rehab and the US sent traumatised servicemen based in Europe for treatment.

In the years since, I’ve met several people with very ­dferent experiences and professionals with real concern about falling standards.

An inquest later found a catalogue of errors and neglect involving untrained staff. And now the Priory Group has ­admitted guilt in Amy’s death and been fined £,. Her mother Tania says the firm is ­“morally bankrupt” for putting “profit before safety.”    And she rightly asks why the Priory Group, which made operating profits of £.million in , is still getting paid millions of pounds to treat NHS patients.

Yet the Priory Group gets paid ­£million in contracts from local ­authorities and the NHS.

As little girls they spent all their spare time ballet dancing. But the passion that once united them has now ripped them apart. For Leah became anorexic in her quest to become a professional ballerina. Now , she weighs just over five stone and her le is in danger. And Anna is making a final ­heart-rending plea to her twin to start eating before it is too late. “I want my old sister back,” she said. “We used to have so much fun. “Leah and I were so close when we were little. Our love of dancing ­cemented that relationship but now I’m frightened the one thing we both loved will kill her. “I’m sure it was her determination to be the best ballerina possible that actually caused her to end up with an eating disorder. It has taken my once happy and bubbly sister away. “I imagined we would always be together. It breaks my heart there is a very real chance that won’t happen. “I’m frightened thatLeah doesn’t get better she won’t be here for much longer.”    The twins, from Barnsley, South Yorks, began dancing when they were aged three, progressing through the ranks until they were both accepted to train at the prestigious Royal School of Ballet in London. Until she was , Leah – who by her sister’s own ­admission was a more ­naturally talented dancer than her – was perfectly healthy. Anna said: “Looking back I can see now how it started. Leah strived to be the best dancer she possibly could. “There is a huge amount of pressure on dancers to be thin. Competition to be the best is fierce. “I think Leah saw losing weight as a way of making it to the top. “It started with us both going for a gentle jog but ended in Leah physically not being able to keep still. Evenwe were at home, she would constantly do burpees or handstands.    “At first I couldn’t understand why Leah just wouldn’t eat. I would get angry with her as I could see how much she was upsetting Mum and Dad. They were out of their minds with worry. “For the first time in our lives we would shout at one another. As Leah’s illness took hold she would physically attack meI criticised her. “It was just awful. She was no longer the sister I loved with all my heart.” Their mother booked Leah a GP appointment and the doctor weighed her at less than five stone. With a seriously underweight BMI of . – anything under . is classed as underweight – Leah was referred to the community mental health team and started on a meal plan, ­supplemented with calorie shakes. But she refused to accept that ­anything was wrong with her and started ­exercising even more. Unable to gain weight, she was admitted to the Becton Centre in Sheffield, a unit for adolescents with mental health issues, including eating disorders, and was fed with a nasal tube – which she hated. Anna, who is now at university studying dance, added: “It was the first day we had ever spent time apart and I felt like I’d lost my right arm. I just wanted her to get better. “I was studying a lot so couldn’t see Leah every day but would always FaceTime her from her phone and plead with her to get better.”  Leah spent the next four years in and out of dferent clinics, ­sometimes making progress. But as soon as she gained weight, her obsession with ­losing it began again. When she was , Leah split up with her boyfriend. The upset became the catalyst that sent her into a downward spiral of cutting out meals. She finally stopped eating in February  and was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. At the same time Leah developed an obsession with cleaning. During her spells with her family she would spend hours scrubbing the ­already immaculate family home. Anna said: “Just trying to have a family dinner became horrically stressful. Leah wouldn’t sit down until she had washed the kitchen worktops over and over again. “She actually rubbed the sheen off the granite and wiped the microwave so much that the numbers wore off.” Leah said: “I feel so sad that I can’t follow my dreams. I watch Anna and see how well she is doing and just wish I could take control of my le. “My biggest dream is to get better so I can be happy like my sister.” During our interview Leah was ­unable to keep still. “I just can’t help it,” she said while continually rising up and down on to the tips of her toes, her years of ballet dance training still evident. “I really want to get better. I want to go to college and train to be a lawyer and have a normal le but I don’t know how to take control of my illness.” The girls’ mother Lisa Gray, , said: “She is like this constantly. I need to go back to work next week as I’ve had far too much time off but I’m frightened of leaving her alone.” Leah, who is still being monitored by her local mental health team, has been referred to three dferent eating disorder clinics but is waiting to seeshe will be accepted as an in-patient. Her illness has been a massive strain for her distraught parents Lisa and Michael Senior, , a joiner. They raise money for Beat, the charity for those with eating disorders.  Lisa said: “To have identical twin girls who I could dress the same, who loved pretty things and dancing was just perfect for me. “I envisaged watching them grow up, ­becoming beautul young women, getting married and having children of their own. “Now I have no idea what tomorrow holds let alone whether Leah will ever be well enough to have ­children one day. “I literally have to take one day at a time. The ­future is so uncertain. “All I know is there is a very real chance that I could lose Leah and all my hopes and dreams as a parent will be utterly broken. “One daughter is pursuing her dreams and another may lose everything she ever dreamed of. “Overnight Leah went from eating normally, ­enjoying a McDonald’s once a week, to becoming obsessive about exercise and cutting out carbohydrates and anything with an ounce of fat. “Both girls always had quite slight frames but suddenly Leah was painfully thin. Her periods had stopped and her tiny size  clothes were hanging off her. “Lisa added that the health ­service’s support for adults who suffer from eating disorders was minimal. “The emphasis is on us as a family to help her but we aren’t the experts. I can’t make my little girl better,” Lisa said. “Without out the specialised help she desperately needs, the very realistic ­consequence is she will die.” “All the help she has been offered is one hour a week at a clinic  miles away in Sheffield and weekly contact with an ­occupational therapist and dietician.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather easter sunday set","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Easter Sunday set to be a scorcher as mercury could top CHeatwave sent home tourism figures soaring with more than , expected to visit Cornwall, , in Brighton and , in Blackpool and BournemouthShareCommentsByJohn Kelly:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBrits, including those on Ainsdale Beach, have been enjoying a period of gorgeous Easter weather \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Balmy Britain is officially hotter than Hawaii with some of the best Easter weather in  years — and Easter Sunday might even be a record.Forecasters say the mercury could top Ctomorrow in places, with soaring temperatures sending families scurrying to the seaside under cloudless blue skies.

Everything from multi-packs of cup-a-soups to ready-meal curries and chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate.Poundland is one of Britainaposs most popular cut-price stores and Europeaposs biggest single-price discounter, with more than  outlets around the country. But even though it sells a large range of food options - plus cleaning products, dog toys, DVDs and all in between - can you actually live off only eating at Poundland.Hull Live  reporter  Anna Riley  gave the challenge a go, and this is what she found... What I bought Admittedly, I havenapost really shopped at Poundland before. Other than popping my head in there to see what it was all about when the brand of discount stores launched, I havenapost been in since. Itaposs not like I want to pay over the odds for my goods - itaposs just that I tend to just stick to Aldi or Lidl for my weekly shop, and have also started shopping at my local greengrocers and butchers for my fruit and veg and meat. So when I was set the challenge of buying items wholly from Poundland for my weekly food shop, I didnapost really know what to expect and I thought Iaposd be forced to live off tinned goods - a prospect that I wasnapost remotely thrilled about. But when I tentatively stepped through the doors of Poundland at Kingston Retail Park, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was more feasible to do a grocery shop there than I imagined.  As well a range of dferent products from fizzy drinks to pasta and cleaning products, there was a small amount of fresh food available including fruit, packet ham and chicken, sausages, bacon, sausage rolls, pork pies, and sandwiches as well as cheese, bread, milk, desserts and even butter. As I didnapost know what food Iaposd be able to buy, I hadnapost really put together a shopping list so it was a case of deciding on the spot what to get for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the week. There was a range of breakfast options from Kelloggaposs cereals to porridge, croissants and cereal bars. I went for granola and eggs, and also saw that golden syrup, peanut butter and marmite were also on offer as well as tea and coffee.    I normally try to eat quite healthily, so bagged myself as much fresh produce as possible and loaded up my small shopping cart with strawberries, grapes, milk, cheese, Warburtons bread and packet chicken. I also wanted some healthy snacks, so bought apricots, cashew nuts, mango strips, Frusili bars and wholegrain rice cakes. I thought I could make tuna or salmon sandwiches for lunch so stocked up on the tinned fish and bought some Hellmannaposs light mayo and bags of crisps and chocolate bars to go with them.  Looking at all the other goods on the shelf, I saw that they were mostly branded and stocked up on a four pack of Heinz soup, Bacheloraposs super noodles and Ambrosia rice pudding and custard.  I also popped energy drinks in my basket that were on offer, along with juice, and treated myself to some Bounty hot chocolate. It wasnapost always the best value I found that even though Poundland is among the cheapest for branded food and drink, it wasnapost always the best value. This is because there are often cheaper deals going at the supermarket when items are on offer, such as discounts on tinned goods that mean items are cheaper than the £ to £ that I was spending on goods in Poundland.  I also felt a bit sucked in by the offers that were on, such as two rice puddings or packet noodles for the price of £ or three for £, as I would sooner have just bought the one tin for p, but that wasnapost an option. So in this sense, I spent more than I wanted to, and more than I would have done at the supermarket where I could have bought the items inidually. One lunchtime I was also out of the office all day and couldnapost heat up the soup I brought with me anywhere, so I went to Poundland in the Prospect Centre to seethey had any meal deals on, as they do in other supermarkets. Alas, there were only a few ieties of limp looking sandwiches to choose from, plenty of fizzy drinks to go at but not a bottle of water in sight, no fruit packs and the only optionI wanted to buy crisps was a multipack.  I ended up spending £ on my grab and go lunch from there, but I was disappointed with the egg and bacon sandwich I went for, which lacked in filling and was mainly crust, but couldnapost complain about the drink and crisps I went for. However, I did yearn for the wider meal deals on offer at supermarkets such as Tesco, where pasta, salad, wraps and even sushi are on offer along with crisps, fruit, chocolate and a drink for the same price that I paid at Poundland, showing that the value again wasnapost that great. I resisted the grip of poundmania...JUST  Wandering around, it was hard not to be gripped with the apositaposs only a poundapos mania and come out with half a ton of plastic tat as well as the food shop, along with enough surplus tinned goods to keep me going through the zombie apocalypseit ever happens. But I just about managed to resist. Along with the food, there were plenty of affordable toiletries and cleaning products, along with garden supplies and cute homewares including fake plants, trinkets and even mirrors to adorn your house with. There was also LOADS of chocolate in the run up to Easter, with a section of an isle dedicated to the holiday and filled with crafts and porcelain bunnies and baskets for a proper egg hunt. The food didnapost stay fresh for long  Sadly the fruit that I bought didnapost stay fresh for long at all. I tried to eat my strawberries a day after I ate them, but alas, I only managed to scoff around four from the whole punnet as the others had stared to go squishy and were on the turn, so I had to throw them in the bin. The grapes didnapost fare well either, and the chicken that I bought had a very short best before date, so I had to eat it the next day before it went off as well. Happily at least the eggs, milk and cheese had a longer shelf le and I froze the bread to keep it fresh. Meal planning was a challenge The challenge of what to cook, without being able to use fresh vegetables, little meat, and tinned fish was all too apparent when I tried to plan my meals for the week. I decided to have cereal every morning for breakfast and tuna, cheese and salmon sandwiches, soup or noodles for lunch along with chicken, and had a combination of eggs with toast and either soup or noodles for tea, with a iety of chocolate, crisps, dried fruits, cereal bars, rice pudding and rice cakes to accompany the meals.  Itaposs not like I really like cooking that much, but I do prefer to eat something wholesome, and I found opening tins and adding hot water to my noodles unfulfilling and oddly depressing and missed having a proper meal. Due to the lack of iety in the tinned meals, I also got quite bored with what I was eating and actually missed veg. It wasnapost healthy As the fruit I had soon went off, and because I wasnapost in the position to keep going back to Poundland on a daily basis to buy fresh produce throughout the week, my diet was mainly based on tinned food and canned fish or eggs with bread, which wasnapost conducive to healthy living.  I also bought chocolate and crisps that I wouldnapost normally purchase, just because they were so cheapso I was eating extra unwanted calories, and despite eating dried fruit and nuts and some fruit to try and get some vitamins in me, I still felt hungry, sluggish and unfulfilled. There wasnapost any alcohol Completely contradicting myself when talking about trying to be healthy, I noticed that I couldnapost buy any alcohol on the cheap in Poundland, which was a bit disappointing. But then again I supposeit was on offer there it may encourage excess alcoholism, which is something that should be discouraged. Final thoughts  The experience of purely eating Poundland food for a week was a bit lacking for me, due to the lack of fruit, veg and meat that Iaposm normally used to eating. The canned produce that I had was rather uninspiring, unhealthy, and wasnapost always as much of a bargain as I initially anticipated. And even though there was some fresh food available, it soon went off. So before Poundland truly tries to compare itself to supermarkets and encourage more food shoppers through its doors, it needs to offer a better iety of fruit and add vegetables and more meat to its repertoire, as well as offering more goods for under £ in order to better compete. But after this experiment,Iaposm in need of branded items such as ketchup at a cheap price, or cleaning items and even toiletries, Iaposll certainly consider popping into Poundland for a couple of bits, but not for the food shop. I never thought Iaposd say it, but now the challenge is over, I canapost wait to gobble back some broccoli, aubergine and spinach accompanied by fresh fish or cooked meat, and I certainly donapost want to look at a packet of super noodles or tin of soup for a long while.  "},{"url":null,"title":"woman days live saved thanks","story":"NewsWoman with days to live is saved thanks to box that mimics the human bodyEXCLUSIVE: Helen Rawlinson, who was desperate for a second liver transplant, was brought back from the brink of death by a pioneering deviceShareCommentsByJack Longstaff:,  APR NewsHelen Rawlinson had consigned herself to her fate after being told she was way down the priority list for a new liver \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHelen Rawlinson lay in her hospital bed, hours from death, writing goodbye letters to her family. At her side, fiancé Darryl Flynn was holding her hand, not wanting to give up hope. At just  and waiting for a second liver transplant, brave Helen seemed to have run out of chances to live. Because of her medical history and fears her body would reject a new liver, she was way down the priority list for the healthiest transplant organs available – normally from donors who have been on le support. And she was so poorly, she was given little chance of even a “lower quality” donation after circulatory deathliver – likely to be damaged by lack of blood circulation after death through heart or lungs failure. But, almost miraculously, Helen was about to be given the best gt of her le. A liver wrapped up in a BOX. As she lay dying, her consultant liver specialist at St James’s University Hospital in Leeds decided on one last throw of the dice. Magdy Attia had been involved in clinical trials with American company TransMedics which had built a pioneering Organ Care System machine that mimicked conditions in the human body, keeping a donor liver healthy and “alive” with blood circulating through it. Mr Attia told the firm of Helen’s plight and astonishingly they agreed to send the box – still undergoing trials in Massachusetts – on a , mile journey to Britaina donor could be found. Crucially it also meant any DCD liver inside could be thoroughly tested by doctors before the operation to ensure it was viable.    While all this was being quietly arranged, teacher Helen, of Lancaster, was preparing for death after years of battling autoimmune hepatitis – a condition where the immune system attacks the liver. After falling ill in  she had been placed on the emergency transplant list and a match was found within a week. “It took me a year to recover properly from the operation,” she says: “My body felt like it was broken.” Helen lived normally until  when her liver came under attack again. She was also diagnosed with a heart defect which needed an op to insert a stent. She became so weak, she was placed on the organ transplant list again in March . But her risk of a second failure put her th in the queue for a high-quality donation after brainstem deathliver. “I was so, so poorly. I spent the next four months dying in hospital,” says Helen. “I turned extremely yellow and was really skinny. I looked awful. “I was on the list but until it was my turn there was nothing they could do for me. I was just waiting and waiting and I felt myself just wasting away. My family tried and tried to get me up the list but there was no movement.” The hospital even offered Helen and Darryl, , the chance to marry in its chapel, but the couple refused as Helen felt it would mean she was giving up on her chance of le. She says: “I always held on to the hope that I would get better.” But by August Helen had deteriorated so much she was put on palliative care – and had asked to go home to die. She says: “I had given up all hope. I had fought for so long and had tried to stay positive. I asked Darryl to take me home to die. He was distraught. It was absolutely horrendous for us. “I was on my deathbed. I wrote letters to my family for when I was gone.”    But just one day after she had asked to be taken home, a matching donor with a “lower quality” liver was found in the north of England. In a race against time, the Transmedics box was put on a flight to the UK and the bedside of her donor. And its incredible preservation techniques meant it ticked all the boxes for Helen. The magic box was then rushed to Leeds and Helen was prepared for an operation that would save her le – and make her the first person in the UK who has undergone a second transplant with the help of the machine. Helen says: “We were all absolutely over the moon. They said I only had until the end of the week. I didn’t think I’d get a new liver – I had to come to terms with dying. “The machine saved my le and can save so many others. All I was told is that the donor was in the north of England. “The liver was put into the machine and sent to me in Leeds. It preserved the organ, kept it healthy for me and made it possible. Without it, I wouldn’t be here now. “What the company did, to send me the machine, was absolutely amazing. They completely saved me and have changed my le.”  Within days Helen’s jaundice disappeared – and  days after the op she was allowed home. Mr Attia told us the machine is the “Rolls-Royce” of organ transplantation. He said: “DCD livers are lower in quality and present a higher risk for transplants. The machine tests the organ . “It’s also one way of avoiding damaging the liver. “It’s kept warm and supplied with oxygen. With Helen, a DBD liver was not available to us. She was very sick and was disadvantaged by the allocation system. “The only way to treat her was with a DCD liver using the machine. She needed a transplant urgently and we approached TransMedics on compassionate grounds. They agreed to send it to us for free with no hesitation. “They responded within  hours and the machine was available to us within a week.” Similar machines that are part of a European trial are being used in a handful of hospitals in the UK, but there were none available for Helen at Leeds. The OCS perfusion machine isn’t readily available for patients as it is still undergoing US trials, which are due to be completed in December . Helen is now looking to the future, and will marry welding inspector Darryl in May  at their local church. She says her wedding will be “full of music, love and laughter”. Over the last eight months Helen has amazed doctors with her seamless recovery, and says she feels healthier now than she has in years. “I couldn’t thank the company or my doctors enough. I can’t put it into words how lucky I feel,” she says. “I’ve got a le now. There’s no greater gt.” Lting the lid on a miracle  The Transmedics Organ Care Systemis described by its inventors as “portable, multi-organ preservation technology”. The box mimics conditions inside the human body, minimizing the chance of injury to organs through poor blood supply, and ensuring they are kept in top condition. There are three types of OCS machines – lung, liver and heart. Warm, oxygenated blood is pumped through organs asthey are in a living, al state. As a result, the lung breathes, the heart beats, and the liver produces bile. The machine analyses organand provides conditions better than cold storage – the normal way of preserving organs. The OCS liver machine was submitted for its first clinical trials in August . They have so far involved  people and have focused on side effects and post- transplant outcomes. The results will be known in . Similar machines are being trialled by another company in europe –successful it is hoped they’ll become available worldwide.

Amy Williams from Acton, in Wrexham, was just  when she noticed a lump in her breast in August last year. The primary school teacher had it checked during a routine appointment for her asthma just days later.Without any serious concerns, her doctor thought the lump was a fibroadenoma - a solid, noncancerous breast lump that can occur in women between  and  years of age, North Wales Live reports.   Amy was first told the lump was nothing to worry about because of her young age - unless it began to change. But, after just six weeks, the lump had grown and it began to  feel uncomfortable, albeit not painful. Amy, now , ignored it until she became sick with tonsillitis at the end of November . She said: I didnapost ring up for an appointment to check because naively, I didnapost think it could be big, scary cancer. I made an appointment in November to get some antibiotics after coming down with tonsillitis so while I was there, I just asked the nurse to check the lump. It had become bigger and it wasnapost necessarily painful, but I could feel it and it was uncomfortable.    I didnapost think it would be cancer. Every time Iaposd seen a doctor, the word cancer was never mentioned because of my age and because there was no history of breast cancer in my family. But they seemed a bit worried due to its size and the fact I could feel it when I wasnapost touching it so she referred me to another doctor a week later who referred me to the hospital just to double check. And thataposs when it all started. Amy was given the devastating diagnosis a few days after Christmas Day that she had breast cancer. Weeks later, she had the tumour removed and Amy is now undergoing chemotherapy treatment, which will hopefully clear her body of the disease. The consultant treating the -year-old described her as a bolt out the blue and really, really unlucky. Amy added: This disease can get anyone at anytime unfortunately with no reasons or explanations.    It doesnapost really sink in straight away and I went through all the emotions. First I was shocked, then I was numb and then I became angry, angry at the fact that I had it. You never think something like this could happen to you and I never thought in a million years that Iaposd be that person who says Iaposve got breast cancer. I thought Iaposd have more chance of having a heart attack or at least diabetes at  with my diet over having breast cancer. However Iaposm going to be that person who says Iaposve beaten it. Now Amy is urging everybody, of every age, to be more aware of their bodies and to ask for medical adviceany lump, of any size, is found. Since she shared her story, Amy says she knows of others who have since found abnormal lumps and moles, which they have had checked out, while others have booked in for smear tests which they have put off for years.    It makes sharing my story all worth it when you know others have checked for lumps and have taken action. This has been a scarier process than any quick smear test or check for lumps will ever be. Girls,you find a lump, you have to get it checked out straight away. It sounds silly now, but because I was working and I was really busy, it wasnapost top of my priorities to go to the doctor, and I am really laid back about everything. I never thought it would be the worse case scenario.   She added: I canapost put into enough words how grateful and lucky I am to have the people around me that I do.

contractor and still we know nothing.“The administration must come clean and tell the people of Aberdeen when work will begin on UTG and what the timescale for the project actually is.“The original timeline for this project had it finishing summer , and while we know that is not going to happen, it’s not good enough to hide behind a veil of secrecy and not tell the public when work will actually begin and end.”Mr Lumsden said: “This is exactly the kind of development citizens of Aberdeen are crying out for.“It really is high time the SNP stopped knocking our city and started to take pride and interest in the benefits of the Aberdeen City Centre Masterplan agreed unanimously by council in .”An Aberdeen City Council spokesman said the process of appointing a contractor was “nearing completion”.He added that: “It would be inappropriate for us to comment while we are completing commercial negotiations.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit navel gazing and naval support","story":"Colin

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”. Church members meet together and operate between Ayr, St Quivox two churches Auchincruive and Dalmilling Church on Dalmilling Road, Ayr on alternating Sundays. Holy Week Services will be held at Auchincruive each evening at pm until Good Fridayand Easter Sunday funwill begin at .am , with breakfast served in the Crypt at .am and Service start at .am.

But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement. The lease was not terminated earlier due to an administrative error.”   The council shut the Coylton hub  in Spring  along with two other libraries in Dailly and Dundonald to save a projected £, that year.   Coylton villagers waved placards as workers turned up to strip the shelves of books during a tense protest soon.  At the time council head of leisure Jill Cronin said the closure of the Coylton hub was “necessary” to “help the council balance its budget.” She added: We know local people are disappointed about the decision to close the library and we do sympathise.”  The Local Democracy Reporting Service was unable to reach the owner of the library building for comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14420843.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_elliots2.jpg","title":"first look inside new elliots","story":"NewsFirst look inside the new Elliots as Prestwick firm Buzzworks unveil Vics and the VineBuzzworks have given a glimpse into their brand new venue, which is set to open in early May.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsThe stylish exterior\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCustomers have been given a sneak peek into the revamped Elliots, which will open its doors next month.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed. Scottish Government bosses said work on the A, which will cost £. million, is now ready to proceed. It follows the official award of a construction contract to Willis Bros Civil Engineering. The project will create a .-mileroad designed to ease the burden of traffic thundering through the tight confines of Maybole. Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson, said: The local community will benefit from opportunities created for small and medium enterprises to bid for subcontractor roles and the provision of at least four vocational and seven professional, site-based training opportunities. The contractor anticipates that the project could employ up to  people during the months of peak construction activity, a number of which are created by the project.

The new bypass will benefit drivers on the A and opens the way for new investment and redevelopment in Maybole.It is disappointing that the Scottish Government chose not to fully dual the bypass, missing an opportunity to futureproof the road, but it’s still a major step forward for the area.This is an important investment but there’s much more that could be done to improve the A along its entire . Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish water insists ayrshire drinking","story":"NewsScottish Water insists Ayrshire drinking supply is safe following concerns over taste and odourBosses at Scottish Water say the supply throughout Ayrshire is still safe to drink.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsScottish Water has ruled out health concerns \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshireaposs drinking water IS safe to consume, officials at Scottish Water insisted today.

The trainee paramedic was a size  and had a body mass indexof . when she was diagnosed with the disease at . At just ft tall and weighing st lbs, she was horried with the way she looked. Katy, from Troon, recalled: “When I look back, it feels like the big me with type  diabetes is a dferent person. “I was so self-conscious, and embarrassed to have type  diabetes so young and to have to inject in front of people.” Katy first attended a slimming group at , but struggled to lose any weight with it. And when doctors discovered her diabetes as she prepared for surgery to correct an underdeveloped jaw, she lost her confidence even more. She explained: “I was all geared up for the surgery. I’d been so self-conscious about both my weight and my jaw. I just wanted to get it sorted. “But, as the doctors were prepping me, they realised my blood sugar levels were sky high. The surgery was postponed as they ran tests, which showed I had type  diabetes. “Looking back, I’d had signs, like constant thirst, tiredness, and needing to go to urinate all the time, but I’d been too scared to go and have it all confirmed. “The diagnosis itself was devastating. I remember being shown how to inject myself, trying to do it and just sobbing, saying I couldn’t. “I then had to deal with going back to school and adjusting to this new le. I didn’t want anyone to see me injecting, and felt so embarrassed. “At that age, you just want to be like everyone . It was hell.” She went on: “I would eat rubbish – big plates of chips for lunch, then take-aways in the evening. “I did very little exercise too. I’d not long passed my driving test, so drove absolutely everywhere – including to the McDonald’s drive-thru most evenings.” Things changed for Katy when, in April , a Facebook post about WW – the new Weight Watchers – caught her eye. After initially trying out the plan, she was shocked to discover she had reduced her blood sugar levels to match those of someone without type  diabetes. She continued: “I saw these amazing before and after pictures and thought, ‘That’s what I want.’ “I knewI didn’t do it then I never would, so I contacted my WW leader Morag and went down to a meeting. “They explained how to use their SmartPoints system, which tracks food and drink to nudge users towards a more nutritious diet. “It made complete sense to me and I especially loved the app, enabling you to scan food in the supermarket and find out how many points it’s worth. “I’d tried other regimes in the past and hadn’t stuck to them, as they were so impractical. You can’t exactly go out to a restaurant and eat weight loss shakes or supplements. “But I liked WW as it didn’t bring attention to the fact I was trying to slim down. I could still eat the foods I liked, but it taught me about moderation and to stop pushing myself to eat when I was full.” Katy eventually hit her current weight of st lb and has never been happier. She no longer needs to inject insulin, she just takes two Metformin tablets a day – a drug often used to treat type  diabetes. The charity Diabetes UK says that though there is no guarantee that the condition has gone forever – it is possible to go into remission – and losing around kgincreases the chances of doing so. Katy now lives on fresh, home-cooked meals, prepared from scratch and hits the gym three times a week, where she does cardio and lts weights. She said: “My advice to anyone  out there feeling how I once did is just to take those first steps, go to that first meeting. “It doesn’t take long for change to happen. You can still go out, have fun and socialise too. “You don’t need to stop your le in order to feel dferent.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyrBMIFacebookSupermarketsEducationSocial mediaTroon"},{"url":null,"title":"30-year-old-admonished-for-causing-ae-disturbance","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who caused a disturbance at Borders General Hospital on Christmas Day in  has been admonished at Selkirk Sherf Court.Cassie McDermott, of Gala Park, previously had sentence deferred for six months for good behaviour.The -year-old had admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner in the hospitals casualty ward."},{"url":null,"title":"horse-cruelty-trial-delayed-until-july","story":"THE trial of a Selkirk man accused of causing unnecessary suffering to horses in his care has been put off until the summer.Nick Mill, of Ettrickhaugh Road, previously denied the two charges at the towns sherf court and a trial was fixed for April .But at an intermediate hearing it was stated that pressure of business on that day with other trials meant it was unlikely to go ahead.As a result a new trial date has been set for July .The -year-old has been charged under the Animal Health and Welfare Scotland Act.It is alleged he failed to get proper veterinary care for a horse that was emaciated and another which had an infected tail.The offences are said to have happened at the Lauriston Stables in Ettrickhaugh Road between April  and July  last year."},{"url":null,"title":"leaderfoot-roadworks-finish-ahead-of-schedule","story":"ROADWORKS on the Leaderfoot Bridge between Melrose and Earlston have been removed two weeks ahead of schedule.The traffic management was due to last for three weeks but was removed after just  days on Thursday, April .The work was being conducted as part of the final stages of construction of a pound million pipeline designed to provide the local area with a more resilient water network.The new km pipe will carry nearly a million litres of clear, fresh drinking water each day.Scott Fraser, Scottish Waterrsquos Corporate Affairs Regional Manager, said: ldquoThe team has worked incredibly hard to get the traffic management element of these works completed as quickly as possible.ldquoThis pipeline will ensure that customers can continue to enjoy a reliable supply of fresh water long into the future."},{"url":null,"title":"have-a-cracking-easter-at-traquair","story":"A CRACKING good Easter is on the cards at Traquair House next weekend with the annual Easter Eggstravaganza.More than , mini eggs have been hidden in the famous maze.And there will be plenty opportunities to win bigger Easter eggs as well.Catherine Maxwell Stuart, organiser of the event, told us: \"The Easter Eggstravaganza is almost an institution at Traquair.\"We have been running the event since  when very few other Easter egg events were held at visitors attractions.\"We have refined the event over the year to ensure every child has a great time and everyone leaves with some eggs.But its not just about chocolate at Traquair during Easter as theres plenty more fun throughout the family day.There is a chance to make musical instruments and your very own Easter bonnet to take part in the Easter parade.And new this year is a fairy training workshop where children can brush up on making potions, wishes and spells with the Fairy Godmother.The Easter Eggstravaganza at Traquair takes place on Sunday, April .The grounds open at am with activities starting at noon.There are three egg hunts for under s this year -

She started by telling us that her vaccination was in the thigh, as it was for other girls, so that it didnrsquot mar the upper arm, just in case that girl, might later in le, wear a sleeveless evening dress - how thoughtful of the doctor! We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

There is a big waiting list in the county and we hope to open a base here.But planning officers urged councillors to reject LARrsquos proposals, regardless of their own efforts to build housing there two years ago.Iain McFarlane, head of planning, said that two years ago the council did not have its Local Development Plan approved and faced a shortage of land for affordable housing.Now the plan had been adopted, he said there was sufficient land supply for the next five years.He said allowing housing on the site would set an ldquoundesirable precedent, adding it would be ldquoselling our employment plans down the river.Councillor Kenny McLeod, committee member, said he was ldquodeeply uncomfortable about refusing planning permission on a site the council had tried to develop in the same way two years ago.At the time, council officers said the landowner rejected their pound, offer as too low.Robin Holder, representing LAR at the meeting, said the council had given written reassurance it would consider the site, which has lain empty since , for housing.He rejected claims that approving the plans would set a precedent, saying: ldquoThis is a small area, this site is a quarter of one per cent of land identied for industrial use in East Lothian. The site has been vacant for many years and the evidence suggests it will remain so.But Councillor Norman Hampshire said: ldquoI cannot support the application: it would send a message to other owners of land designated for business use.The committee rejected the planning application by six votes to three.Following the meeting, Ms Leslie said: ldquoNaturally we are disappointed at the decision and are considering whether to appeal against it.ldquoWe have worked very closely with East Lothian Council over the last three years on a number of projects to enhance the provision of good-quality affordable homes in the area and have enjoyed a very positive working relationship with them.ldquoOur proposal for Prestonpans was a design and build project for  homes, very similar to our recently completed development at the disused site of the former boatyard in Cockenzie.

seeing the right clinician at the right time for their specic needs.The new service, developed in partnership by Riverside, NHS  and ELHSCP, ensured that urgent care was dealt with on the same day and patients should have ldquono anxieties about being seen by the right professional at the right time.Through this new way of delivering patient care, it not only provided an increase in the number of patient appointments with practice GPs and other healthcare professionals, but also provided an increase in appointmentfor patients with complex needs.A recent survey conducted within the practice demonstrated that more than half of patients agreed that they did not always need to see a GP.Work is also under way by ELHSCP to implement a new telephone and IT system that will support call demand into the practice.The importance of patient involvement in getting services right is ldquovery much recognised by the practice, which is encouraging residents to get involved with the Patient

other organisations to ensure that improvements are made and I would encourage anyone with any issues regarding the practice to get in touch with them and become involved with the patient

This makes le easy and no one really knows you are on a healthy eating plan as I can eat just like everyone .ldquoEverything about the Freestyle plan just suits me, and, even though I donrsquot eat meat or fish, I can still eat a lot of what I like.ldquoThe weekly workshops are very motivational and I love going. My wellness coach, Lisa Stewart, is so supportive, as well as all the other members.ldquoNow I can make the right choices, walk more and shop for clothes that I would never have been able to buy before. Clothes shopping has also become really enjoyable and less expensive as I no longer need to buy a size  but a rather smaller size .ldquoWalking has now become easier as I used to get breathless but this does not happen now. I have the motivation to keep going even when Irsquove put weight on as Irsquom not perfect.Derek was inspired to lose weight by Carole, saying: ldquoMy we joined Weight Watchers and her initial weight loss was inspiring. I knew I had to lose weight but I just never had the motivation to do anything about it.ldquoMy we was looking amazing and it was then that I knew it was time for me to get on the Weight Watchers wagon. Irsquom so glad I joined with Carole as I find it easy to follow.ldquoI can still eat my favourite snacks ndash crisps ndash which is something I was not prepared to give up. Thankfully I can enjoy these and still lose weight.ldquoDoing the Freestyle plan with Carole is really good although we do not always eat the same foods. The choice of foods that we can enjoy and eat means both us can enjoy what we want.ldquoThe support from the coach Lisa is fantastic and sometimes Irsquom the only male who stays for the weekly talk. This does not phase me as my weight loss is too important and everyone is really friendly. Even when my we canrsquot make it, I go on my own. Men should not be afraid of joining as Irsquove had a fantastic weight loss.ldquoMy food choices are now better and I pay more attention to what I eat. We both used to eat things like large bars of chocolate, deep-pan pizzas, lots of bread and cheese. There was no thought to what we were eating.ldquoWe now eat better with lots of fresh fruit and veg, and have more thought in what we are preparing and eating and are both enjoying our food much better.He added: ldquoA big tick to myself is that I can now buy jeans in Primark ndash something I was not able to do before. It sounds silly but being able to go and buy a  waist instead of a -inch waist just makes me smile. My top size used to be an XXXL but can now buy a size XL L, so itrsquos quite clear why I enjoy buying new clothes."},{"url":null,"title":"church-bids-for-extension-to-serve-the-community","story":"Pastor Andrew Agnew said ground behind the existing church would offer a sizeable new hall to seat  people and accommodate a small stage.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

Itrsquos an empty place of rolling hills and crags, wide-open skies, silver water, green turf and lonely beauty. For Hunter, though, the emptiness of the strath, north of the Dornoch Firth in Sutherlandrsquos east, is plain wrong. He points to the fields below us.ldquoYou could live herethere was a house you could afford, next to the loch with a beautul view, he says. ldquoThe Arsquos four miles away, so is the railway ndash this isnrsquot the back of beyond. If effort was put in, it could happen.He points again, to Carrol, a couple of cottages across Loch Brora. In , months after the once-thriving township was cleared and its homes destroyed, the Countess of Sutherland came here, then wrote to her husband, the Marquess of Stafford, of her ldquomelancholy at the sight. The couple would later become the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, and were the most notorious proponents of the Clearances.ldquoI find it extraordinary, says Hunter. ldquoThe countess writes about it almost asitrsquos an act of God that the place was devastated and in ruins but it was that way because she and her husband had ordered to it to be.Hunterrsquos a historian and a Highlander, and has a deep knowledge of the dark blot on Scotlandrsquos story when much of the population was removed from the land to make way for sheep but for him itrsquos much more than history: the Clearances are something which can at least in part be undone. Land such as this has only been deserted for  years after millennia of occupation, and to him that means it can and should be inhabited again, a process which has become known as ldquore-peopling.He is an influential figure: author of  books on the Highlands and islands, he was the first director of the University of the Highlands and Island Centre for History, and from - was chairman of government development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.Now the idea of re-peopling is gaining traction, with substantial Scottish Government backing, and potential changes to planning rules.But can people be brought back to stabilise fragile communities, re-inhabit deserted glens and islands, and bring them to le again As the crow flies itrsquos  miles from Brora to the island of Ulva, off the coast of Mull. What they have in common is near-emptiness, and whatrsquos happening in Ulva is seen as a test case in re-peopling.Rhuri Munro shows me the rented home he shares with his we, Rebecca, and their children Matilda and Ross.ldquoThe walls are starting to crumble, and therersquos constant damp, he says. The leaky roof brought the ceiling down in the childrenrsquos bedroom, and they were moved to the spare room, done up at the familyrsquos expense.They donrsquot need the Raeburnrsquos heat in summer butthey donrsquot run it condensation builds up. Rhuri stabs a finger at a flaking wooden window frame: ldquoTherersquos no insulation. All the windows need replacing. You have to keep pumping your own money in and it got to the stage where we werenrsquot going to do that again.The only other inhabitant of Ulva, pensioner Barry George, lives in a cottage with its own maintenance problems. The Munros say other inhabitants left the island in recent years because of poor rented housing.If the remainder had left it would have completed a process started in . That was when Francis William Clark bought the island. In  years he reduced the population of  to . Roofs were burned to stop families ing Clark carried out evictions in person, acquiring a reputation for callousness.His family sold Ulva in  to the Howards, and it was the Howardsrsquo alleged failure to maintain homes, and lack of security of tenure, that made the Munros back a community buyout when Jamie Howard put it on the market in . For the Munros it was simple: they feared being cleared out by a new owner, like their predecessors. Rebecca says: ldquoWe saw the buyout as our only real option of control.The Duchess, the Highland Clearances, the housekeeper ... and a story to make you weepWhen, after a year of worry for the islanders, the Scottish Governmentrsquos Scottish Land Fundmade a pound.m grant, the buyout could go ahead. On June , , a couple of hundred people gathered on Ulva to celebrate its completion.The grant put the island at the forefront of the re-peopling movement. The SLF, set up to help community buyouts, paid it to the North West Mull Community Woodland Company , the organisation that actually made the purchase.To get the grant it put forward a plan for a major increase in population. As well as proposing to reinhabit existing island houses, the plan says new crofts can be established, and self-builders can have plots, with a long-term target of  people living on the island.One of the people who drew up the plan was community land consultant Calum Macleod, now policy officer for umbrella group Community Land Scotland, and a leading proponent of re-peopling.For him, spending public money to let people live lives many urban dwellers would envy is a matter of maintaining important ersity, vital to stop the inexorable draw of towns and cities.He believes Ulva is a test case: ldquoIt offers an opportunity to show where the potential can be realised for re-peopling and repopulating, he says. ldquoItrsquos not somewhere that is a wild area, there are existing houses, but itrsquos a good example of what can be done.Yorkshireman Ian Hepburn is one of the people charged with re-peopling Ulva. Hersquos a director of NWMCWC, which has forestry land and woodland crofts on Mull, and also chairs CLS. He lives at Dervaig on Mull, eight miles from Ulva.Hepburn meets me at the Ulva jetty a few months after the buyout and we roar off on a quad-bike tour of empty properties the company now owns.Plans to regenerate lost townships decimated by the Highland ClearancesAs well as cottages, there is the big house, with five main bedrooms plus ldquoservantsrsquo quarters. It echoes and the decorrsquos tatty but the property is sound: one idea is to lease it as a small family-run hotel. The old Manse, last lived in eight years ago, is decaying but Ardalum House, used briefly as a tourist hostel, could almost open for business tomorrow.Hepburn says more than  people have expresed interest in living on Ulva. ldquoThe reality and the ambition are not always in line but we will get people for sure wanting to live here when we get houses redeveloped.ldquoThe key thing is they wonrsquot be holiday homes, we want families in them, living and working. With modern telecommunications the location doesnrsquot make much dference to what you do for a living, so wersquore confident we can end up with a ing, living island relatively quickly.Many of the ideas for creating work here are tourism based, but crofts based on the productive land could each provide part of a living.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be modern-day lairds, Hepburn adds. ldquoWe want to create the potential for other people to run a business here to bring the le back.Back in Strath Brora, Jim Hunter points out that re-peopling has happened before, with the creation of crofts by the Government for former soldiers after the First World War, in Skye, the outer isles and where.Hunter says Strath Brorarsquos farmland, neglected for two centuries could be revived, and like Hepburn, believes other work will follow, with internet links a major factor.Pointing to a growing population on Skye, Hunter says when homes are available, people will come and then find or create work.Up the strath at the remains of the former schoolhouse ndash two long, tumbled walls overgrown with bracken ndash Hunter looks south to a wind farm. That kind of development too can provide funds to underpin a community, ldquo it is owned by the community, the money stays here and doesnrsquot go to an outside company.Could more community buyouts, of the Ulva type, foster more re-peopling  The islands of Eigg and Gigha have seen populations grow by % in recent years, as has Knoydart: all three are community owned. On Eigg people who want to live there do find work: some incomers farm but others are journalists, run tourist accommodation, bike hire and craft businesses, recording studios, a brewery...Hunter is a community land enthusiast but he acknowledges a problem with Ulva, Eigg, Gigha and Knoydart as templates for his ideas. ldquoCommunity buyouts can only happen where there is a community, and in places that were comprehensively cleared there are no communities.So, he says, while ownership is an issue, and a change can bring more people in, more fundamental is planning regulations.ldquoOur planning regime tends to the view that a locality such as this in Strath Brora where there is nobody living, should remain one where no-one is living, and houses and businesses are only to be encouraged where there are houses and businesses already.ldquoI can understand that but I think itrsquos not impossible to envisage these things happening in localities where people lived not all that long ago in historical termsldquoIf you look around us here there is no lack of land, there are millions of acres in the Highlands doing not an awful lot, producing not very much. When you think a very small plot where the planners have said you can build a house in many parts of the Highlands now would sell for pound,, there is something completely bizarre about it when there is so much empty land.ldquoIn any real sense that landrsquos real worth should be pound to pound ... We need to revise the planning system and make it easier for people to get house sites.He says to make it easier for people, especially young people, to live in the Highlands the Scottish Government must put together legal and planning frameworks to ensure housing can be built and the system gives priority to social and community need, not private gain.ldquoThe mechanics are not rocket science. Whatrsquos required, but what sometimes seems to be in as short supply as affordable homes, is the political will.That political will is developing: amendments agreed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos proposed Planning Bill by Holyroodrsquos Local Government and Communities Committee include giving Scottish Ministers a duty to take into account the importance of resettling rural Scotland, and of making land available for resettlement. Others, including one to let local councils include re-population as an aim in their planning blueprints, are still on the table.Historian Sir Tom Devine on what really happened during the clearancesWhen I test Hunterrsquos ideas on Brora local history enthusiast Nick Lindsay, another student of the Clearances, he is sceptical about re-population, for Strath Brora at least. He says there are few jobs in the area, adding: ldquoThere would be a huge cost of infrastructure: I donrsquot see where the money would come from. Itrsquos a romantic notion but I think the practicalities are too hard to overcome.Hersquos not the only sceptic: Ulvarsquos Jamie Howard, now a flat-dweller in Edinburgh, says of re-peopling: ldquoIt has become a bit of an obsession with the government and an exercise in flag-waving, with this willingness to wind the clock back to the Clearances. On Ulva, the SNPrsquos ideal would be an island full of people with the right accent, singing from the same hymn sheet.But Sarah Jane Laing, chief executive of landownersrsquo group Scottish Land and Estates, takes a conciliatory tone, saying her members are the biggest housing providers in the countryside and would be happy to see more homes: ldquoWersquove got members all over the Highlands and Islands desperately trying to get planning permission for housing, she says.ldquoThose of us working in land management and land reform are not that far apart ndash what we and Community Land Scotland wants is to have sustainable rural communities.Hunter says resettlement of now-wild areas can go hand-in-hand with better environmental stewardship, pointing to estate records showing wildle was more ied and prolic when Strath Brora was heavily inhabited.Perhaps surprisingly the John Muir Trust wild land charity broadly agrees, even though re-peopling could mean homes on ldquowild land.The Trustrsquos chief executive, Andrew Bachell, says truly remote areas are unlikely to be re-inhabited: ldquoMost of what you would want to do to improve the ecology would involve having people there to manage it, he says. ldquoIf wersquore talking about more people in the north-west Highlands I donrsquot think therersquos any conflict with that and the rewilding agenda, in fact wild land will be one of the reasons people want to live there.While sceptics will always question the level of Government spending on near-empty Ulva when there are other pressing needs, the people at the sharp end donrsquot doubt the dference the re-peopling project will make.Rebecca Munrorsquos battered home on Ulva will be renovated as part of the drive to improve housing stock, and she can invest more in the Boathouse Restaurant next door that she runs with sister-in-law Emma McKie.I catch the strength of emotion in Rebeccarsquos voice when she talks of a future with other children to play with hers in the evening after the ferry has stopped running. Therersquos emotion there too when she speaks of the buyoutrsquos place in history.One of her favourite places on the island is known as Starvation Point, where th-century residents cleared from their old homes and too old or too sick to leave were left to fend for themselves.ldquoItrsquos sad but itrsquos also a really inspirational place, Rebecca says. ldquoA couple of times when things got really dficult with the buyout process I went down there and I thought, lsquothese people didnrsquot have any of these opportunities wersquove had, so just suck it up and get on with it, because you can do something and they couldnrsquot.rsquoldquoItrsquos very dficult not to get upset or angry about at what was done. The villages and townships are still very visible. When the Clearances happened those people had no rights and they had no comeback about what was happening, so there was definitely a bit of righting the wrongs that were done then, in our buyout.Where did the money come from The grant of pound. million by the Scottish Government to buy Ulva was a statement of intent about re-population. But how did it come about, and did connections between Government, grant-givers and the buyout group play a part After Ulva went on the market in , the Government, unusually, put the sale on hold. Then, in October , it allowed North West Mull Community Woodland Companyto register an interest in the estate as a community buyout objective, to allow it a clear run at a deal. This is normally done before any suggestion of a sale.A bid for pound.m went to the Scottish Land Fund , which can give pound million a year of Government cash to community buyouts. Its normal upper limit for single grants is poundm, but the fund backed the bid and referred it to ministers. It was approved in May .The chair of the SLF committee, which decides grants, is John Watt. He emphasises the SLF is run independently of government.ldquoWe had to take quite a few things into consideration, the impact on the budget, the wider land reform policy, as well as the intrinsic merits of the case, he says. ldquoOur decision was that given all the factors and given our understanding of the policy context for Government objectives to ersy the land ownership pattern ... we should recommend that this should be approved.He says the fund was aware a huge grant for Ulva could hit worthy smaller projects, but the government indicated extra money would be availableUlva went ahead.In fact, the Scottish Government says, a poundm underspend on the SLFrsquos budget in - was allowed to be carried over into -, to cover most of the Ulva cash.Meanwhile those involved in the bid say they maintain a professional distance between dferent aspects of their work, and no undue influence was brought to bear on the Scottish Government or the SLF.Calum MacLeod was a member of the Scottish Land Fund committee from its start in  until March . In July  he was engaged as one of three consultants to write the feasibility study submitted to the fund by NWMCWC to support the Ulva bid.Since then he has become part-time policy officer for Community Land Scotland , the prominent umbrella group that makes much of its income from work for the Scottish Government. He previously carried out projects for CLS, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Parliament. He says there is no suggestion his connections helped propel the Ulva grant application.Duncan MacPherson, who has worked extensively with community buyouts and was another of the Ulva consultants, is a member of the SLF committee, and was when the Ulva application was submitted.He declared an interest and took no part in discussions about Ulva, saying: ldquoI went on the committee to make sure people with experience of the sector took part in decisions ... The committee met separately to discuss the Ulva bid and I wasnrsquot even in the building.Ian Hepburn, a director of NWMCWC, also chairs CLS.Hepburn says: ldquoIn terms of did I take an active part in [the SLF grant application] or speak to anyone at the Scottish Government about it, I absolutely did not."},{"url":null,"title":"15-best-family-days-out-this-easter-across-scotland","story":".

We have the location and the people and the enthusiasm, and it seemed like something we could put together.ldquoThe idea is to bring more le back into Dunoon, and make people want to visit it like they used to back in the good old days.ldquoWe want them to come over on the ferry and spend a few days in the town. One of the major attractions is that the site is within walking distance ndash itrsquos right on your doorstep.ldquoTherersquos no need to take a bus or a car anywhere, you can just ride the cable car to the top and itrsquos all going to be there.Where many such schemes wither on the vine, or become bogged down after facing opposition from others in the community, the cable-car project has been buoyed by a groundswell of support.Town hall meetings have swelled in popularity ndash the first attracting  people, the second . All are well aware of Dunoonrsquos problems, and keen to do something to bring more le to area.But it has been the approach to the community buyout through the National Forest Land Scheme, which allows groups to buy surplus land, that has really piqued investorsrsquo interest, such as the asset manager Gresham House. Wallace said: ldquoWhatrsquos dferent about this community buyout is that wersquove kind of done it back to front. Other communities have concentrated first on what they want to buy, then gone looking for funding to work out what they intend to do.ldquoWersquove gone down the other route and have been seeking backers while doing the feasibility study. Thatrsquos now complete and itrsquos good ndash they have said that therersquos a good chance for backers to see a good, long-termon their investment.ldquoThe type of backers we have are looking for a[on their investment] over time, not a quick buck. And therersquos few better things to invest in than land developments and infrastructure projectsyou are looking at the long-term.Keith Holdt,who prepared the feasibility study, added: ldquoThe beauty of Dunoon is that itrsquos right in the path of people coming over to Argyll and Bute. Therersquos lots and people coming through, but therersquos currently no reason for them to hang around. But this gives them a reason to stay and spend money in the area.The team are now in the middle of preparing a Community Asset Transferto get the ball rolling. Aside from the support from the community, there has already been backing from tourists chiefs and investors.Iain Jurgensen, chairman of the Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, is one fan of the scheme who has been impressed by the strength of feeling in Dunoon.He said: ldquoThe Dunoon project is innovative and inspirational and will have the potential to be one of the most-visited tourist attractions in Scotland that will help bring huge footfall into Dunoon and the surrounding area.ldquoThe fact this is a community project reflects the passion of the residents to encourage change by using the resources around them in a truly inspiring project.And backers are now waiting in the wings, ready to invest the millions needed to make the project a reality.Tony Dalwood, CEO of Gresham House said: ldquoSmall-scale infrastructure investments are vital to local communities but theyrsquore often challenging for larger investment funds to address.ldquoGresham Housersquos British Strategic Investment Fundfocuses on this financing gap by working alongside its partners to deliver much-needed regional investment.ldquoBSIF invests in sub-pound million real assets projects in the UKrsquos housing and infrastructure sectors.\"It is a long-term investment fund that aims to achieve a positive social impact alongside attractive financial s for its investors.ldquoDunoon is an exciting project,\" Dalwood continued. \"We have been working with other advisers, including funding an independent feasibility study, to help the community formulate a strategy that meets its social objectives and translates into a dferentiated investment opportunity for the fund.\"We believe the development of essential local infrastructure will enable the community to deliver a regeneration project that supports local jobs and economic growth.The Dunoon project still has a long way to go, but the first phase is almost complete and it could be that a trip \"doon the watterrsquo will soon no longer be a thing of the past.And a community stands ready to welcome visitors once again, with a holiday experience their forebears would scarcely recognise.Mike Russell, MSP for the area, said: ldquoBig ideas sometimes have dficulty getting accepted in Scotland but this is a big idea that has generated a lot of support in Dunoon.ldquoThe most recent public meeting in the town about the project was enthusiastic and gave strong backing to the committed and imaginative team who are developing it.\"I think it can transform the town and the area and, having meet some of the potential backers, I am keen to do everything I can to help make it happen.ldquoSoon, I hope, the old boast about going doon the watter will also mean going lsquodoon the zip wirersquo above one of the Clyde coastrsquos most iconic venues."},{"url":null,"title":"2019 true origins festival to bring the best of scottish gin to lochter","story":"A new festival celebrating Scottish craft gin and showcasing  dferent gins from across the country is to be held at Lochter Activity Centre this weekend.With UK gin sales doubling in the last five years, the popularity of gin shows no sign of slowing.Try an old favourite or find a new tipple of choice at the festivalIt was a combination of this and a love for the quintessential British drink that inspired Banchory brothers Guy and Mungo Finlayson to bring the very best of local gin to consumers as well as creating their own bespoke gin brand, which was launched at their London festival in November .The brothers run MFGF Events and organise the annual Banchory and Inverurie Beer Festivals, which have also featured gin in recent years.Spearheaded by a passion to celebrate the very best in Scottish gin, based on quality and authenticity, the pair launched True OriGINs – the Scottish Gin Festival in London last year.Following the huge success of the London event, which attracted more than , visitors over four days, the Finlayson brothers announced plans for a series of festivals across Scotland, bringing the very best in Scottish gin back to its home.The festivals, which have already visited Banchory and Edinburgh promise a unique experience to discover the many gins that Scotland has to offer.As well as a wide and expansive selection of locally curated gins, the True OriGINS festivals has also launched Guy and Mungo’s very first gin, Autumn.Offering up to  gins sourced from across Scotland, each bottle and glass served has a story and every story has its own explanation.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Anti-Viking Energy march outnumbered this lot four to one and that was not promoted by any political party. I do not suppose former councillor Jonathan Wills would care to comment nor for that matter Gary Robinson, the former Council Political Leader. #Nota Bene#, yesterdays men to the fore as they say every picture tells a story!!!.So after the country voted to leave these clowns think we should vote again with remain or remain on the ballot. No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/web-subs.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic psni dealing with security alerts in londonderry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch teams are All Ireland champions  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH was at the centre of Irelandrsquos sporting world at the weekend.It was a case of doubles all round for the townrsquos rugby club.The lsquoHinch won the All-Ireland League Division B title and their fourths lted the coveted Crawford Cup at the Kingspan Stadium.Just to make it a Super Saturday, Ballynahinch Hockey Club travelled down to Dublin and lted the Irish Challenge Hockey Cup for the second year in succession to complete a memorable season for Mark Brownrsquos boys.The rugby first XV dealt with St Maryrsquos College without undue trouble at Ballymacarn Park to secure their place in the top flight of Irish club rugby.Their - victory prompted huge celebrations after skipper Aaron Cairns got his hands on the trophy.ldquoThis is massive for the club, said Cairns. ldquoAll the hard work this season has finally paid off.ldquoWe wouldnrsquot have got here without our coaches, Brian McLaughlin and Tom Rock, and all the backroom staff.ldquoThere is a lot that goes on behind the scenes and without that we couldnrsquot do it.ldquoWersquove learnt lessons from our time before in A and hopefully wersquoll take that back up with us and see how we get on, added Cairns.Indeed, the trick will be staying in A somewhat longer this time around mdash lsquoHinch managed three campaigns of mostly struggle before exiting in  mdash and that fresh challenge awaits Brian McLaughlinrsquos squad.Over at Ravenhill, an experienced fourths team had just enough in the tank to defeat local rivals Banbridge thirds - to keep the Crawford Cup in the Ballymacarn Park trophy cabinet for another year.The lsquoHinch were good value for their victory in a tough, uncompromising battle, but the lsquoHinchrsquos greater experience stood them in good stead.All heads then turned towards Dublin where the hockey club faced Limerick at Serpentine Avenue in the Irish Challenge Cup final.Manager Mark Brown sent his troops out full of confidence and goals from man of the match William Edgar , Scott Leetch and Matthew Martin were good enough to give them a - victory in an entertaining final.Edgarrsquos two pieces of inidual brilliance were worthy of winning any competition in a superb display of expansive, attacking hockey.This was Ballynahinchrsquos third Irish title in seven years mdash and by far the hardest to win.The game went back and forth at breakneck speed with goals soon starting to flow.lsquoHinch, always look the more composed side with former Instonians man Matthew Martin and the predatory Edgar having that touch of class.Limerick made a real go of it in the last five minutes, but Ballynahinch had the nous to see out the game and lt the crown for a third time..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Calum wins heat at Mary Peters Track  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC juniors attended the first meet of the Firmus Fab  Series at the Mary Peters Track on Thursday night, taking part in nine events collectively.Calum Cope won his heat in the U- boysrsquo  metre race.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

But even when pressed, she was firm: “It’s really clear to me – I’d a meeting with the Northern Ireland Civil Service first thing this morning.”Within minutes of her comments being reported, the DUP’s Nigel Dodds tweeted to say “Oh dear...this is not correct” and by the time I got back to the newsroom, Mrs Bradley was on the phone to “clary” her inaccurate comments.In what is a complicated and often thankless role, a mistake by a new appointee is eminently forgivable. Unfortunately, during  months in post Mrs Bradley has become a walking gaffe, known mainly for her bumbling.In an interview with The House magazine last September, Mrs Bradley said that she had never been to Northern Ireland before her appointment and did not understand that nationalists do not vote for unionist parties. Undeterred by that elemental ignorance, Mrs May enthused that her friend was “doing an excellent job”.Six weeks ago, Mrs Bradley told MPs that the % of Troubles killings by the security forces “were not crimes” – despite the fact some of them have led to soldiers being jailed – but were the actions of people operating in a “dignied and appropriate way”. Lacking the political nous to immediately grasp the scale of that error, she ed to the Commons to clary – but not apologise.Facing a wave of predictable outrage, Mrs Bradley was forced into a grovelling apology in which she used the memorable line:“I do not believe what I said.”That same week, she misled Parliament by claiming that Northern Ireland’s five main parties endorse secrecy of past political donations.Mrs Bradley has presided over an unprecedented governance vacuum at Stormont, leaving confusion as to who can take key decisions about public services. But rather than sense the danger of leaving civil servants in control without democratic accountability, she has given mandarins a blank cheque. In astonishing comments, Mrs Bradley said it would be “absolutely wrong” for civil servants “to find their decisions being scrutinised by politicians”. Some of Stormont’s senior officials are less than thrilled that her refusal to take control has left them acting as quasi-politicians overseeing a multi-billion pound budget.It is overwhelmingly not her fault that the DUP and Sinn Féin cannot agree to govern. But in the absence of devolution she has shown no ability to seek creative alternatives.Every major Northern Irish political party has now lost confidence in Mrs Bradley, yet she seems unsackable, seemingly because of her unbending loyalty to Mrs May.  and Notra Dame \"   and Notra Dame \"  Compare the generous reaction to Notre Dame with miserly one to Grenfell: ex-MLA Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But keeping her in post is causing the long-standing Westminster convention of bipartisanship on Northern Ireland to fray, with her genteel Labour opposite number, Tony Lloyd, calling for her to consider her position.At a time when the Prime Minister needs a capable and perceptive minister to advise her on the complexities of Northern Ireland, Theresa May has – through her decision to prioritise loyalty over ability – someone who in  months has only stayed overnight in Belfast  times. That is not only to Northern Ireland’s detriment but helps explain why Mrs May has so consistently misread the DUP, undermining herself.try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinRat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant -

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Surely it should be three strikes and out for this deal now And so on Monday, further indicative votes were held as MPs once again took control of parliamentary business ndash despite attempts by the government to shut down our debate before it started.Supporting the move to hold these further indicative votes on Monday, I said: ldquoI think Parliament made remarkable progress the other day in a few hours, compared with the Government, who have had two years to sort this out.\"It is important that we not only have the opportunity to make further progress tonight, but,necessary, a small amount of time on Wednesday to get to where we need to be, so that Parliament can take control and we can move forward together as a House.And so on Monday evening, there was a hugely signicant result placing a Peoplersquos Vote as the top option for resolving the impasse, with a Customs Union only narrowly missing out as well.I voted the same way as I did last week ndash for a Customs Union for a Peoplersquos Vote, and to revoke Article we face a No Deal Brexit.Itrsquos time for the PM to compromise for the good of the country.We all need to work together to find a solution.We need a credible Brexit option to be put to a public vote in a final say, with the option on the ballot paper to Remain, in order to find a way through this crisis. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age.
