Khan studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics, graduating three years later. Promising a ‘new Pakistan’, Imran Khan’s election victory has resulted in claims of vote rigging by rivals and has drawn widespread media attention, something the former cricket captain and playboy is more than used to.As reported in the BBC, Imran Khan has transformed into a religious reformer but struggled to garner support after forming his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party in 1996, was the only candidate from his party to win a seat two years later.          Pakistani opposition leader of the Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) political party Imran Khan  speaksFor some, Imran became ‘Imran Khan’t’ and it took until 2013 for things to change and for his party to be taken seriously, when his party narrowly missed becoming the second largest in Pakistan. Today, he Khan will become the next Prime Minister of the nation.Prior to the election, the PTI held under 10 percent of the 342 seats in the National Assembly and will need to win a large number in the province of Punjab, which has over half of the 272 directly-elected seats. Imran Khan\u0027s cricket careerOn his return to Pakistan, Imran Khan secured a place on the national team and began touring, establishing himself as one of the fastest bowlers in the world. He peaked in 1982, the year when he got 62 wickets at 13.29 each - the lowest average of any bowler in Test history with a minimum of 50 wickets in a calendar year.          Imran Khan of Pakistan lifts the cricket World Cup after Pakistan beat England in the finalBefore playing his first Test match for Pakistan in 1992 against Sri Lanka, he achieved the all-rounder’s triple, which means that Imran secured 3000 runs and 300 wickets, in 75 tests and took a six-month break following his historic World Cup win against England in the same year.Imran retired from cricket after playing for two decades and soon became renowned as a playboy on the London nightclub circuit, although he claimed that he never drank alcohol or engaged in anything that would be deemed inappropriate for a conservative Pakistani Muslim, as the BBC reported.          Jemima Goldsmith, who married Imran Khan to become Jemima Khan pictured here in 1996Imran Khan wifeIn 1995 when Khan was 43, he married the 21-year-old daughter of Sir James Goldsmith, Jemima and although the marriage was dissolved in 2004, they had two sons. Their split was mutual and the pair still remain friends.Imran Khan remarried in 2015 to journalist Reham Khan, but this partnership only lasted a year. As The Guardian reported, after revealing that the former BBC weather presenter would be releasing a tell-all memoir on July 25, the day of the election, she had been harassed by her supporters.He wed again in 2018, this time to Bushra Watto, who has been described as his spiritual adviser and the reason why he has emerged as a pious character, as well as an established politician. However, many have accused Khan of making dramatic U-turns.      Imran Khan and the PTI partyOn Imran Khan’s profile, it states: His profile says: ‘The party has Islamic overtones and is inspired partly by Imran Khan’s renewed commitment to Islam.‘As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values, by creating an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law and, by promoting a merit-based system that provides equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.’Despite claims of ‘blatant rigging’ in what has been described as a pivotal general election for Pakistan, Khan was declared the winner, even though the official results have yet to be released by Pakistan\u0027s electoral commission. Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Muhammad Raza said: ‘These elections were 100 per cent fair and transparent,’ but did not confirm whether election authorities were in a position to release the official results.Rival party leader Shahbaz Sharif, brother of Nawaz Sharif, said on the day of the election: ‘What they have done has pushed Pakistan back 30 years...People will not bear it.’ After other parties also alleged fraud, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), it could cause problem when the PTI need to form a coalition.This comes after claims that there had been campaigns against the military in the ‘dirtiest’ election Pakistan has ever seen, because of the increase of extremist religious parties out in the open. Political analyst Azeema Cheema said it was ‘complete chaos’ and was ‘very concerned’.\u0027It depends on how the civilian disobedience is being organised. You may have spontaneous riots among political party workers. Then maybe political parties will organise sit-ins and demonstrations,\u0027 she said.Guru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Even in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 – when 100 per cent mortgages were offered to home buyers without a deposit – the country did not reach a point where the average household was a net borrower.\u0027In a sign that families are losing the habit of putting money aside for a rainy day, the proportion of disposable income that is saved has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. This is the third lowest since records began in 1963 and down from almost 15 per cent in the 1990s.The ONS said the typical household\u0027s outgoings were £900 higher than their incomings last year.The incomings relate to salaries, pensions, benefits and other income before tax and other costs. Corbyn ally Billy Bragg claims Jews have \u0027work to do\u0027 to...Boris Johnson \u0027held secret talks\u0027 with Trump\u0027s former...Share this articleThe outgoings include everything from tax, housing costs such as mortgages and rent and bills, to food, clothes, fuel and furniture.Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell investments, said: \u0027Economic growth founded on rising debt is clearly not sustainable and if this continues into the long term it would be profoundly worrying.\u0027One obvious reason for this is the interest rate environment we have experienced in recent years, encouraging people to borrow more and spend rather than save at the paltry rates offered through bank accounts and cash ISAs.\u0027Using a separate set of figures, the ONS report showed that the richest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income – after taxes and housing costs are accounted for – of more than £78,000 last year. These families spent less than £39,000 of that sum.By contrast, the poorest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income of just £5,000 but spent nearly £13,000.Jane Goodland, of wealth manager Quilter, said: \u0027This ONS research is yet another stark reminder of just how vulnerable the average UK household has become in terms of their financial wellbeing.

He predicts the social media giant\u0027s shares still have another 20 percent to fall.Wieser\u0027s street-low price target - his prediction of where stocks will move within the next year - is at $140, compared to the $174.78 low Facebook hit during early Thursday trading. The share price eventually closed in $176.26, but Wieser believes Facebook\u0027s days of 30 percent growth are now outnumbered.\u0027What a lot of the investment community has missed, is that they looked at growth as rather infinite,\u0027 Wieser told Bloomberg TV. \u0027This is only part of a bigger story that hasn\u0027t fully played out yet.\u0027Investors hammered shares in the social media giant after it reported slower revenue growth in the second quarter after markets closed on Wednesday. The results fell short of Wall Street expectations as the company continues to grapple with privacy issues.Subsequently, in overnight trading, the company\u0027s shares plunged 20 per cent, a figure that was then reflected when markets opened Thursday morning.Facebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that  new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.In midday trading Thursday, the company\u0027s market value (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the value of a single stock), fell by more than $122 billion.That means that in one day, just the decline in Facebook\u0027s market value is roughly the entire market value of McDonald\u0027s or Nike, give or take a few billion. And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.    The sharp decline eradicated about $128 billion off the company\u0027s value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of Twitter IncAt one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Tech firms suffer share price slumps as Facebook loses $120...Facebook shareholders try to fire Mark Zuckerberg as...Facebook executives defend hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027...Facebook\u0027s market value plummets by $150 BILLION in just two...Share this articleFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion.           Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s fortune also took a $16 billion hit in the first five minutes of trading on Thursday as shares in his social media company plunged 19 percent to $175.30          Monthly active users came in at 2.23 billion, which fell short of analysts\u0027 estimated 2.25 billion    Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, had combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on Wednesday  Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre.

Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Guru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, HBO has ordered a \u0027handful\u0027 of episodes, which began shooting in Los Angeles at West Hollywood\u0027s Barber Surgeons Guild last week.The show will premiere on HBO at 11pm on August 28.In one part of the preview, James can seen discussing the stress of parenthood: specifically watching his sons follow in his hardwood footstep. He also admitted to being an overly-competitive parent.  \u0027I didn\u0027t get into an argument with an AAU dad,\u0027 James said when talking about seeing his son, LeBron Jr., play youth basketball. \u0027I got into an argument with an AAU mom.\u0027James also confessed that he regretted giving his oldest son the \u0027Jr.\u0027 moniker, and gave a little window into his reasoning: \u0027When I was younger, obviously I didn\u0027t have a dad, my whole thing was when I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr. I\u0027m gonna do everything that this man didn\u0027t do.\u0027SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO            James (right) and New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (left) on the set of The Shop  All hail The King!

That\u0027s how The Shop became an idea.\u0027It\u0027s not yet clear how many episodes HBO will broadcast, or if James will appear throughout the series.          Snoop Dogg, a native of Southern California, will welcome James to the neighborhood on HBO  WNBA superstar Candace Parker (left) and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett (right) will also appear in the early episodes of The Shop on HBO, which premieres in August           Jon Stewart asked  James how he deals with watching his children follow in his footsteps According to THR, James will appear in at least the first three episodes.Of course, James\u0027s availability next year will be determined by how far he and his new Lakers teammates get into the Western Conference Playoffs.\u0027We\u0027ll do it as frequently as the conversation warrants,\u0027 says Peter Nelson, executive vice president of HBO Sports. \u0027It\u0027s LeBron\u0027s baby, so he very much wants to do it. And he wants to do it as much as possible.\u0027          Another former Giants wide receiver, Victor Cruz, also made an appearance in the HBO trailer for the new show, \u0027The Shop\u0027 James\u0027s SpringHill Entertainment has several projects underway with HBO, including a multi-part documentary on Muhammad Ali, and something about student athletes, which will premiere on October 2 and focus on the NCAA\u0027s controversial rules regarding amateurism.The Shop gives the boxing-centric HBO Sports another avenue to reach new audiences.\u0027Sports for us is really about a lens into socioeconomic, political, cultural issues and ideas around virtuosity in competition,\u0027 says Nelson.\u0027The objective,\u0027 Nelson continued, \u0027is candor. On the one hand, the barbershop as a place historically of secular communion, and on the other hand of the athletes and artist who have achieved this certain level of excellence who want to get in a room and a setting to talk like that with each other because a dearth of forms like that where they can really feel porous and honest with one other. And so it\u0027s less about let\u0027s leverage these names and these relationships and can we get this person or that person.

That is compared with Virgin\u0027s closest equivalent \u0027Economy Delight\u0027 which costs an extra £50 for 34 inches.Icelandic low-cost airline WOW Air sells fares to New York JFK via Reykjavik from £220. Standard economy seats are a bit tighter at 29-31 inches, compared with a standard 31 on BA.           But an upgrade to WOW\u0027s XL seats, offering 32-33 inches of legroom, costs an extra £47. And XXL seats, with a cavernous 35-37 inches, are an additional £61.Which? Travel said: \u0027It\u0027s not a bad little investment given that BA\u0027s extra legroom starts at £50, and fares are usually higher than those from WOW Air.\u0027Researchers said there are fewer options to upgrade on short-haul, but passengers should not assume the budget carriers have the smallest seats.While both Tui and Thomas Cook airlines have a knee-crushing seat pitch of just 28 inches, it\u0027s a different story with Ryanair. The budget carrier offers the same legroom as BA on many routes, although seat width with Ryanair is a snug 17 inches. The research said both Ryanair and Easyjet have scrapped reclining seats as part of a fare-slashing exercise and BA is also set to join them later this year on some European routes.Currently, there is no law detailing the minimum dimensions of a plane seat. Instead, a maximum passenger load is stipulated for each aircraft, based on whether it can be fully evacuated within 90 seconds –even if half of its exits are disabled. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/00/4E92362B00000578-0-image-a-8_1532649481699.jpg","title":"Pupils summer holiday jobs prepare work says Esther McVey DWP secretary","story":"    Work and pensioner secretary Esther McVey (pictured last week) said part-time jobs are vital to equip the younger generation with skills that will enable post-Brexit Britain to thriveWriting in The Daily Telegraph, Miss McVey warned a \u0027cultural shift\u0027 has seen teenagers focus on education and training at the expense of earning extra money and gaining vital work experience.Miss McVey added that summer and Saturday jobs prepare young people for successful careers in later life, teaching vital \u0027soft skills\u0027 such as customer service, problem solving and time management.She wrote: \u0027As we enter this post-Brexit era, I want to make sure that young people are as prepared as ever for the workplace and I want to restore the merits that summer jobs can bring.\u0027Child benefit reforms mean tens of thousands of stay at home...Share this articleMiss McVey, who will launch the campaign at Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest today, acknowledged that while a summer job may not be \u0027a dream job for life\u0027, they are \u0027firmly connected to having a successful future\u0027.Statistics show that as well as providing extra cash, part-time jobs increase the likelihood of teenagers and children finding work later in life.Two-thirds of employers say experience is important when recruiting, and young people who have had part-time jobs tend to earn 12 to 15 per cent more than those who did not.

Pictured, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (left) and Montenegrian President Milo DjukanovicThis was a far-fetched view at the time of the referendum, and today it is plainly false.Illiberal forces are advancing across the European continent. Hard-Right governments have strengthened their hold on power in Poland and Hungary, while in Austria and Italy, parties with links to interwar fascism play a pivotal role in ruling coalitions.Cost of fruit, vegetables, and milk could soar if there is...Share this articleThe Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia all have powerful far-Right parties in, or close to entering, government.Sweden, Finland and Denmark are in the same position.But it is in Germany that the advance of the far-Right is most striking.          In Austria and Italy, parties with links to interwar fascism play a pivotal role in ruling coalitions. Pictured, Italy\u0027s deputy Prime Minister Matteo SalviniOnly a few months ago, Remainers were pointing to the solidity of Angela Merkel\u0027s Germany as evidence of the folly of Brexit. Led by this liberal icon, who had welcomed more than a million migrants into the country, the most powerful European state seemed to be the embodiment of a continent no longer shaped by national identities and borders.That picture of the future has been consigned to the past. Merkel lingers on, but she is a spent force. Under electoral threat from the far-Right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, she has decided to institute border controls to prevent any further influx of migrants.Whether these controls will be effective is unclear, but similar or more severe restrictions are likely to be imposed by other European countries.Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland will act to block any inflows of migrants across their borders. The Schengen agreement on freedom of movement, which the European Commission sees as one of the cornerstones of the EU and treats as a red line in Brexit negotiations, is collapsing.Merkel\u0027s decision to set up border controls is also unlikely to stem the advance of the far-Right in Germany.Before the election last year, the then German vice chancellor and foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel told Der Spiegel that if the AfD entered the Bundestag, Nazis would speak in the German parliament for the first time in 70 years. When the AfD did just that, all other German parties vowed to refuse to work with them.          Angela Merkel\u0027s decision to set up border controls is also unlikely to stem the advance of the far- Right in GermanyBut Merkel has survived only because these parties fear the further advance of the AfD that would almost certainly follow if she stepped down and triggered another election.It seems to me a safe bet that some years from now Germany will follow Italy and admit the far-Right into government.Leavers are routinely abused for being unrealistic, and there may be some who have had an over-simple view of Britain\u0027s post-Brexit place in an unstable world. But to my mind, doctrinaire Remainers are far more unrealistic about the stability of the EU.Soon after the referendum, I argued that Brexit was only the first in a succession of electoral revolts that would break out across the continent. Because parties of the centre identified so closely with the European project, the danger was these revolts would be led by the far-Right. This is happening. Yet few Remainers seem to have noticed.Some may point to the French president Emmanuel Macron as proof of a counter-trend.But Macron\u0027s fate is uncertain. It should not be forgotten that over a third of those who voted in the final round of the presidential elections last year opted for Marine Le Pen, despite the National Rally party leader reverting to her father\u0027s racist rhetoric.If Macron\u0027s unpopular economic policies fail to produce positive results for voters soon, it will be the far-Right — and maybe the far-Left, which is equally hostile to the EU — that will benefit.          Some may point to the French president Emmanuel Macron as proof of a counter-trendRemainers respond to the advance of the far-Right by demanding \u0027more Europe\u0027 — a more determined move to a transnational European state. They reject the suggestion — I would say fact — that it is this very project that has fuelled the advance of anti-liberal forces across the continent.By attempting to remove immigration from the jurisdiction of national governments, the EU has left many people with the sense they have no control over their lives.The result of pushing for a transnational government that most Europeans do not want has been the rise of the worst kinds of nationalism.That is why borders are reappearing throughout the EU.Of course, bien-pensant Remainers will say this is an expression of popular racism. But if you call anyone who demands democratic control of immigration a \u0027racist\u0027, do not be surprised if many of them elect real racists. One of Italy\u0027s new leaders is calling for a register of Roma people. Europe has heard this sort of thing before.For its most devoted disciples, there is nothing wrong with the European project. It simply has not yet been applied in a pure manner.But isn\u0027t this what every blinkered ideologue says about their fantasy of a new world?There are still people who will tell you that the former Soviet Union began to practise large-scale repression only under Stalin, who distorted Lenin\u0027s original vision.Historical facts show this is not so — mass arrests, systematic killing and the Gulag all began under Lenin.The indifference to facts of totalitarian ideologies is well known. What is new is a type of liberalism that has also immunised itself against facts.Liberals like to think they are empiricists — in other words, they learn from experience. But ideological Remainers have learnt nothing from the march of the far-Right across the European continent.No fact will ever dislodge their conviction that Europe represents freedom and progress and Britain the reactionary past.No doubt Britain has many faults. A virulent new strain of anti-Semitism has emerged in politics — mostly on the far- Left. But we have nothing like the large far-Right movements that exist in nearly every continental European country.Unlike some European states, Britain remains a liberal democracy.The upshot of Brexit is unclear. Some believe it may be derailed. I think this is unlikely. But if Brexit is overturned it will be ironic. Under the banner of a march to a more liberal future, Britain will blunder back into a rerun of a dark European past.John Gray is Emeritus Professor of European Thought at the London School of Economics.

I am just fine.\u0027\u0027No, you could have knocked me over with a feather. My boyfriend saw it. I thought she was Middle Eastern,\u0027 she said. She was fired on May 29 in light of her tweet, however Barr claims that her termination broke her contract.\u0027I want to tell you this. I walked away from that show despite the fact I had a contract that protected me from getting in trouble with tweets,\u0027 she said. She explained that under her contract she had \u002724 hours to correct any mistakes\u0027.   She posted the jabbing tweet at 2:45am on May 29. After she came under fire for it, she deleted the tweet. But the damage was done and ABC canceled her eponymous show and Barr was fired just hours later.The actress adds that she was prevented from clearing her name.\u0027I asked them to let me go on The View and other shows and explain and correct that I didn\u0027t say what they were putting out there. They said no,\u0027 Barr said.          Barr said she tried to clear the air by going on The View to quell the Twitter controversy, but was denied from doing so           She added that she walked away from the show without causing a fight so that staff and cast members on the show wouldn\u0027t lose their jobs Instead of fighting, Barr told Hannity that she walked away because she didn\u0027t want staff and cast members on the show to lose their job and she even signed for the show to continue without her.   \u0027I am for working people. I could fight this. No, it\u0027s going to be part of the repentance. I will just walk away,\u0027 she said. When she was later asked if she\u0027s still on Twitter Barr said: \u0027My kids took it away from me.\u0027Hannity pointed out she could get another phone, to which she smiled and said \u0027Yes, I know\u0027. She has been active on Twitter following the May 29 tweet. Speaking on the tweet she said: \u0027I made a mistake, obviously. It cost me everything. My life\u0027s work. Everything. I made a mistake. I have paid the price for it. No, I didn\u0027t know -- like a lot of Americans including a lot of people of all times, they didn\u0027t know either.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/07/4E93DB5300000578-5998347-image-a-9_1532674416414.jpg","title":"Hairdresser leaves five year old looking like Dumb Dumber character","story":"    Candice Haines, 33, was left in tears after her five-year-old son Kobi (pictured) was given a \u0027Dumb and Dumber\u0027 haircut after a hairdresser botched his fringe on July 13A mother has been left in tears after her five-year-old son was given a \u0027Dumb and Dumber\u0027 haircut after a hairdresser botched the boy\u0027s fringe.Candice Haines, 33, was gobsmacked when her son, Kobi, returned from a Birmingham hairdressers with her father, Ron Collis, 64, on Friday, July 13.The distraught mother claims she asked for \u0027short back and sides\u0027 but Kobi came home looking like the character Lloyd played by Jim Carey in the Dumb and Dumber film.Despite initially bursting into tears after seeing her son\u0027s uneven haircut, the mother-of-three had to pretend she liked his new hairdo to avoid upsetting the young boy. Ms Haines said she was left red faced when trying to explain to other mothers that Kobi\u0027s new £10 hairstyle was from a botched hair salon trip and not her own work.The mother claims she doesn\u0027t know the name of the new Birmingham salon but will not allow her father to take him back anytime soon.The full time mother said: \u0027When Kobi walked through the door with my dad I couldn\u0027t believe it.

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Guru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Even in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 – when 100 per cent mortgages were offered to home buyers without a deposit – the country did not reach a point where the average household was a net borrower.\u0027In a sign that families are losing the habit of putting money aside for a rainy day, the proportion of disposable income that is saved has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. This is the third lowest since records began in 1963 and down from almost 15 per cent in the 1990s.The ONS said the typical household\u0027s outgoings were £900 higher than their incomings last year.The incomings relate to salaries, pensions, benefits and other income before tax and other costs. Corbyn ally Billy Bragg claims Jews have \u0027work to do\u0027 to...Boris Johnson \u0027held secret talks\u0027 with Trump\u0027s former...Share this articleThe outgoings include everything from tax, housing costs such as mortgages and rent and bills, to food, clothes, fuel and furniture.Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell investments, said: \u0027Economic growth founded on rising debt is clearly not sustainable and if this continues into the long term it would be profoundly worrying.\u0027One obvious reason for this is the interest rate environment we have experienced in recent years, encouraging people to borrow more and spend rather than save at the paltry rates offered through bank accounts and cash ISAs.\u0027Using a separate set of figures, the ONS report showed that the richest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income – after taxes and housing costs are accounted for – of more than £78,000 last year. These families spent less than £39,000 of that sum.By contrast, the poorest 10 per cent of households had a disposable income of just £5,000 but spent nearly £13,000.Jane Goodland, of wealth manager Quilter, said: \u0027This ONS research is yet another stark reminder of just how vulnerable the average UK household has become in terms of their financial wellbeing.

The results fell short of Wall Street expectations as the company continues to grapple with privacy issues.Subsequently, in overnight trading, the company\u0027s shares plunged 20 per cent, a figure that was then reflected when markets opened Thursday morning.Facebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that  new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.In midday trading Thursday, the company\u0027s market value (the number of outstanding shares multiplied by the value of a single stock), fell by more than $122 billion.That means that in one day, just the decline in Facebook\u0027s market value is roughly the entire market value of McDonald\u0027s or Nike, give or take a few billion. And it far exceeds to total market value of major U.S. multinational corporations such as General Electric, Eli Lilly or Caterpillar.But the company still has a total market value close to $511 billion, which exceeds the annual gross domestic product of countries like Poland, Belgium and Iran.The $15.8 billion in net worth that Zuckerberg stands to lose in the move is equal to the wealth of the world\u0027s 81st-richest person, currently Japanese businessman Takemitsu Takizaki, according to Forbes real time data. The tumbling stock prices comes as:The social media giant released its financial results on Wednesday reporting slower revenue growth in the second quarterShareholders filed a proposal to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook, citing \u0027mishandling\u0027 of scandals including user privacy and election meddlingFacebook executives defended hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027 Infowars on its platform in a heated exchange with reportersThe parents of a Sandy Hook massacre victim begged Zuckerberg to remove hateful and harassing comments posted by conspiracy theoristsDescribing the announcements as \u0027bombshells\u0027, Baird analysts said the issues were to a large degree \u0027self-inflicted\u0027.Facebook executives made investors nervous on Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.    The sharp decline eradicated about $128 billion off the company\u0027s value - or nearly four times the entire market capitalization of Twitter IncAt one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Tech firms suffer share price slumps as Facebook loses $120...Facebook shareholders try to fire Mark Zuckerberg as...Facebook executives defend hosting Fox News and \u0027atrocious\u0027...Facebook\u0027s market value plummets by $150 BILLION in just two...Share this articleFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion.           Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s fortune also took a $16 billion hit in the first five minutes of trading on Thursday as shares in his social media company plunged 19 percent to $175.30          Monthly active users came in at 2.23 billion, which fell short of analysts\u0027 estimated 2.25 billion    Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, had combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on Wednesday  Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre.

These two are making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road’Murga is Argentinian street theatre that combines dance with percussion. The first time I heard the hypnotic drumbeat of a performance was in a park in Buenos Aires. I walked towards it and watched the dancers as they moved from the first simple steps to the intense high kicks the performances culminate in. I was hooked. I wanted to know everything about it.For ordinary, working class people, murga plays an important role. Austerity means it’s becoming much harder to live in Argentina. Murga gives them something to look forward to, an escape.Each area of Buenos Aires has its own murga group, with their own colours. In February, throughout carnival season, they travel from neighbourhood to neighbourhood on weekends, performing well into the night. They travel around in these knackered old school buses to makeshift stages on streets shut down for the evening. In some places, the audience is on fire, it’s exciting. There is a real buzz when the drums start. The sound is addictive the audience gets lost in it and even though it’s so hot and so late, the performers give it their all.I shot this in 2013, while trailing a local troupe I’d befriended a few years earlier. It was about 6.45 in the evening, and it was very hot, very humid. Everyone was moving a little slowly, which I think this picture captures. The troupe – about 150 dancers and drummers – had gathered at the director’s house, which transforms into a community centre of sorts.I came across this private moment in the kitchen. Someone had made stew for dinner, in that big pot, and two dancers were making ham and cheese sandwiches for the road. The boy had put the knife down to concentrate on talking to the girl. They were having an intense conversation. I liked how they were mirroring each other’s body language, unconsciously, beautifully. The composition reminded me of Dutch paintings.In the room next door, people were doing their makeup and making last-minute adjustments to their costumes – men with their coat-tails and smart hats, girls with short skirts. Elsewhere, others were loading drums into buses. I liked how this quiet, fleeting moment, stood in direct contrast to the flurry of activity all around. I went back the following year with printed copies of the image to give the boy and the girl, but they were no longer members. I never found out their names.Training: BA in fine art at Norwich School of Art and MA in contemporary art theory at Goldsmiths College, London.Influences: “Vermeer, Alessandra Sanguinetti, and many other photographers, artists and film directors.”High point: “Photographing Somaliland’s presidential elections recently for the NGO Saferworld.

But right now, what Stohl really wants to do is make all the women in this room understand what a superhero is.“What makes a character strong is not necessarily physical power,” she says to the excitable crowd. “I feel the human sentiment in our stories very strongly. We still have a lot of work to do for representation in heroes but I’m convinced our teams and our fans will demand it – we must. That’s why it’s one of the best times to be a woman hero, to be a trans hero, to be a gay hero.” The whole tent erupts into cheers and applause. Stohl slumps back in her chair, smiling and satisfied.Stohl has spent her whole life quietly shaking up patriarchies. Born in Los Angeles into a staunchly conservative Mormon household, as a child she was “not exactly encouraged to be a writer”. But after falling in love with Susan Cooper’s The Dark Is Rising series, she was determined to write regardless, studying literature at Amherst college, creative writing at UEA in England and then gaining a literature master’s at Stanford.Now best known as the co-author of the Beautiful Creatures young adult novels, Stohl got her break writing video games, including Activision’s much-loved Spider-Man tie-in, then ran her own development studio for 10 gruelling years (“Every day was an acid bath you’re just trying to make payroll.”) In 2016, Marvel approached her to write a couple of novels based on the Avengers’ pitiless assassin Black Widow. But Sana Amanat, Marvel’s director of content and character development who was also overseeing the studio’s ersity record, had bigger plans for her. “Under her purview, they’ve gone from having zero female-led titles to more than 20,” says Stohl. “She called me and said, ‘I think you should write a monthly comic and I think it should be Captain Marvel.’ Marvel wanted to set out a clear origin story – that was my job.”Created by Stan Lee and Gene Colan, the original Captain Marvel was a man – or more accurately a male, alien soldier – named Mar-Vell, who was sent to Earth to observe humanity at the dawn of its space-travel ambitions. With super-strength and the ability to fly, he was the closest Marvel came to DC’s Superman – and like Superman, the character caught the romantic attention of Earthling women, including one US air force major named Carol Danvers. Danvers later gained her own super-powers when she was caught in an explosion involving an alien artefact, and in 1977, amid the rise of second-wave feminism, she resurfaced in a new comic series as Ms Marvel, before finally taking on the title Captain Marvel in 2012.It’s the Danvers version of Captain Marvel that we’ll see portrayed by Oscar-winner Brie Larson on screen next year. While her powers are impressive (flight, super-strength, the ability to project energy with the force of a nuclear explosion), it’s her story that is interesting. Danvers grew up with an abusive father who forbade her from attending university, and after joining the Avengers, she was abducted and raped by a supervillain named Marcus Immortus, in one of the most controversial storylines in Marvel’s history. Later, she lost her powers, regained them, and battled alcoholism and anxiety. If any character symbolises the troubled history of women in mainstream comics, it’s Danvers.“I’m interested in this idea of who gets to be the hero,” says Stohl. “Carol was literally a side character. She was there to be a pretty girl. She has a very messy hero’s journey, but then that’s also the journey of women in comics. That’s what it was like for me and a lot of other women writers – you don’t necessarily come in to the scene thinking you’re a star or even a main character. As any woman will tell you, there’s almost a biological response to seeing something like Rey in Star Wars wielding a lightsaber or Wonder Woman doing Matrix-style bullet-dodging. We don’t get those experiences very often.”But Stohl won’t be shying away from the underlying vulnerability of the character. The Life of Captain Marvel begins with Danvers suffering a panic attack – triggered by Fathers’ Day – and then heading back to her family home to confront her past. “I think people who are vulnerable but still rise to the challenge are more heroic,” she says. “Marvel is very good at this: Tony Stark is one of my favourite characters to write, and he’s as cracked as they come. Peter Parker is a mess, Thor is a mess, Hulk is a mess. The second I took over the Captain Marvel run, I sent Carol to therapy on board the Alpha Flight space station. I feel like, my God, you’d be in therapy the rest of your life if you had to do half the things these people do!”After her Celsius talk, Stohl spends a long time chatting with fans, signing copies of her books and making herself available for selfies. Elsewhere, she runs two major young adult fiction festivals in the US, and lectures on creative writing at schools around the world: when she talks about empowering young women writers, she really lives it. As both she and her interpretation of Captain Marvel move into the spotlight, she knows she’s likely to face a rocky time. Progressive ideas and creators aren’t always welcome in comics: the arrival of a Pakistani Ms Marvel and a female Thor in 2014 generated an intense online backlash. In 2016, Marvel writer Chelsea Cain was hounded off Twitter when her character Mockingbird wore a T-shirt bearing the phrase, “Ask me about my feminist agenda.”But to this, she shrugs. “It’s a great time to be a female creator, but that doesn’t make it an easy time,” she says. “I’m getting through to people in vulnerable populations every time I write a strong girl or a strong LGBT character. Kids are seeing themselves as Wonder Woman, they’ll see themselves as Captain Marvel. Even if there is a backlash, young people are listening, they want it. This is for them.”• The Life of Captain Marvel #1 is out now, with monthly issues to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0598da09e3ebe592d48f794d8359c1b92b7321d4/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6df311cb72ab1ba2e2a514cab327c3e","title":"children reading summer holidays","story":"Summer is the perfect time to get children reading, but what if they refuse? Authors and experts reveal tips and tricks for every age group • And if you need some inspiration, take a look at these modern classicsEach year when we went on holiday, my parents would treat us to a Summer Special comic. The Beano for my older brother, Blue Jeans for me. I can still feel the paper stiff with salt, the pages carrying the sweet coconut tang of Hawaiian Tropic. I didn’t care if the stories were seldom truly special, because something else was. Reading and pleasure went together in a way that they didn’t at any other time of our lives.Summer is the perfect time to encourage children to read. Books draw us into other worlds. A child who reads on holiday enters one new world inside another. But you don’t need to travel to make reading feel adventurous. Reading will build a new world anywhere. You can make this idea three-dimensional for younger children by creating a reading den.My children are seven and 10 and have yet to outgrow our shared story time. We always have a chapter book on the go, even if some weeks it goes more slowly than others. To keep things interesting, we change our reading spots. We have cowered from Cruella de Vil under blankets on the floor, and zipped ourselves inside a tent to read Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden. Switching the time of a shared story is another good way to make it transporting. Stories that are too scary for bedtime (The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall, Coraline by Neil Gaiman, for us) can seem brilliantly subversive in the daytime.A good way to start a long summer of reading is to take children to the library and sign them up for the Summer Reading Challenge. The children’s author and poet Joseph Coelho took part in a precursor to this initiative when he was 10, and still recalls the thrill of nudging his little spaceship counter along the Velcro backing, one notch for each book read. “It turned reading into a sport,” he says. And that turned him into a reader.The challenges of leading children to books alter as they age. But whether they are four or 14, the first rule of encouraging them to read is to read yourself. “When a parent says, ‘I can’t get my child to read’, the first thing we ask is, ‘Do they ever see you read?’,” says Sue Wilkinson, who founded the Reading Agency charity. It’s a good question. I tend to read at bedtime I’m pretty sure my children know I like books, but I’m less sure whether they actually witness me in the act. “They’ve got to see you hanging around the house with a book or a newspaper,” says novelist Claire Fuller. Writer Lara Feigel has a six-year-old son whose school advises that boys benefit from seeing male role models read. “And not on their phone,” Feigel adds. Even before her son knew his alphabet, she would give him a book and they would sit side by side on the sofa he would turn the pages “and pretend to read, next to me reading”. Reading thrives on intimacy.The second rule is to give a child freedom of choice. Stop trying to leave the book you wish them to read in strategic places. For novelist Ross Raisin, this approach is akin to “holding a book in front of a child as if it’s broccoli and telling them how good it will be for them”. He makes this mistake with his own daughter sometimes, “and she never reads those books”.And yet, how many of us have hovered in the bookshop or library while a child’s hands swoop to yet another book by the same author? “We’ve all been guilty of saying, ‘Pick something else!’” says Liz Pichon, author of the Tom Gates series. I have said those very words to my son when he has picked up yet another Tom Gates. But as Pichon says: “The way to suck the joy out of reading is to make them read something.” So let them choose. It’s the reading that counts.Build the bedtime story into a routine. Take it in turns to choose books: this gives a child free will, and you a chance to share your own favourites. Dramatise your reading: change the pace, the tone, the volume. Share out characters so everyone has a voice. Even readers as young as five can enjoy independence. “Let the child read on their own if they can’t get to sleep, allowing them to establish an independent, slightly rebellious intimacy with it,” novelist Diana Evans advises. For readers at the lower end of this age bracket, reading can be tiring. Feigel bargains with her son: they read alternate pages. For Raisin: “Oral storytelling is important too, and can excite an interest in stories that lends itself to more reading. In both my school groups and my own children’s beds, I try to encourage telling stories, making them up. That can be a bit of a challenge for the parent at the end of a day ... but if you involve your child, letting them take over at points, or adding ingredients, it doesn’t really matter if it’s a load of nonsense. Play is better than prescription – something the school system often ignores – so have fun with reading and let the child lead.”But some children still show fear around books. Coelho, who has spent years visiting schools with the Reading Agency, suggests a game can help. “Simple things, like finding the name of an illustrator, a certain coloured spine, or a book with more than 100 pages.” Use your bookshelves at home, or go to the library. This type of challenge helps “to make books themselves objects for fun”, Coelho says.After a reading session, I sometimes quiz my children: what was unusual about the baker’s feet? How did Emil keep his money safe? What plant grew around the door to the secret garden? Or halt the reading at a really exciting place in the narrative and invite each listener to guess what’s going to happen next.For children who love screens, show them the Reading Agency’s book sorter, which holds 825,000 recommendations from children. “Programme” the sorter, click the button and see what titles it serves up… Then go and find them in the library or online.Children at the lower end of this bracket can still enjoy a bedtime story. “It’s a bit like breastfeeding. It can go on much longer than people think,” Craig says. Let the reading evolve to accommodate a child’s changing life. Craig read to her son, who read less independently than her daughter, until he was 12. She searched for things they both enjoyed – “a lot of which was fantasy. The whole of The Lord of the Rings.”My children and I read together only a few times a week now. We snuggle up or lean on each other instead of sitting on laps. We take it in turn to read in different bedrooms. Sometimes I’ll read a few pages and they will read on alone, then we all catch up the next night. The bedtime story is morphing into a mini book club. Building a conversation around books means that reading plays a part in our lives even when we don’t have a book to hand. And occasionally my daughter, who is 10, reads to me. It’s lovely to listen you get to hear how the words sound to your child, which will not be how they sound to you.If a child doesn’t want to read at all, don’t try to foist books on them. “Sometimes it’s about meeting them at their level, and bit by bit widening their horizon,” Coelho says. The best way to reach a football-mad child may be to introduce him or her to the books of Tom Palmer (highly recommended), but if all books are flat-out unappealing, try sharing match reports of their favourite teams. This approach can work with children who love gaming too. “Pretty much every game has a downloadable manual,” Coelho says. “You can get them to read about how best to play the game. They are still learning the importance of reading.” From there, you might be able to lead them on to fiction inspired by computer games. And if they don’t want to turn the pages themselves, Pichon suggests an audiobook. This can also work well when a parent lacks the time or energy to read, and appeals across different age groups.Finally, don’t begrudge children their rereading. Fuller says that her son read The Lord of the Rings “for about 10 years and nothing else. Which I was quite happy about because he was reading, and it made packing for holidays much easier.” Rereading is common, and proof of the comfort a book can give. “As long as they’re reading, that’s all that matters,” BookTrust advises. However, if they have a passion for a particular author and might be interested in reading similar titles, try BookTrust’s What to Read After online tool.By now your child is probably barely talking to you, so it can feel a tough ask to engage them on the subject of books. But try to keep the dialogue going. Fuller’s children are at university but she likes to ask, “‘What’s happened in your book today?’ My husband and I have that conversation at dinner every day. Perhaps the question will lead on to a discussion.”Recommendations from older siblings and non-parental role models hold huge sway in this age group. “They tend to reject what parents dangle in front of them,” says Craig, who says her daughter gave Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games to her son. “They need to feel that books are their own discovery.” It’s important not to judge your child’s taste.For Craig, overcoming a child’s reluctance to read “is a battle in which low cunning, as well as wild enthusiasm, must be deployed”. At the lower end of this age bracket, adult books can exercise an incredible lure. Craig, for instance, used to leave Mary Renault books lying around the house. “People forget that as well as being incredibly scholarly they have got a lot of sex in them. If you say to a 14-year-old boy, ‘I don’t know if you can read that yet because it’s got some stuff in there for adults’, they do, of course, go off and read it.”With so many competing demands for a teenager’s attention, it can take a hard line to make reading happen. “If all else fails, I’m afraid it’s so important that I would say, ‘Guys, we are going to have 20 minutes every afternoon or evening reading time’,” psychologist Linda Blair says. “You’re going to read, and I’m going to read, and that’s that. And they will.” Six weeks, she adds, is the time it takes to change a habit. But what if a child – near enough an adult now – refuses? “Bribe them,” she says. “That shocks a lot of parents. But I say to them, ‘Why do you go to work?’ Make it worth their while. Make reading contingent on a reward. ‘You can stay out later on Friday night.’ Whatever works for the family.” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2975015020188ced14660f838f5a22b77264d2e0/35_54_4165_2499/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318b3660688a783f5b3b75beec136751","title":"bp to buy bhp us shale oil and gas assets for 105bn","story":"Deal gives British energy giant ‘access to some of the best acreage in the best basins’BP has agreed to buy US shale oil and gasfields from the Anglo-Australian miner BHP for $10.5bn (£8bn), in the UK firm’s biggest acquisition in nearly two decades.Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, lauded the deal as transformational and industry watchers said the move significantly beefed up the company’s US shale presence, which was small compared to peers.The acquisition will boost BP’s US oil and gas production by nearly a fifth and marks a new period of growth for the company, which is emerging after years under the $65bn burden of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.In total, 470,000 acres of assets are covered in the deal, including fields in the Permian in west Texas, the Eagle Ford in south Texas and Haynesville in east Texas and Louisiana. Analysts said Eagle Ford was the most valuable of the three because of its scale and economics, while the Permian offered the greatest long-term promise.BHP bought the fields in 2011 but has struggled to make them work, putting them up for sale last August.BP said it believed its approach would differ by bringing $350m of synergies from its other US operations and capital efficiencies.The UK oil giant was “not desperate to do a deal” he added but BP believed the quality of the resources made the acquisition worthwhile.After the deal is completed BP’s US production will climb from 744,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 885,000 boed.“BP was previously underweight to US tight oil compared to its peers. This deal transforms BP’s US business,” Maxim Petrov, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said.BP said it was making “conservative assumptions” about how much oil and gas could be pumped to begin with, given regional bottlenecks around infrastructure such as pipelines. “We think the infrastructure will get built out over the next two years,” Looney said.The acquisition will be fully paid for in cash and is being part-funded by the company esting its interests in the Greater Kuparuk Area in Alaska, which will raise $5-6bn.The scale of BP’s deal dwarfs its recent $200m investment in Europe’s biggest solar company and its £130m purchase of the UK’s largest electric car charging network."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2e61b0f9414759a03179f5ea895594ec02d61d/59_0_1203_722/master/1203.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=308f6bea6e4df74615987806a34c126a","title":"can artists save st petersburgs crumbling palaces","story":"Creative businesses and artistic collectives have breathed life back into St Petersburg’s historic buildings – and, they hope, some of its cultural gloryDowntown Saint Petersburg is street after street of extravagant mansions, tenement buildings and palaces built at the height of the Russian empire. Not all have managed to maintain their splendour since that golden era, however – though you might say there’s something romantic about the gentle sense of decay.If St Petersburg’s history as Russia’s cultural capital is etched out in its architecture, over time, many of those etchings have become faded: its mansions and palaces have been turned into hotels or condominiums others have fallen into disuse and disrepair. Approximately 15,000 buildings date to before 1914 and most of them badly need renovation. The state hasn’t been the one to answer that call.“It happened at the time when Dmitry Medvedev was president – the economy and quality of life were growing,” says Alexander Basalygin, founder of the BS Art Development. There was a growing demand, he said, “for a new life of aesthetics – and public spaces in particular”.Two years ago his group, a collective of artists, bought one of St Petersburg’s crumbling mansions – and they weren’t the only ones to do so. Between 2013 and 2016, around 20 new art-oriented spaces opened in St Petersburg each year, from galleries and private museums to co-working spaces. Now there are upwards of 200 creative spaces in the city, located in everything from former palaces to old Soviet warehouses. Collectively, St Petersburg’s artists have taken it upon themselves to save its historic buildings, one at a time.The mansion adopted by Basalygin’s group is an 18th-century manor on the Fontanka river that was once home to the Golitsyns, a family of Russian nobles. For years it had been abandoned and decayed, despite being the meeting point of the well-known Arzamas literary society in the 19th century. The BS group renovated the building, subided it, added facilities and renamed it the Golitsyn Loft. “Four years ago I had a dream about this place. When we came to inspect it, I realised that my dream came true,” says Oksana Kazakova, who runs the ID39 beauty space, one of the new tenants. “We saved the plasterwork, chimney, antique doors as best we could – though we had to sell our car to finish it.”At 7,000 sq m, Golitsyn Loft’s five buildings form the largest creative space in the city. It has become a thriving hub of creativity, filled with designer showrooms, bars, architectural studios, barber shops, tattoo studios and poetry workshops. Just 10 minutes from Golitsyn is a three-storey building on Bolshaya Konushennaya street, built in the art nouveau style. Its intricately carved ceilings were falling apart in 2015 when Tsarchitektor, a youth-oriented arts group, moved in. The building now holds bars, secondhand shops, and pottery and jewellery workshops. Nearby is Palma, another multi-use building with architect and design studios and rehearsal rooms, formerly home to German craftsmen in the 18th and 19th centuries and a mass of cheap dormitories, a gym, a chess club and a ballroom that lay ruined after the second world war.While the Palma was bought by private investors, many of the renovations have been paid for through public fundraisers. After a fire in 2002 destroyed much of the Annenkirche, an 18th-century Lutheran church on the Neva River, the building was abandoned to trees and rot. But in 2014 a group of young artists held an exhibition in its crumbling interior, and wanted to do more.These artistic clusters come and go, giving a sense of transience to this aspect of St Petersburg’s urban life. According to the ITMO university, the average life of artists’ spaces is just four years, due to the inevitable price hikes in property values when “building owners decide that they can take better advantage than an artistic space”, says Alexandra Nenko, a researcher at ITMO. Nevertheless, the artists are doing more than most, including the government, to keep the city’s historic buildings alive. “Ideas and the creation of cultural products continue to grow in importance,” Nenko says. “Creative industries need their own place ... I am sure that they will continue to absorb abandoned mansions and palaces of St Petersburg.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b6e59dfe233e2ce3fb26fcdd02a5c9fb49a9905/0_47_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb3adbe80380e144a6194ee14e2fc1a4","title":"britain african artists womad visa brexit","story":"Moonchild Sanelly oozes star quality. When musicians from Africa Express – the organisation I co-founded – went to South Africa earlier this year to make some recordings, they were blown away by her. A huge mop of blue hair, an engaging personality and distinctive vocals, she ended up on so many tracks that one visitor joked they were making her solo album. When the collective played in Johannesburg, Damon Albarn hailed an emerging superstar after she performed.But British audiences must wait to see this fabulous artist. For Moonchild is the latest African performer to fall foul of our “hostile environment” on migration, forcing her to cancel three planned shows in this country after spending almost £500 for the visa application. She handed over all the demanded documents, which range from checked bank statements through to insurance details, and took two days to collate, only to be seemingly tripped up on a financial discrepancy largely caused by fluctuating exchange rates.Her case is far from unique. Obtaining visas for non-European artists coming to Britain has long been a nightmare, even for world-famous stars. Two years ago Africa Express sought visas for 50 Syrians to tour a re-formed orchestra, one of the most stressful things I have ever attempted. Everything was still up in the air for a tour costing more than £500,000 just days before the first show – which was due to be joined by the likes of Paul Weller and Rachid Taha. Thankfully, it was well worth the effort in the end. But this gut-wrenching process seems to be getting tougher amid a rising tide of nationalism and post-Brexit paranoia.Chris Smith, the director of this weekend’s Womad festival, told the Radio Times that for the first time musicians had rejected invitations rather than face the “humiliation” of confronting Britain’s visa services. “Culture is being crushed as politicians lurch to the right,” he said. “My fear is the situation is only going to get worse.” Yet this is a time when ided communities need the soothing balm of art and unifying power of music reaching across borders more than ever.Those involved in promoting music from abroad swap horror stories. Womad had to cancel one act after British officials put the wrong date in their visas and shelled out £15,000 on emergency visas for another artist last year. One famous African group’s manager was shocked recently to find charges of almost £7,000 to obtain visas for his touring party – and these only last three months. “It is not really worth coming any more,” he told me sadly. This was echoed by a leading booking agent, who said artists were being deterred by the complexity, the costs and the lack of humanity in an outsourced system. “Often the officers on the borders don’t know their own rules but it’s the artists who get punished,” he added.It is bad enough that passports are handed over for weeks, preventing artists working, but then they must sit in hotels for days after flying across continents for biometric tests. These are, bear in mind, people from poorer parts of the planet trying to develop careers by visiting a nation that proclaims creative leadership and a desire to improve the world. Sadly, they are often frozen out by costs or confronted by condescending attitudes. I have heard also from Kenyan charity workers, Nigerian entrepreneurs and Ghanaian techies outraged at being treated like illegal immigrants when seeking visas to visit Britain for business from their fast-growing countries.Such issues pale beside bigger problems such as the soaring death rate of migrants crossing the Mediterranean amid the surge of fearful populism. But when artists from developing nations reject the platform to perform at one of our best-known festivals, this should be a warning sign. For it symbolises the hypocrisy of politicians who boast about global Britain, only to then tighten borders, rip off foreigners and treat visitors with contempt.Sadly, the message going out is that Britain is closed for business and culture – from some places at least.• Ian Birrell is co-founder of Africa Express, a collaborative music project"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8bcdc6bf1732e90bdefb3002c094aa06e2bf7e1/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d07db353af34b8fcad56fffbbae391b","title":"eu brexit weimar britain","story":"The EU must not impose a punitive exit agreement on the UK. The fallout from a resentful nation would be felt throughout the continentOver the next year or two we could witness the emergence of a rancid, angry Britain: a society riven by domestic isions and economic difficulties, let down by its ruling classes, fetid with humiliation and resentment. Any such country is a danger both to itself and to its neighbours. This prospect will come closest, fastest, if there is no deal on Brexit and Britain crashes out of the European Union, with what the country’s top civil servant has described as “horrendous consequences”. We have been warned that these could include miles-long queues of lorries at Dover, planes grounded, and the army called in to distribute emergency supplies of food and medicine.In such circumstances, Britain’s rabid tabloids would certainly blame the chaos on the bloody Europeans – especially the French – and demand we immediately stop paying any more money to the EU. The new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, has already said London won’t pay its agreed £39bn orce bill if it doesn’t get a satisfactory deal. Angry Brits will go on to ask: why should our troops be protecting faraway Europeans when the Europeans are screwing us? And then: why not go back to the traditional British policy of trying to ide and rule on the continent?Such a Britain could also arrive more slowly, if the other 27 member states of the EU impose a humiliating orce deal – a milder, peacetime, bureaucratic version of the punitive Versailles treaty imposed on Germany after the first world war, which sowed the seeds of German nationalist revisionism. Britain’s Brexiteers are already talking about a Brexit 2.0, to follow and revise any makeshift deal cobbled together so that Britain can formally exit the EU on 29 March 2019.Am I exaggerating the danger by even hinting at a comparison with Weimar Germany? Indeed I am. I don’t seriously envisage millions of newly unemployed, or a new Hitler coming to power, or a world war started by Boris Johnson. But it’s surely better to overdramatise the risk, to get everyone to wake up to it, rather than do what most of our continental partners have done for the last two years, which is consistently to underestimate the dangers for the whole of Europe that flow from Brexit – especially a mishandled Brexit.And let’s face it, many things have already happened that most people would not have thought possible, even a few years ago. A far-right, nationalist party in Germany gaining as much support in opinion polls as the Social Democrats? Impossible! A xenophobic, lying narcissist as US president, threatening nuclear war on Twitter? Impossible!To avert the danger of a humiliated, ided, angry “Weimar Britain” will require wisdom on both sides of the Channel. On the British side, we need three things traditionally associated with the country but of late in short supply: pragmatic realism, a credible democratic process, and robust civility. With all its faults, Theresa May’s Brexit white paper is a step towards pragmatic realism. All serious people inside government know that Britain will have to compromise some more in order to get a deal with the other 27 member states of the EU.Assuming the EU 27 are also prepared to move, the next step in a credible democratic process is for the British parliament to have its “meaningful vote” on that deal. Realistically, this is likely to be at the very end of this year or early next year. At that point, multiple possibilities unfold, including a fudged Brexit deal securing a narrow parliamentary majority a rejection of the deal followed by a renegotiation a new general election or a second referendum, an idea now supported by several former Conservative cabinet ministers. But sufficient unto the day are the permutations thereof.Right now, the ball is in the EU’s court. Amazingly, the 27 leaders have not had a major strategic discussion of Brexit since spring 2017. Since then, the negotiation has been left to the European commission team led by Michel Barnier, national officials, lawyers and Brussels theologians. They have had good reason to be firm, to protect the interests of Ireland and the integrity of the single market, and not to make Britain’s deal so attractive that other countries will be tempted to “have their cake and eat it”.But I am struck by how some of the best informed, most pro-European British experts, such as Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, have begun to argue that the EU 27 side is being too rigid, too exacting, too punitive in its approach. The exclusion of Britain from the high-security development of the Galileo system (Europe’s alternative to GPS) was a quite gratuitous slap in the face.Yet our European partners could still reasonably say: dear Mrs May, give us a reasonable, detailed explanation of what you want, and we will respond in kind. Well, now she has. Brussels’ initial response has been politely cautious, particularly insisting on clarification of the “backstop” arrangements for keeping an open border on the island of Ireland. But in a notable article, a group of authors including Norbert Röttgen, the chair of the foreign affairs committee of the Bundestag, and Jean Pisani-Ferry, a leading French policy intellectual, have argued that the EU should now stop and think politically, not just bureaucratically, about its response.Is there no compromise at all to be made, for instance, on the issue of labour mobility, if Britain wants to stay in the single market for goods? Beyond such detailed questions, this group is pointing to the need for European leaders to think strategically about how the cross-Channel relationship might look in five to 10 years’ time – which necessarily means thinking about how the EU itself will then look.If Weimar Britain, with all its negative consequences for the rest of Europe, is to be avoided, EU leaders need to have that strategic discussion soon. Countries such as Ireland (which has an existential stake in the UK-EU relationship), Germany and the Netherlands (major and often like-minded economic partners of the UK), and Poland (whose security depends on countries like Britain remaining committed to it), should all be pressing for such a debate. And the European Council president, Donald Tusk, should get it on the agenda of a planned informal meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on 20 September.In preparation, European leaders could read some history during their August break. This must include the familiar 20th-century European story, which gives us those warning bywords Versailles and Weimar, but I’d also recommend a history of the Holy Roman Empire. That earlier European Union lasted so long because it proved capable of adapting to changing circumstances, living with Europe’s ineradicable ersity and complexity, while still maintaining its central purpose and mystique. A lesson, I think, for today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

The massive experience possessed by the Chinese nuclear industry, consistently building for the past 30 years and adopting various next-generation technologies, is being recognised by the global nuclear industry,” said Zaf Coelho, the director of Asia Nuclear Business Platform, based in Singapore.But the depth of CGN’s existing involvement in UK nuclear may surprise some.It was that Chinese ownership of a strategic piece of infrastructure that led Theresa May to temporarily halt the signing of the crucial subsidy deal for Hinkley when she became prime minister.Isabel Hilton, the CEO of Chinadialogue.net, said the UK opening up vital infrastructure to China was without parallel in the western world. “No other OECD country has done this. This is strategic infrastructure, and China is a partner but not an ally in the security sense.“You are making a 50-year bet, not only that there will be no dispute between the UK and China, but also no dispute between China and one of the UK’s allies. It makes no strategic sense.”The UK has appeared amenable to Chinese investment, though recently the UK cybersecurity watchdog warned British telecommunications companies against dealing with Chinese tech firm ZTE. One expert acknowledges that security concerns are a potential check to Chinese ambitions. Zha Daojiong, a professor of non-traditional security studies at Peking University, said: “The question is not whether your nuclear technology is safe or not, it’s a question of politics. To be blunt, most countries think: ‘Anybody but China.’ This kind of thinking is becoming more and more popular among western countries. It’s a serious problem.”While Germany and other western countries have turned their backs on nuclear, the UK is strongly committed to new nuclear to meet its carbon goals and this means, despite security concerns, the government needs Chinese involvement.Robert Davies, the chief operating officer of CGN UK, said: “The UK is open to investment, and we want to invest in clean energy in this country.”He is acutely aware of the need for future plants to be cheaper, given criticism over the cost of the EDF subsidy deal. “We understand the cost of electricity has to fall significantly from Hinkley Point,” he said.But the company is open about the bigger prize – the UK as a springboard for exporting Chinese nuclear technology to other countries. Asked if the UK should be concerned about China owning its nuclear power stations, he said: “We are not surprised and see nothing wrong with governments questioning our rationale for investing in their country.”For now, the company’s UK footprint is small – just 70 of its 44,000 staff are based here. But his hope is the firm will become viewed “not as an outsider that has come in, but part of the furniture”.China’s commitment was on show at a recent lavish nuclear industry event in London. No expense was spared on hosting the summit at the prestigious Guildhall building, where the Chinese ambassador to the UK told jokes and argued the case for new nuclear.Mycle Schneider, a Paris-based nuclear industry analyst, said cost was not an issue for Beijing because the Chinese are playing a long game. “It was clear quite early on there was a strategy to make the UK a platform … A few billion here or there is not the point. It’s about strategic assets.”But he said CGN still had a lot to learn about how the UK worked. “China does not have any building experience in any countries other than Pakistan, and that is not really comparable to the UK.”Zhou Dali, a former Chinese energy official, as director of the energy research institute of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, said: “We are learning how to do business with patience. Because you cannot force others to do something. You can only help. “We will give more and more information about the technology’s improvements, but the final decision will be made by the UK people and your politicians.”Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/763414374ef48fec817a7231291d65acf2e355fc/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1d94450763f17ed5dd818154892b2cd","title":"tommy hilfiger new clothing line monitor customers","story":"Tommy Jeans Xplore items contain a bluetooth chip that will also track customers’ locationClothing stores have long employed all kinds of sneaky behaviour to make you want buy their products. The store assistants tell you you look fantastic in everything, the changing mirrors make you look skinnier, they play music that encourages people to make more purchases. Then often when you get home, those trousers don’t look so good after all, and they stay at the back of your closet forever more.Tommy Jeans, part of the Tommy Hilfiger brand, believe they can solve this part of the problem. Their new line, Tommy Jeans Xplore, will contain smart-chip technology that will track how often customers wear the clothes. Tommy Jeans will offer rewards and experiences, including gig tickets and gift certificates, to people that wear their clothes often enough (presumably some rewards will be even more wear-tracking items).Tommy Jeans says that by tracking users’ clothes-wearing habits they will be creating a “micro-community of brand ambassadors”.The collection includes hoodies, T-shirts, jeans and a denim skirt as well as bags, backpacks and hats. Every item is fitted with a bluetooth chip that can be linked to an Xplore app to start collecting “rewards”. As well as rewards for just wearing the clothes, bonus credits will be awarded for walking past special Tommy Jeans locations, which will be displayed on the app. So you could put the jacket on and then travel across town so that you can tell your jacket you’ve gone to where it told you to go.Tommy Hilfiger representatives said that the data they receive will be encrypted and wearers will be able to turn off the chip’s functionality at any time using the app – so perhaps that will make people feel better about wearing a baseball cap that knows where it is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c165ac89736f41e7bfe29a7f3c307213b6b5bc9/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2c2c0e3fb1241382ab06de24e80e591","title":"suns out legs out 12 of the best shorts for men in pictures","story":"Don’t suffer in jeans during the hot weather – printed or plain, get a pair of new season shorts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/492e93d230d73a2cb9a4e84d9cb52a6ae1a225f3/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026s=66c7021fb46d1fae22f17b0ff08e46ac","title":"luke shaw manchester united jose mourinho","story":"The Manchester United full-back is ready to prove his worth to José Mourinho after a personal pre-season programme in DubaiLuke Shaw is honest regarding the criticism he attracts for perceived weight issues.Speaking at the Montage hotel in Beverly Hills, where Manchester United are based for their US summer tour, Shaw is about to embark on a make-or-break year at Old Trafford. The defender is in great shape physically after a personal pre-season programme in Dubai this month but, more than anything, he would rather his physique was not constantly judged.Shaw, who has started all three of United’s games in the US, is entering the final year of a contract he signed in 2014, when he arrived at Old Trafford from Southampton for a fee in excess of £27m and with the then 18-year-old an England left‑back. He was expected to occupy the same position at United for a decade or more but his career there has yet to fire.Shaw has endured injury, notably a broken leg in September 2015 that ended his season. And from the moment Louis van Gaal, José Mourinho’s predecessor, branded him overweight during the 2014 summer tour of the US, the charge has dogged him.“People can say I’m fat but I know my own body,” Shaw says. “I always look big because I’m bigger built – I’ve got that Wayne Rooney type of body.”The trip to Dubai illustrates the player’s determination to compete with Ashley Young for United’s starting left-back slot, and if a picture he posted on social media is anything to go by the 23-year-old has been doing all the right things.Like Van Gaal before him Mourinho has been critical of Shaw’s weight, leading to accusations of bullying on the Portuguese’s part and the player at one stage last year believing he had no future at United. But as Shaw reveals, the current United manager has been hugely supportive of his summer fitness regime, going as far as to send him encouraging text messages.Shaw runs through his routine in Dubai. “We had to wake up early because it was hitting 45 degrees by 10 o’clock – it was quite painful the first day as we did do it in that heat. I would train and go in the gym. Then relax during the day and run on the beach and do core work in the evening before the sun went down.”Shaw is referencing Mourinho’s public admonishments regarding his approach to training and performances in matches. “It would be easy for me to quit and say: ‘I want to go.’ Of course, if the manager comes and says: ‘You’re not a player for Manchester United, you’re not a player for me,’ then I’ll accept that and find another place.“I want to earn a contract. I don’t want a contract because in the next year I’m a free agent, so they might look to tie me down. I know the club believe me – I’ve spoken with them, the manager, I’ve had discussions, meetings. If they really wanted to they could’ve cashed in. I’m going to fight for it this year and I want to be in that starting team.”“He knows what I can do. That was one of the texts he sent me in the off-season: ‘I know what you can do – you can be the best but you’ve just got to work on a couple of things.’ That’s why it pushes me on more. He says these things because he knows I can do it. He knows I can play for Manchester United."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e0dc19fe434762abb4b65e56e21f3c7f7ff04e6/0_143_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=490a6af7fd1ea9e758111183dae3eb62","title":"davy klaassen ends everton nightmare by joining werder bremen","story":"• Klaassen only made three Premier League starts for Everton• Marco Silva told Dutch midfielder he is not part of his plansWerder Bremen have completed the signing of Davy Klaassen from Everton, the Bundesliga club have announced.Klaassen moved to Goodison Park in a £24m deal from Ajax last June but failed to make an impact there.

But the way Renato Gaúcho greeted Kaiser made Johnson think he was in the presence of someone different. “I even regret not getting up back then. I apologise to Kaiser for that. I’d already met Pelé but I thought the way Kaiser walked was more distinguished. I should have got on my knees, because those legs were incredible!”Kaiser studied the mannerisms, vernacular and attire of every footballer he met. He was like a boffin putting together the ultimate fake footballer – except he was also the boffin’s subject. “Man, he was like a celebrity,” says Maurício. “He’d walk on the tips of his feet looking straight ahead: ‘Hey, buddy. I’m Carlos Kaiser, you have to respect me …’ He had a professional way of talking which was so convincing that people would be scared of him. It was as if he was Pelé or Carlos Alberto Torres.”Kaiser’s celebrity became a self-fulfilling parody. He had other tics, like bending his legs slightly as he walked. The most common was a caress of his mullet, which he would flick forward insouciantly from behind his ears. In the 1980s, the mullet was the twentysomething male’s weapon of choice. Kaiser’s was, by any standards, quite spectacular: a luscious, wavy follicular statement of intent. “His look was his trademark,” says Gutiérrez, one of the few non-footballers in Kaiser’s social circle back then. Somebody else’s trademark, sure, but let’s not split hairs. And Kaiser’s mullet was so majestic that it’s a surprise he didn’t have it insured. Three decades later, he says the favourite item of clothing he has ever owned is his hair. “Life is marketing,” says Kaiser. “I had the air of a star player. I knew how to talk and sell an image. People who saw me thought, ‘The guy’s played in France, he’s been at Flamengo and Fluminense, he’s friends with Bebeto and Carlos Alberto. This guy is the real thing!’ It’s like Lionel Messi and David Beckham. Messi is a great player but the one who sells his image, products and everything is Beckham. Messi doesn’t sell he doesn’t have the right way of talking. Carlos Kaiser does have it. I’ve appeared on several programmes in Brazil and I’m now attracting global attention. I don’t think it was ever to do with my quality as a player or as a lover. It’s because of my charisma.”As the clock moved past 3 am, Renato Gaúcho decided it was probably time to head into the town. The owner of one of Búzios’s main nightclubs had invited him although Renato did not fancy it earlier in the evening, he changed his mind as restlessness and boredom kicked in. He knew the club would not close until most people were getting up for work, and so he wandered over with a couple of friends, cutting through the queue to approach the door. Renato didn’t queue or pay to get into nightclubs, so he was confused when a bouncer stepped across his path.“Can I help?”“The owner invited me along. I’m with a couple of friends. We came to have a look around the club.”“But who are you?”At this point the bouncer’s face displayed an expression of insulted intelligence.“Do you think I look like an idiot?”“You’re not coming in because you can’t fool me.”“Fair enough, you don’t have to know who I am but can you let the owner know I’m here.”“You’re not fooling me and I’m not calling the owner because Renato Gaúcho is already in there. I’m not an idiot.”“Yes. He’s in there now. You might look like him but you’re not coming in.”Renato was both intrigued and affronted and asked if he might be able to see this Renato Gaúcho. After five minutes of negotiation, the bouncer walked him inside and pointed to a table in the VIP section – where Kaiser was holding court with a group of women. Renato smiled knowingly, turned on his heels and left. “What,” he laughs three decades later, “can I do with a guy like that?”Renato was amused rather than annoyed by Kaiser borrowing his identity. “He was my Mini-Me,” he says. “I started hearing all these stories: ‘This guy’s slept with women pretending to be you, he’s doing well out of your name.’ I said, ‘Whatever. If the guy’s doing well, let him. Unless he’s stealing or attacking somebody, let him do well out of it.’ He looked a lot like me. A hell of a lot. I would be at the team hotel the night before a game and people would say I had sneaked out and was with a woman. I had to explain that he was my double. I used to get in trouble at home with my wife. And it wasn’t me. It was Kaiser. And not even that would make me stop being friends with him.”At a time when players were not constantly on television or in newspapers, there were more than enough similarities – height, mullet, physique, mullet, swagger, mullet, sunglasses, mullet – to fool casual football fans, whether they were nightclub bouncers or desirable females. ‘He styled his hair the same as Renato and if someone didn’t know much about football they would fall for it,’ says Alexandre Couto, who played with Kaiser at Ajaccio. ‘He did well: 1-0 to him.’ There are tens, maybe hundreds of women, who will go to their graves convinced they have had sex with Renato Gaúcho. “I used to go out with older women for money,” says Kaiser. “When America or Bangu were playing away from home, there was somebody who arranged it. The women wanted to date Renato but they paid to sleep with Kaiser.”There are stories of an up-and-coming footballer called Renato Kaiser, whose mother – so the legend goes – had a soft spot for both men and christened him accordingly. “That’s the first time I’ve heard that,” chuckles Renato. ‘My technique and skill combined with Kaiser’s sweet talk? Oh my God. I really want to meet this kid. He’s going to be Superman.”Renato was not the only person whose identity Kaiser borrowed. He would claim the achievements of other players with a similar name, showing newspaper cuttings to convince people he was a star. Kaiser had a different mental checklist to most before a night out: keys, wallet, newspaper cuttings. And he usually didn’t need the wallet.In September 1985, a young Grêmio defender called Henrique scored the winning goal for Brazil in the Under-20 World Cup final in the USSR. Kaiser passed that off as his own. Henrique had lighter skin and blond hair, but that didn’t come across in match reports – especially as, with the tournament in the Soviet Union, most newspapers could not afford to send a photographer.He also laminated articles about Henrique, the America striker, and took them around in his bumbag. He didn’t even care whether the reports were heavily critical, just so long as they showed he was a player. “The coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo took Carlos Henrique off for Carlos Alberto to give the attack more movement,” reads one of Kaiser’s cuttings. Another gives him a 410 rating, saying he had “no creativity and no purpose”. Kaiser even managed to make a video of his greatest goals to impress women. He proudly boasted about one goal in particular, a bulldozing solo run by Vasco’s Henrique against Flamengo in 1987. Henrique, like Kaiser, was tall, thin and bemulleted on a grainy video, a non-football fan would never be able to tell them apart. But they would hear the commentary: “GOL DE FANTASTICO! HENRIQUE!”“I only ever saw him play on video,” says Valeria Gallo, an ex-girlfriend of Kaiser’s. “There was a very famous goal against Flamengo when he, how do you say it in football, resolved the game? He scored an amazing goal. Did you not know about that? I still have the video tape he gave me. It’s worth its weight in gold because not even he has it anymore. It was him. I’m almost sure it was.”Kaiser: the Greatest Footballer Never to Play Football is in cinemas from Friday 27 July.

Rene Craighead, 17, ate around four bags of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos and Takis, another spicy snack, every week – until she was hospitalized for stomach pains. Her doctor reportedly told her that snacking habits were the reason she is now missing a gallbladder.Craighead’s mother now wants to warn other spicy chip fans of the potential dangers they face. “When my daughter had to have this surgery, I knew I had to tell everybody about it,” she told WREG, a local Memphis TV station.You can live relatively normally without a gallbladder, but it can be harder to digest food.Frito-Lay and Takis have released statements claiming their snacks are safe, but should be enjoyed in moderation.This isn’t the first time that Hot Cheetos and Takis have fired up debate. In 2012, a number of schools across California, New Mexico and Illinois banned the spicy snacks. The main reason cited was the lack of nutritional value, but another concern was the messiness. One middle school teacher complained students were leaving a trail of sticky red fingerprints everywhere they went. In the past decade, hot chips have become something of a hot property in school. Such is their popularity that a 2012 music video called Hot Cheetos \u0026amp Takis, produced by children in Minnesota, has racked up more than 16m views. Hot Cheetos were invented by Richard Montañez, the son of migrant farm workers, while working as a janitor at a Frito-Lay factory in California. According to Montañez, his Eureka moment came when a technical malfunction caused a batch of Cheetos to go un-powdered. According to a 2016 interview with Inc, Montañez thought, “What if I add chili to a Cheeto?” The rest is history.Earlier this year it was announced that a feature film is being made about Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, celebrating its origin story. Fox Searchlight won the rights to the project, in beating off competition from multiple studios who wanted to produce the film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03da352ce94579a4e19417adffa01a82bc28ada5/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43ba78af187c694cdc6c15dd2a5d9b10","title":"ban fat shaming show insatiable netflix its critics cry but none of them have seen it","story":"Like Beverley Hughes railing against Brass Eye, those who pelt round the hamster wheels of social media outrage have – yet again – confused the subject of a joke with its targetAt what point do the outrage police become the outrage Stasi? Or at what point did they? For a measure of how far we haven’t come since the turn of the millennium, compare the cases of the Brass Eye episode entitled Paedogeddon and a forthcoming Netflix show called Insatiable.In 2001, Channel 4 announced it would air a one-off special of the Chris Morris show, which would satirise the kneejerk populism and hysteria around the coverage of paedophilia. The outrage was predictably swift, as people fell into the old trap of confusing the subject of the joke with the target of the joke. Leading the protests was Beverley Hughes, a junior Home Office minister in Tony Blair’s government, who began by calling the programme “unspeakably sick” and worked up from there. The affair became quite the governmental pile-on, with seemingly every minister keen to find a microphone or TV camera into which to unleash their outraged take on it all. On behalf of the prime minister himself, a Downing Street spokesman wondered pointedly whether the UK’s regulatory framework was sufficient to cope with such a thing.Quite a few days into her crusade, Hughes managed to land a spot on the Today programme. All was proceeding as might have been expected, until the minister committed a spectacular unforced error – she admitted she hadn’t actually seen the show. “To be honest, I don’t really want to,” Hughes continued, adding helpfully that the equally irate home secretary hadn’t seen it either, “of course”.OF COURSE. It was too perfect, doing almost as much to satirise what Morris was chipping away at as the show itself. Not everyone shared this view, of course – plenty remained furious about wholly and often deliberately inaccurate summaries of something they also hadn’t seen. At some level, that’s the way of things. Hysterics gonna hysteric.But, for many of us, the Hughes admission was so exquisitely hilarious because it felt like it represented one of the last howls of a dying era – a sort of silly, self-parodic throwback to the heyday of Mary Whitehouse and all the other frothing censors who were largely untrammelled by even a distant acquaintance with what the hell they were frothing about. Or to put it another way: wildly overpromoted junior ministers in the Blair Home Office WERE the joke – and it felt as though progressives got that.Once again, my optimism turns out to have been preposterously, cosmically misplaced. We are all wildly overpromoted junior ministers in the Blair Home Office now. Or, rather, those who pelt furiously round the hamster wheels of social media outrage are.And so to Insatiable, a Netflix comedy-drama that has yet to air, but is already the subject of a petition calling for it to be banned. A single one-minute-52-second trailer has been released, from which it can be inferred that the story concerns an overweight girl who is the victim of bullying. Owing to a plot device, she has to have her jaw wired shut during a summer holiday. The side-effect of this is that she loses weight. She returns to school looking like the classic high school princess – and hellbent on bloody revenge. From the looks of the trailer, chaos ensues. As one might expect in a comedy-drama.At the time of writing (although the number is climbing fast), almost 170,000 signatories are demanding Insatiable never be aired, on the basis that it is “fat-shaming”. When I read this, my naive assumption was that the entire series must have leaked online, giving a complete overview of the story arcs, nuances and so on. But no – people who really do imagine themselves to be progressives really are calling for a creative work to be banned on the basis of a trailer. All manner of furious commentators weighed in, railing against what they think it is about, producing some fantastically witless statements, including a widely quoted one from someone who explained “physical violence is not an OK response to bullying”. Good point! Also, murder is terrible. There should be no shows about it.Well, quite. From what I have seen – to repeat, a mere 1 minute and 52 seconds – Insatiable does not remotely condone fat-shaming any more than Morris’s show condoned paedophilia (something plenty accused it of). The subject of the joke has once again been confused with the target. It is clear the accidental weight loss precipitates a classic upending of the order, a hierarchy-busting plot device in which exciting and perhaps amusing dramatic conflict can flourish. I mean, honestly. Chaos, often questionably achieved, has been an intrinsic part of drama since for ever. You might as well try to ban A Midsummer Night’s Dream on the basis that its plot glorifies date-rape drugs.As for where this latest outrage fits in to your week in outrage, it is difficult to keep track. I first heard about this row just after the defenestration of s of the Galaxy creator James Gunn, which was orchestrated by Mike Cernovich, an “alt-right” goon and “men’s rights” wingnut whose chief claim to fame is having spread the lie that Hillary Clinton had something to do with a paedophile ring being operated out of the basement of a Washington pizzeria. So, yes, I heard about the Insatiable thing after the James Gunn thing, and just before the attempted defenestration of Community and Rick and Morty creator Dan Harman for a paedophilia sketch. Cernovich is in the vanguard of that one, too.This is the way we live now, on left and right – but cui bono? If you haven’t read Jaron Lanier’s short but brilliant book Ten Arguments For Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now, I can only recommend. For technological idiots like me, who need the machine explained to them in a wonderfully eloquent and engaging fashion, it is a true mind-opener. Using evidence and his vast insider knowledge of Silicon Valley, the author and tech visionary makes it very clear that, far from toiling in the furtherances of whichever noble cause they think they are, those who feed the internet outrage machine are under an illusion.They are nothing more than busy data ants, who in reality – BIG REVEAL – work for the likes of Facebook and Google. These are mass-behaviour-modification machines that thrive off discord and – without wishing to downgrade anyone’s genuinely impassioned and sincerely held beliefs – it really doesn’t matter what sort. Everyone’s participation, on whichever side, hastens the dystopia. Your causes, my causes, everyone’s causes are essentially meaningless – they are plot devices. And the plot is the mass, unprecedented manipulation of human behaviour and its subsequent exploitation for money. Everyone works for the machine, which doesn’t think that fat-shaming matters, or paedophilia matters, or black lives matter, or you matter. For a honeymoon period, it may feel as if that is a price worth paying if you are furthering a cause in which you believe – but, as Lanier shows, this always turns out to be a mirage.Back when the Brass Eye furore was raging, Christopher Howse lamented that people couldn’t tell satire from voyeurism. From the looks of the Insatiable trailer, an awful lot of people can’t tell satire from fat-shaming. Maybe the show itself will get it wrong – but you simply can’t tell until you’ve seen it. That should be a basic principle for anyone, let alone people who wish to think of themselves as progressive. Instead, they are indulging in another form of kneejerk populism, which happens to emanate from people who imagine themselves as “the good guys”, but could just as easily be one of the plays of the “alt-right”.Still, on it goes. Ban it pre-emptively destroy it don’t begin to attempt to understand it. One sadness is that we’ve yet to hear from Hughes on Insatiable. She is currently Manchester’s deputy mayor for policing and crime. We must hope she can be persuaded into a trenchant comment article in the coming days, as historical farce increasingly repeats itself as tragedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c64a371b5532a9abd10532baaa73132dfea1bfe/0_233_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2acbae2cc4f6ae66668d86bb2fc1c2ee","title":"scroll free september weaning off social media health","story":"Take back control, urges public health body, as it encourages people to abstain or cut downWe’ve got Dry January for anyone tempted to try alcohol abstinence and Stoptober for smokers who want to quit. Now, Scroll Free September will target the use of social media.The Royal Society for Public Health, which is behind the campaign, is urging everyone to stop using – or reduce use of – Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and other social media platforms for the month.The campaign is being billed as an “opportunity to take back control of our relationship with social media” for the millions of Britons for whom social media plays a large, possibly unhealthily large, role in their lives. Anyone accepting the challenge can either go cold turkey, abstaining completely for a month, or commit to reduce their use, for example by steering clear of social media at social events or in the evening. Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, said: “The aim is that by the end of the month we will be able to reflect back on what we missed and what we got to enjoy instead of scrolling through our newsfeeds.” But, she added: “Of course we know this will be a challenge because of the addictive nature of social media technology.” Chris Elmore, chair of an all-party group of MPs and peers looking at the impact of social media on young people’s mental health, said: “Many of us are becoming consumed by social media and whilst there are many benefits to using the various platforms available, it’s important to take some time out.” Mark Winstanley, the chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said people should limit, rather than abandon, their use of social media. “Social media, like fire, can be a great servant but a deadly master,” he said. “There’s plenty of evidence that shows that those affected by mental illness can get support and guidance through social media but at the same time it can prove addictive and affect some people’s wellbeing.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b94abc75407ba6508028c6fbc55b88aa682d0791/0_250_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b12eac68179d7a5451f43e9e5394bd28","title":"household debt in uk worse than at any time on record","story":"British household finances among most indebted in major western countries, ONS saysBritish households spent around £900 more on average than they received in income during 2017, pushing their finances into deficit for the first time since the credit boom of the 1980s. The Office for National Statistics said the shortfall amounted to nearly £25bn – equal to almost a quarter of the NHS budget – and the overspend was mostly paid for with borrowed money, though households also ran down savings.The figures pose a challenge to the government, which was warned last year that Britain’s consumer credit bubble of more than £200bn was unsustainable. A dramatic rise in debt-fuelled spending since 2016 has also taken place against the backdrop of the Brexit vote, which triggered a rise in inflation at a time of weak wage growth.Analysts warned that a squeeze on household incomes from benefit cuts, lacklustre wages and high inflation would continue to force poorer households to borrow more to pay basic bills.Tom Selby, a research analyst at financial adviser AJ Bell, said the figures presented ministers with a significant challenge as they sought “to build financial resilience in the UK”.Researchers at the ONS said the situation was worse than at any time on record after the £25bn deficit last year surpassed the £300m deficit recorded in 1988. British household finances also slumped from being among the most solvent in the 1990s to being among the most indebted compared with households in other major western countries.Last year official data showed unsecured credit – such as credit cards and payday loans – climbed to a record high of more than £205bn while the consultancy PwC said its own measure showed consumer debts rising above £300bn.The ONS said households took out nearly £80bn in loans in 2017, the most in a decade. But they deposited just £37bn with UK banks, the least since 2011. Households accumulated more debt than they acquired in assets even when their investments in bonds, shares and pensions were included.Anti-poverty charities warned that millions of low income households were the worst affected. StepChange, which provides advice for indebted households, said the poorest were in constant need of credit to keep their heads above water.The charity’s chief executive, Phil Andrew, criticised the ONS for saying that households were living beyond their means, which he said implied they could cut back if they wanted to. “It’s really unfortunate that this very useful data is so heavily sprinkled with the phrase that households are ‘living beyond their means’. The reality is that too many households, here in Britain, in 2018, simply cannot make ends meet, however hard they try.”He added: “Not having enough money to make ends meet is not the same thing as living beyond your means – which implies you have a choice, when too many people do not.”The ONS said a rise in interest rates, expected to be pushed through by the Bank of England next week, could encourage greater saving and an improvement in household finances.But AJ Bell’s Selby said: “For people having to borrow to make ends meet, saving for the future might feel like a luxury they simply cannot afford.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/187b63a808a7d1ed085e7ac57bd405f1d06d0335/0_21_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ba69feb185ae815ae1916d4c9a77c0","title":"english language global dominance","story":"No language in history has dominated the world quite like English does today. Is there any point in resisting? By  Jacob MikanowskiOn 16 May, a lawyer named Aaron Schlossberg was in a New York cafe when he heard several members of staff speaking Spanish. He reacted with immediate fury, threatening to call US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and telling one employee: “Your staff is speaking Spanish to customers when they should be speaking English … This is America.” A video of the incident quickly went viral, drawing widespread scorn. The Yelp page for his law firm was flooded with one-star reviews, and Schlossberg was soon confronted with a “fiesta” protest in front of his Manhattan apartment building, which included a crowd-funded taco truck and mariachi band to serenade him on the way to work.As the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on migrants, speaking any language besides English has taken on a certain charge. In some cases, it can even be dangerous. But if something has changed around the politics of English since Donald Trump took office, the anger Schlossberg voiced taps into deeper nativist roots. Elevating English while denigrating all other languages has been a pillar of English and American nationalism for well over a hundred years. It’s a strain of linguistic exclusionism heard in Theodore Roosevelt’s 1919 address to the American Defense Society, in which he proclaimed that “we have room for but one language here, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boardinghouse”.As it turned out, Roosevelt had things almost perfectly backwards. A century of immigration has done little to dislodge the status of English in North America. If anything, its position is stronger than it was a hundred years ago. Yet from a global perspective, it is not America that is threatened by foreign languages. It is the world that is threatened by English.Behemoth, bully, loudmouth, thief: English is everywhere, and everywhere, English dominates. From inauspicious beginnings on the edge of a minor European archipelago, it has grown to vast size and astonishing influence. Almost 400m people speak it as their first language a billion more know it as a secondary tongue. It is an official language in at least 59 countries, the unofficial lingua franca of dozens more. No language in history has been used by so many people or ned a greater portion of the globe. It is aspirational: the golden ticket to the worlds of education and international commerce, a parent’s dream and a student’s misery, winnower of the haves from the have-nots. It is inescapable: the language of global business, the internet, science, diplomacy, stellar navigation, avian pathology. And everywhere it goes, it leaves behind a trail of dead: dialects crushed, languages forgotten, literatures mangled.One straightforward way to trace the growing influence of English is in the way its vocabulary has infiltrated so many other languages. For a millennium or more, English was a great importer of words, absorbing vocabulary from Latin, Greek, French, Hindi, Nahuatl and many others. During the 20th century, though, as the US became the dominant superpower and the world grew more connected, English became a net exporter of words. In 2001, Manfred Görlach, a German scholar who studies the dizzying number of regional variants of English – he is the author of the collections Englishes, More Englishes, Still More Englishes, and Even More Englishes – published the Dictionary of European Anglicisms, which gathers together English terms found in 16 European languages. A few of the most prevalent include “last-minute”, “fitness”, “group sex”, and a number of terms related to seagoing and train travel.In some countries, such as France and Israel, special linguistic commissions have been working for decades to stem the English tide by creating new coinages of their own – to little avail, for the most part. (As the journalist Lauren Collins has wryly noted: “Does anyone really think that French teenagers, per the academy’s diktat, are going to trade out ‘sexting’ for texto pornographique?”) Thanks to the internet, the spread of English has almost certainly sped up.The gravitational pull that English now exerts on other languages can also be seen in the world of fiction. The writer and translator Tim Parks has argued that European novels are increasingly being written in a kind of denatured, international vernacular, shorn of country-specific references and difficult-to-translate wordplay or grammar. Novels in this mode – whether written in Dutch, Italian or Swiss German – have not only assimilated the style of English, but perhaps more insidiously limit themselves to describing subjects in a way that would be easily digestible in an anglophone context.Yet the influence of English now goes beyond simple lexical borrowing or literary influence. Researchers at the IULM University in Milan have noticed that, in the past 50 years, Italian syntax has shifted towards patterns that mimic English models, for instance in the use of possessives instead of reflexives to indicate body parts and the frequency with which adjectives are placed before nouns. German is also increasingly adopting English grammatical forms, while in Swedish its influence has been changing the rules governing word formation and phonology.Within the anglophone world, that English should be the key to all the world’s knowledge and all the world’s places is rarely questioned. The hegemony of English is so natural as to be invisible. Protesting it feels like yelling at the moon. Outside the anglophone world, living with English is like drifting into the proximity of a supermassive black hole, whose gravity warps everything in its reach. Every day English spreads, the world becomes a little more homogenous and a little more bland.Until recently, the story of English was broadly similar to that of other global languages: it spread through a combination of conquest, trade and colonisation. (Some languages, such as Arabic and Sanskrit, also caught on through their status as sacred tongues.) But then, at some point between the end of the second world war and the start of the new millenium, English made a jump in primacy that no amount of talk about it as a “lingua franca” or “global language” truly captures. It transformed from a dominant language to what the Dutch sociologist Abram de Swaan calls a “hypercentral” one.Following these are the 12 “supercentral languages”: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Malay, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and Swahili – each of which (except for Swahili) boast 100 million speakers or more. These are languages you can travel with. They connect people across nations. They are commonly spoken as second languages, often (but not exclusively) as a result of their parent nation’s colonial past.Then, finally, we come to the top of the pyramid, to the languages that connect the supercentral ones. There is only one: English, which De Swaan calls “the hypercentral language that holds the entire world language system together”. The Japanese novelist Minae Mizumura similarly describes English as a “universal language” . For Mizumura, what makes it universal is not that it has many native speakers – Mandarin and Spanish have more – but that it is “used by the greatest number of non-native speakers in the world”. She compares it to a currency used by more and more people until its utility hits a critical mass and it becomes a world currency. The literary critic Jonathan Arac is even more blunt, noting, in a critique of what he calls “Anglo-Globalism”, that “English in culture, like the dollar in economics, serves as the medium through which knowledge may be translated from the local to the global.”In the last few decades, as globalisation has accelerated and the US has remained the world’s most powerful country, the advance of English has taken on a new momentum. In 2008, Rwanda switched its education system from French to English, having already made English an official language in 14 years earlier. Officially, this was part of the government’s effort to make Rwanda the tech hub of Africa. Unofficially, it’s widely believed to be an expression of disgust at France’s role in propping-up the pre-1994 Hutu-dominant government, as well as a reflection that the country’s ruling elite mostly speaks English, having grown up as exiles in anglophone east Africa. When South Sudan became independent in 2011, it made English its official language despite having very few resources or qualified personnel with which to teach it in schools. The Minister of higher education at the time justified the move as being aimed at making the country “different and modern”, while the news director of South Sudan Radio added that with English, South Sudan could “become one nation” and “communicate with the rest of the world” – understandable goals in a country home to more than 50 local languages.The situation in east Asia is no less dramatic. China currently has more speakers of English as a second language than any other country. Some prominent English teachers have become celebrities, conducting mass lessons in stadiums seating thousands. In South Korea, meanwhile, according to the sociolinguist Joseph Sung-Yul Park, English is a “national religion”. Korean employers expect proficiency in English, even in positions where it offers no obvious advantage.The quest to master English in Korea is often called the yeongeo yeolpung or “English frenzy”. Although mostly confined to a mania for instruction and immersion, occasionally this “frenzy” spills over into medical intervention. As Sung-Yul Park relates: “An increasing number of parents in South Korea have their children undergo a form of surgery that snips off a thin band of tissue under the tongue … Most parents pay for this surgery because they believe it will make their children speak English better the surgery supposedly enables the child to pronounce the English retroflex consonant with ease, a sound that is considered to be particularly difficult for Koreans.”There is no evidence to suggest that this surgery in any way improves English pronunciation. The willingness to engage in this useless surgical procedure strikes me, though, as a potent metaphor for English’s peculiar status in the modern world. It is no longer simply a tool suited to a particular task or set of tasks, as it was in the days of the Royal Navy or the International Commission for Air Navigation. It is now seen as the access code to the global elite. If you want your children to get ahead, then they better have English in their toolkit.Is the conquest of English really so bad? In the not-too-distant future, thanks to English, the curse of Babel will be undone and the children of men may come together once again, united with the aid of a common tongue. Certainly, that’s what English’s boosters would have you believe. After all, what a work is English, how copious in its vocabulary, how noble in expression, how sinuous in its constructions, and yet how plain in its basic principles. A language, in short, with a word for almost everything, capable of an infinite gradation of meanings, equally suited to describing the essential rights of mankind as to ornamenting a packet of crisps, whose only defect, as far as I know, is that it makes everyone who speaks it sound like a duck.Well, not really. (OK, maybe a little – English, while not an ugly language, isn’t exactly pretty either). Mostly, I’m speaking out of bitterness – one that is old, and until recently, lay dormant. My first language was Polish. I learned it from my parents at home. English followed shortly, at school in Pennsylvania. I learned to speak it fluently, but with an accent, which took years of teasing – and some speech therapy, kindly provided by the state – to wear away. That, combined with the experience of watching the widespread condescension towards those who take their time learning English, left me a lifelong English-sceptic. (I admit, also, that a strain of linguistic megalomania runs through many Polish speakers, one best summed up by the novelist Joseph Conrad, who, when asked why he didn’t write in his native language, replied: “I value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle. But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient.”)It’s not that English is bad. It’s fine! A perfectly nice language, capable of expressing a great many things – and with scores of fascinating regional variants, from Scots to Singapore English. But it is so prevalent. And so hard to escape. And so freighted with buffoonish puffery written on its behalf: “our magnificent bastard tongue” “the language that connects the world”. Please. There is no reason for any particular language to be worshipped around the world like a golden idol. There is a pervasive mismatch between the grand claims made on English’s behalf, and its limitations as means of communication (limitations, to be fair, that it shares with all other languages).Is English oppressive? When its pervasive influence silences other languages, or discourages parents from passing on their native languages to their children, I think it can be. When you do know another language, it’s merely constricting, like wearing trousers that are too tight. That’s because while English is good for a great many things, it is not good for everything. To me, family intimacies long to be expressed in Polish. So does anything concerning the seasons, forest products and catastrophic sorrows. Poetry naturally sounds better in Polish. I’ve always spoken it to cats and dogs on the assumption that they understand, being simultaneously convinced that raccoons and lesser animals only respond to shouts.This isn’t quite as idiosyncratic as it sounds. Aneta Pavlenko, an applied linguist at Temple University in Pennsylvania, who has spent her career studying the psychology of bilingual and multilingual speakers, has found that speakers of multiple languages frequently believe that each language conveys a “different self”. Languages, according to her respondents, come in a kaleidoscopic range of emotional tones. “I would inevitably talk to babies and animals in Welsh,” reports a Welsh-speaker. An informant from Finland counters: “Finnish emotions are rarely stated explicitly. Therefore it is easier to tell my children that I love them in English.” Several Japanese speakers say that it’s easier to express anger in English, especially by swearing.Intuitive though it might be to some, the idea that different languages capture and construct different realities has been a subject of academic controversy for at least 200 years. The German explorer Alexander von Humboldt was among the first to articulate it in a complex form. After studying Amerindian languages in the New World, he came to the conclusion that every language “draws a circle” around its speakers, creating a distinct worldview through its grammar as well as in its vocabulary. In the 20th century, the American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf elaborated this idea into a broader vision of how language structures thought. Both drew inspiration for their work from their study of North American languages such as Nootka, Shawnee and Hopi.This idea – now usually known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis, or Sapir-Whorf hypothesis – has had a checkered history in academia. At different times, it has been hailed by it proponents as foundational insight for modern anthropology and literary theory, and blamed by its detractors as the source of the worst excesses of postmodern philosophy. In recent decades, sociolinguists have arrived at a few startlingly suggestive findings concerning the influence of language on colour perception, orientation and verbs of motion – but in general, the more expansive notion that different languages inculcate fundamentally different ways of thinking has not been proven.Nonetheless, some version of this idea continues to find supporters, not least among writers familiar with shifting between languages. Here is the memoirist Eva Hoffman on the experience of learning English in Vancouver while simultaneously feeling cut off from the Polish she had grown up speaking as a teenager in Kraków: “This radical disjointing between word and thing is a desiccating alchemy, draining the world not only of significance but of its colours, striations, nuances – its very existence. It is the loss of a living connection.” The Chinese writer Xiaolu Guo described something similar in her recent memoir, writing about how uncomfortable she felt, at first, with the way the English language encouraged speakers to use the first-person singular, rather than plural. “After all, how could someone who had grown up in a collective society get used to using the first-person singular all the time? … But here, in this foreign country, I had to build a world as a first-person singular – urgently.”In the 1970s, Anna Wierzbicka, a linguist who found herself marooned in Australia after a long career in Polish academia, stood the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis on its head. Instead of trying to describe the worldviews of distant hunter-gatherers, she turned her sociolinguistic lens on the surrounding anglophones. For Wierzbicka, English shapes its speakers as powerfully as any other language. It’s just that in an anglophone world, that invisible baggage is harder to discern. In a series of books culminating in 2013’s evocatively named Imprisoned in English, she has attempted to analyse various assumptions – social, spatial, emotional and otherwise – latent in English spoken by the middle and upper classes in the US and UK.Reading Wierzbicka’s work is like peeking through a magic mirror that inverts the old “how natives think” school of anthropology and turns it back on ourselves. Her English-speakers are a pragmatic people, cautious in their pronouncements and prone to downplaying their emotions. They endlessly qualify their remarks according to their stance towards what is being said. Hence their endless use of expressions such as “I think”, “I believe”, “I suppose”, “I understand”, “I suspect”. They prefer fact over theories, savour “control” and “space”, and cherish autonomy over intimacy. Their moral lives are governed by a tightly interwoven knot of culture-specific concepts called “right” and “wrong”, which they mysteriously believe to be universal.Wierzbicka’s description of English’s subconscious system of values hardly holds true for the billion or more speakers of this most global of tongues. But it is also a reminder that, despite its influence, English is not truly universal. Its horizons are just as limited as those of any other language, whether Chinese or Hopi or Dalabon.For if language connects people socially, it also connects them to a place. The linguist Nicholas Evans has described how Kayardild, a language spoken in northern Australia, requires a speaker to continually orient themselves according to the cardinal directions. Where an English speaker would orient things according to their own perception – my left, my right, my front, my back – a speaker of Kayardild thinks in terms of north, south, east and west. As a consequence, speakers of Kayardild (and those of several other languages that share this feature) possess “absolute reckoning”, or a kind of “perfect pitch” for direction. It also means removing one’s self as the main reference point for thinking about space. As Evans writes of his own experiences learning the language, “one aspect of speaking Kayardild, then, is learning that the landscape is more important and objective than you are. Kayardild grammar literally puts everyone in their place.”Kayardild and its kin are truly local languages, with few speakers, and modes of expression that are hard to separate from the places in which they are spoken. But that should not lead us to think that they are lesser. The world is made up of places, not universals. To speak only English, in spite of its vast vocabulary and countless varieties, is still to dwell in a rather small pool. It draws the same circle Humboldt described around its speakers as each of the other 6,000 human languages. The difference is that we have mistaken that circle for the world.Because English is increasingly the currency of the universal, it is difficult to express any opposition to its hegemony that doesn’t appear to be tainted by either nationalism or snobbery. When Minae Mizumura published the Fall of Language in the Age of English, in 2008, it was a surprise commercial success in Japan. But it provoked a storm of criticism, as Mizumura was accused of elitism, nationalism and being a “hopeless reactionary”. One representative online comment read: “Who does she think she is, a privileged bilingual preaching to the rest of us Japanese!” (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mizumura’s broader argument, about the gradual erosion of Japanese literature – and especially, the legacy of the Japanese modernist novel – got lost in the scuffle.)Those of us troubled by the hyperdominance of English should also remember the role it has played in some societies – especially multi-ethnic ones – as a bridge to the wider world and counterweight to other nationalisms. This was especially keenly felt in South Africa, where Afrikaans was widely associated with the policy of apartheid. When the government announced that Afrikaans would be used as a language of instruction in schools on par with English in 1974, the decision led in 1976 to a mass demonstration by black students known as the Soweto uprising. Its brutal suppression resulted in hundreds of deaths, and is considered a turning point in the anti-apartheid struggle. Similar protests have periodically racked southern India since the 1940s over attempts to enforce official use of Hindi in place of English.In other parts of the world though, English still carries the full weight of its colonialist past. Since the 1960s, the celebrated Kenyan novelist Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o has advocated on behalf of African languages and against the prevalence of English-language education in postcolonial countries. In his landmark 1986 book Decolonising the Mind: the Politics of Language in African Literature, he describes the corrosive effect of English language instruction, comparing it to a form of “spiritual subjugation”. Colonial education, in which pupils were physically punished for speaking their native languages while at school (something also done to the Welsh into the early 20th century) was necessarily, and deliberately, alienating, “like separating the mind from the body”.Since publishing Decolonising the Mind, Ngũgĩ has worked to put its dictates into practice. He renounced his baptismal name, James, and with it Christianity, and ceased to write fiction in English. Since the 1980s, he has written all his novels and plays in his native Gikuyu, only using English (and occasionally Kiswahili) for essays and polemics. This last decision is one that many people still question. As he said in a recent interview: “If I meet an English person, and he says, ‘I write in English,’ I don’t ask him, ‘Why are you writing in English?’ If I meet a French writer, I don’t ask him, ‘Why don’t you write in Vietnamese?’ But I am asked over and over again, ‘Why do you write in Gikuyu?’ For Africans, the view is there is something wrong about writing in an African language.”Part of the paradox of Ngũgĩ’s situation is that while he may be the world’s foremost advocate for writing literature in African languages, his novels have won acclaim and gained international recognition through the medium of English. The hegemony of English is now such that, in order to be recognised, any opposition to English has to formulated in English in order to be heard.In most of the world, it’s already too late. In California, where I live, most of the languages that were spoken before the arrival of Europeans are already extinct. On America’s eastern seaboard, thanks to long proximity to Anglo settlers, the situation is even worse. Most of what we know about many of these vanished languages comes in the form of brief word lists compiled by European settlers and traders before the 19th century. Stadaconan (or Laurentian) survives only from a glossary of 220 words jotted down by Jacques Cartier when he sailed up the St Lawrence River in Canada in 1535. Eastern Atakapa, from Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, is known from a list of only 287, gathered in 1802. The last fragments of Nansemond, once spoken in eastern Virginia, were collected from the last living speaker just before his death in 1902, by which time he could only recall six words: one, two, three, four, five and dog.The great Malian historian and novelist Amadou Hampâté Bâ once said that in Africa, when an elder dies, a library burns. Today, across the world, the libraries are still burning. In his marvellous book, Searching for Aboriginal Languages: Memoirs of a Field Worker, the linguist Robert MW Dixon describes travelling across Northern Queensland in the 1960s and 70s to record indigenous languages, many of which had already dwindled to a handful of speakers. It’s hard to remain an oral language in an increasingly text-dependent world. All the forces of modernity, globalisation, industrialisation, urbanisation and the rise of the nation-state are arrayed against the small and local as opposed to the big and shareable.In this past century, the Earth has been steadily losing ersity at every level of biology and culture. Few deny this is a bad thing. Too often though, we forget that these crises of ersity depend, to a great extent, on our own decisions. Much of what has been done can also be undone, provided there is the will for it. Hebrew is the most famous case of a language brought back from the dead, but linguistic revitalisation has been proven to be possible elsewhere as well. Czech became a viable national language thanks to the work of literary activists in the 19th century. On a much smaller scale, endangered languages such as Manx in the Isle of Man and Wampanoag in the US have been successfully pulled back from the brink.Coming face-to-face with the current onslaught of linguicide, I find myself wanting to venture a modest proposal. What if anglo-globalism wasn’t a one-way street? What if the pre-contact languages of the Americas were taught in American high schools? What if British schoolchildren learned some of the languages spoken by the actual residents of the former empire? (This is a utopian project obviously. But how much would it actually cost to add a linguistic elective to larger high schools? One jet fighter? A few cruise missiles?)Current educational discourse is full of talk about the need to bolster children’s cognition. In the culture at large, experts have been trumpeting the cognitive benefits of everything from online brain games to magic mushrooms. Why not try Hopi instead? The point of this education wouldn’t necessarily be to acquire fluency in an extinct or smaller language – it would be to open a door.And think of the vistas it might open up. For generations, a huge percentage of philosophy and social science has been conducted in and about English speakers. Humankind, as imagined by the academy, is mostly anglophone. This has even been true in linguistics. Noam Chomsky’s idea of a universal grammar underpinning all languages was based on a rather narrow empirical base. More recent research into dozens of smaller languages, like Kayardild and Pirahã, has been steadily whittling away at his list of supposed universals. We now know there are languages without adverbs, adjectives, prepositions and articles. There seems to be hardly anything that a language “needs” to be – just thousands of natural experiments in how they might be assembled. And most of them are about to be lost.In some ways, the worst threat may come not from the global onrush of modernity, but from an idea: that a single language should suit every purpose, and that being monolingual is therefore somehow “normal”. This is something that’s often assumed reflexively by those of us who live most of our lives in English, but historically speaking, monolingualism is something of an aberration.Before the era of the nation-state, polyglot empires were the rule, rather than the exception. Polyglot iniduals abounded, too. For most of history, people lived in small communities. But that did not mean that they were isolated from one another. Multilingualism must have been common. Today, we see traces of this polyglot past in linguistic hotspots such as the Mandara mountains of Cameroon, where children as young as 10 routinely juggle four or five languages in daily life, and learn several others in school.Residents of Arnhem Land in northern Australia routinely speak half a dozen or more languages by the time they are adults. Multilingualism, writes Nicholas Evans, “is helped by the fact that you have to marry outside your clan, which likely means your wife or husband speaks a different language from you. It also means that you parents each speak a different language, and your grandparents three or four languages between them.”A resident of another linguistic hotspot, the Sepik region of Papua New Guinea, once told Evans: “It wouldn’t be any good if we talked the same we like to know where people come from.” It’s a vision of Babel in reverse. Instead of representing a fall from human perfection, as in the biblical story, having many languages is a gift. It’s something to remember before we let English swallow the globe.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e067f63b1c2e8d72bdb8e8ba76a7954e7980584/0_311_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a346e3d29dc4e019eec49977e54b8a3c","title":"michel barnier tears up theresa mays brexit customs proposals","story":"EU’s chief Brexit negotiator says UK ministers’ attempts to appeal to inidual leaders are ‘waste of time’Michel Barnier has warned that attempts to appeal to EU leaders over his head were a waste of time as he rejected Theresa May’s proposals on customs after Brexit, in effect killing off the Chequers plan.On Friday Theresa May travels to Austria to meet Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and the Czech prime minister Andrej Babis, before heading off on her summer holiday.May’s trip follows the EU chief Brexit negotiator insisting there was no difference of opinion in European capitals to exploit.“Anyone who wants to find a sliver of difference between my mandate and what the heads of government say they want are wasting their time, quite frankly,” he told reporters at a joint press conference with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, in Brussels.The British negotiators have become increasingly frustrated with the EU’s attitude to the white paper thrashed out at the prime minister’s country retreat. They feel that it will take an intervention by leaders, most likely at a summit in Salzburg in September, to move the dial in favour of a deal. A number of cabinet ministers have been despatched around EU capitals to make their case for greater flexibility.The impasse in the negotiations was laid bare in the press conference in the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters as a thunderstorm broke outside.While Raab insisted that with “political will” a deal on trade and on avoiding a border on the island of Ireland was achievable by a crunch summit in October, Barnier offered a damning verdict on a major element of the UK’s vision of the future.To avoid customs checks after Brexit, the government wants an unprecedented system where the UK would collect EU duties while having the freedom to set different tariffs on goods destined for the British market.The plan would allow the UK to make its own free trade deals around the world, while not losing the benefits of frictionless trade to and from the rest of Europe.But echoing the language of Theresa May on her goals for Brexit, Barnier responded: “Maintaining control of our money, law and borders also applies to the EU customs policy. The EU cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures.“Any customs arrangements or customs union – and I have always said that the EU is open to a customs union – must respect this principle.”Moments earlier, Barnier had struck a warmer note by saying he was “particularly pleased” with the progress of talks on foreign policy and security. But he added: “On our future economic relationship, it comes as no surprise that finding common ground between the EU27 and the UK is more difficult.” Raab, in his second appearance in Brussels since he replaced David Davis in the cabinet, claimed in response that the EU needed to display some of the creativity it had applied in the past.He said: “We have designed our proposals both to respect the result of the referendum, and the core principles of the EU. We have considered the innovative approaches the EU has taken in the past with other third countries – when the political will has been there.”Barnier offered the UK some cause for hope with regard to its temporary customs proposals, which are designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the period before the final arrangements are ready. The technology needed for the UK’s customs plan in the white paper, in the unlikely event of a U-turn by Barnier, is not expected to be ready until 2022 at the earliest.The EU is seeking what Barnier likes to call “an-all weather insurance policy”, known as the backstop, that would kick into place should the two sides be unable to agree a new trading relationship.The commission’s negotiator conceded that a UK-wide customs plan, avoiding a border in the Irish sea, was the goal, rather than one that simply kept Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs territory.“We have no objection in principle to this,” Barnier said. “But we have doubts that this can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.”He said Raab had promised to answer those concerns when they meet again in mid-August.The two men clashed on whether the Brexit orce treaty would be reopened over the bill: the UK’s debts accrued over 45 years of membership that British officials estimate to be £39bn. Raab said there needed to be “conditionality” tying the Brexit orce bill to the deal on future relations.Barnier countered: “It is quite clear that what has been agreed in December and agreed in March has been agreed for good,” referring to the deals May signed with EU leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1987e7fafa408d9d1f668f4f400040f5f72a0e1a/0_586_4547_2727/master/4547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c18c7362473737a77d8c779d3963c27","title":"in vitro fertilisation 40 years on science weekly podcast","story":"This week, the world’s first IVF baby turned 40.

His right arm, right leg and right shoulder are all heavily bandaged from the crash he suffered on Wednesday afternoon. Sagan’s fall wasn’t captured by the TV cameras, but it seems to have been a sickeningly heavy one. He looked ashen-faced when he crossed the line on Wednesday evening, his shirt was shredded and by his own account, he said he “hit a rock with my ass, really hard”. He’ll have a time limit to finish inside this afternoon and it seems quite clear he’s already struggling in these early stages. 193km to go: Damien Gaudin (Direct Energie), Lukas Pöstlberger (Bora) and Silvan Dillier (AG2R) form a little three-man breakaway, putting about 19 seconds into the rest of the bunch.

There is a sense of an actor putting the finest last touches to his majestic legacy: in McKellen’s incarnation as the arrogant ruler undone by age, infirmity and filial disobedience. Jonathan Munby’s modern production bears the added weight of being staged in the theatre where McKellen made his West End debut in 1964, as his tweet goes on to say. It transfers from a first run at Chichester festival theatre and, in an attempt to keep the intimacy of that original setting, a false wall has been erected, while a ramp runs through the centre to extend the action into the auditorium and reduce the size of the audience to just over 500. It allows McKellen to play the part with a naturalism that initially seems risky in its illustrious West End context but pays off for its deep melancholic charge.McKellen’s Lear seems half-absent in the opening scene as he invites his daughters’ praise in return for his kingdom, not with imperious demand but with casual entitlement. The staging speaks his power for him – a large union jack spread across the set, guards nodding their deference and an oversized self-portrait that hangs centre stage, painted in the style of Rembrandt’s last portrait and like it, prefiguring Lear’s end with his face already half in shade.This is not the declamatory monarch McKellen played in Trevor Nunn’s 2007 production, tearing off his trousers in the histrionics of the heath scene. It is a quickly broken Lear. His lines are spoken softly, stumbled upon, croaked out or interrupted by tears and occasional capers to show his ignominious decline. McKellen draws out Lear’s signs of dementia – the angry outbursts, the sudden memory blanks – and infuses his performance with such compassion that we feel for this “discarded father” long before his breakdown in the storm.The play is indeterminately modern in its setting: the dress code is that of a 1930s drawing room, though the army’s camouflage fatigues and guns suggest a more contemporary era. The drama happens in wood-panelled rooms and chandeliered dining halls but props fall away after the storm to open up to a barer stage set and a stark white backdrop on Lear’s arrival to Dover.The contemporary setting is a perfect fit for the nihilism at the heart of the play in its obsession with being and nothingness and Shakespeare’s subtle and heretical challenge to the biblical concept of a soul. Lear is both the ancient Celtic king of curses and superstition and the existential antihero, questioning what, if anything, lies at the centre of his being once his worldly titles are stripped away.The lighting is sleek and cinematic: characters are spotlit for an instant before the stage falls to black again, and the mood is set on edge with sudden bursts of thrillerish music. It gives the production its clarity and pace in the first part – a rare achievement for a play of epic proportions, opaque plotlines and anguished depths. The filmic elements remain subtle until Gloucester’s eyes are gouged out. A sexually perverse Regan flicks on the radio and dances with voyeuristic delight as Gloucester is tied to a chair and blinded, channelling the seminal scene of violence from Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. It is a heavy-handed cross-reference, and it works, but it changes the tenor of the play, bringing out the dark comedy that has until now remained under the surface.Kirsty Bushell’s Regan becomes ever more ham as a simpering, hypersexual sadist, while James Corrigan amps up the villainy as Edmund, glinting with malice in conspiratorial soliloquies. Both are entertaining characterisations but have a touch of pantomime. Whatever its inconsistencies and imperfections, this production still dazzles, McKellen shimmering brightest at its dark, tormented heart. At the Duke of York’s until 3 November. The play will be broadcast live on 27 September with National Theatre Live."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1bbdf3b8cf78b143b58a57df5e907917a6fbfae/0_169_2381_1428/master/2381.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f8d683d5182ff2295cd1652cc9ecf26","title":"top 10 waterparks uk swimming lidos paddleboarding kayaking","story":"Whether it’s hurtling down a waterslide or a spot of paddleboarding, an aquapark on a summer’s day is always funThe Blue Lagoon waterpark is part of the Bluestone holiday resort, but day visitors are welcome.

His nearest rival, Shahbaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz party won 63 seats. Sharif, who heads the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, has rejected the results, alleging widespread fraud and manipulation.Probation shake-up – The monitoring of offenders in the community faces another shake-up after reforms introduced by Chris Grayling forced the government to bail out failing private probation companies by more than half a billion pounds.

About 7,700 US soldiers are listed as missing from the 1950-53 Korean war, and the remains of 5,300 are believed to still be in North Korea.Blood moon spoiler – Torrential rain and thunderstorms could hinder skygazers from seeing the “blood moon” lunar eclipse in some parts of the country tonight as forecasters warn of heavy downpours across eastern parts of Great Britain.

It could spoil your chance of seeing the longest lunar eclipse of the century – which will start at 8.49pm – and has dampened the record heat predictions for today (but for those who have loved the heat, you can look at how the newspapers’ pun-loving headline-writers have marked this week’s scorcher here). If the skies happen to be clear above you, the moon will rise with a deep, rusty red colour as it is totally eclipsed by the earth. About half an hour later, Mars will rise in the same place, brighter than usual in an astronomical coincidence that places it closer to us than at any time in the past 15 years. Both should be visible to the naked eye.Does your postcode tell you something about the books you like to read? Thrillers – in particular those by the US author James Patterson (most borrowed for the 11th year in a row with Paula Hawkins’ The Girl on the Train topping UK authors) – continue to exert an inexorable pull for the majority of the UK’s library users, according to figures from Public Lending Right, part of the Department of Digital, Culture Media and Sport. But thrillers are particularly popular in the north-east, with seven of the top 10 books borrowed from libraries coming from the crimethriller genre. In the north-west and Merseyside, nine of the top 10 books were from this genre and in Wales it was 10 out of 10. But the figures show that in England’s eastern counties, readers made Milly Johnson’s novel Sunshine over Wildflower Cottage their top read, and in the south-east, Jojo Moyes’s sequel to Me Before You, After You, topped the charts, with Maeve Binchy also riding high. In the south-west, meanwhile, the top nine titles borrowed from libraries were all by Roald Dahl, while in Northern Ireland, Jeff Kinney and other children’s authors filled out the top 10.Geraint Thomas will avoid riding close to the crowds lining the route during today’s key Tour de France mountain stage after a spectator deliberately grabbed him and nearly caused him to crash on stage 17, which was won by Arnaud Démare.

The Pakistan Peoples Party came third with 43 seats.Khan will still need to form a coalition to become prime minister, which requires at least 137 seats, but a single party winning contests across the country – in the north, south and Punjab – is rare in Pakistani politics. The ease with which the PTI can implement its policy agenda also received a significant boost from its strong performance in state-level elections.As well as forming the federal government, the PTI’s capture of 118 seats in the provincial assembly of Punjab, the largest and wealthiest province, means it has a good chance of evicting the PML-N from the state government there, a stronghold that its leadership, even as they contemplated defeat, had been desperate to protect.In a televised victory speech on Thursday, Khan struck a unifiying tone, pledging to lift up the poor and allow the rigging claims to be investigated.The PML-N founder, Nawaz Sharif, told family from the prison cell where he is serving a 10-year sentence for corruption that he considered the result “stolen”.Also known as the Justice party, it is led by the former cricketer\u0026nbspImran Khan, and has had some success at provincial level but has never been able to convert it into national power.

Tried and\u0026nbspsentenced\u0026nbspin absentia, he returned to the country this month to serve his sentence, hoping to revitalise the campaign before the election.Now led by Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, the party is focusing on its economic success and promises of energy and infrastructure investment from China. However, efforts to increase tax revenues have faltered.Led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The party lost ground after Benazir was killed in 2007 but the family name still carries considerable weight. The third-generation leader appears to be playing a long game, rebuilding support in its heartland with an eye on future elections. If it does well in this vote, the PPP could potentially serve as a junior partner in a coalition.GenAsif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesperson, drew criticism after tweeting “You honour who You will and You humble who You will”, a verse from the Qur’an that was taken in some quarters as confirmation of the military’s support for Khan.The trickle of official results threw up surprises. Top PML-N leaders performed worse than expected. The former prime minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who took up the role after the ousting of Sharif, lost both the constituencies he was contesting.The former finance minister Miftah Ismail posted on Twitter that he was “looking for work” after his own defeat. Shahbaz Sharif, Nawaz’s brother and the new leader of the party, scraped into parliament after losing three of the four seats he contested.Although Tehreek-e-Labbaik, a new far-right Islamist party dedicated to killing blasphemers, failed to win any national seats, its strong second-place in many contests raised fears that it will influence the future of Pakistani politics.Analyst Umair Javed told the  that the scale of Khan’s win across the country made the PTI a rare “truly national party”. It won a two-thirds majority in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the first since 1951, while at the other end of Pakistan, in the southern business capital of Karachi, the party vastly outperformed expectations to claim half the seats.That might reflect a shift away from ethnicity-based politics in both regions, said Javed.A former PML-N cabinet minister, Khawaja Saad Rafique, petitioned for a recount of his defeat to Imran Khan in the capital of Punjab, Lahore. He said the presiding officer at the polling station “rejected” many votes.The PML-N will host a conference of opposition leaders in Islamabad on Friday to discuss their response after all said that the vote was rigged, with their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – evicted from ballot booths by security officials. At a party meeting on Thursday, the PML-N decided against boycotting parliament."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577461.1532643917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit talks are almost out of time but is an extension possible","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA placard outside the Houses of Parliament. Photograph: Simon Dawson\u0026nbsp“The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.” – – Article 50 (3), Lisbon TreatyYes, the UK can seek an extension to its EU membership beyond March 31st to facilitate discussions on its stalled Withdrawal Agreement. If, that is, all the member states agree to such an extension.All this talk in Brussels and London of time running out, of insuperable obstacles like the Irish backstop, and the real possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit has given currency to the idea of an extension.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both suggested in recent days that they would be open to the idea, although London has preferred instead to talk of accelerating or invigorating the talks, as if a reluctant Brussels is responsible for negotiations foot-dragging. Ha!Many Brexiteers now say privately, however, that almost any concession by London on the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) – not including a border in the Irish Sea – should be contemplated just to get the UK out of the EU on March 31st. Freedom! So the idea of extending UK membership is likely to be politically toxic in the Tory party.It would certainly be portrayed as the first step in betraying the Brexit cause, an incremental remain.Another way of circumventing the backstop roadblock, London would say, would be to kick discussions on it out of the WA framework and into the transition period when the UK will have left the EU but talks on the shape of a future relationship will be getting under way. The Border issue, they have always argued, is more easily resolved in the context of an overall settlement of that relationship.But seductive as that transition option might be – it was apparently advocated by a Polish minister last week – it remains completely unacceptable to the Irish and EU negotiators. It might appear simply to be another version of the article 50 extension breathing space for talks, but in truth it is a horse of an entirely different colour.Removing the backstop issue from the WA, which has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, would be necessary for the issue to be kicked forward to transition.That would represent both a formal repudiation of a key element of the joint accord reached in December between the EU task force and the UK, and, just as importantly, a dangerous backsliding on a previously agreed policy that would inevitably call into question all agreed outcomes in the talks.The corollary of the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is that the process can also not involve endless renegotiation of settled matters.Crucially, the separation of the backstop issue from the WA would remove important leverage on the EU side, fatally undermining its ability to safeguard the special position of Northern Ireland. The UK needs a WA to have any prospect of an orderly Brexit and the vital transition. That means it must now, not later, face up to hard choices – notably some controls on the Irish Sea – or lose everything in a painful no-deal, no-transition exit.That much was again made abundantly clear to the Poles at the ministerial meeting last week when, once again, many member states rallied round the Irish. It is believed that they would not, however, stand in the way of an article 50 extension.That, however politically unpalatable in London, would simply allow more time for the WA to be agreed, undermining none of the previously made undertakings. And none of the hard choices for the UK.For the time being, however, London is not asking. Two months of unproductive summer discussions, with an October summit deal in doubt, may well bring a different perspective.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The rest did not know.The poll of 1,653 adults in the United Kingdom was conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week, The Times said.Fifty-eight per cent of Labour voters, 67 per cent of Liberal Democrat voters and 21 per cent of Conservative voters supported a second referendum.In the June 23rd, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million votes, or 51.9 percent of votes cast, backed leaving the EU while 16.1 million votes, or 48.1 percent of votes cast, backed staying. Many opinion polls were wrong about the result.Two years on from the referendum, the YouGov poll showed that the views of most voters on whether to leave had not changed.In the event of a referendum on Britain’s EU membership tomorrow, 45 per cent said that they would vote to remain, while 42 per cent would vote to leave, with 4 per cent saying that they would not vote and 9 per cent saying they did not know, The Times said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. UK weather: Heatwave set to bring highs of 37C on hottest day of year -

The extended weather warning for storms is in force from 2pm until 2am on Saturday and up to 60mm (2.3in) of rain in three hours is predicted for some areas.Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-30s for much of east and south east England, reaching an estimated 37C in London on so-called Furnace Friday. That would make it the hottest ever July day ahead of the previous record of 36.7C, which was set in Heathrow in 2015.

Some areas will see a more than 10C drop between Friday and Saturday - bringing some relief to gardeners, farmers and water companies.Mr Deakin added: Weather fronts are trying to come in from the Atlantic and eventually they will do so. And that has the impact of ousting the really hot and humid air .. it turns runs cooler for the weekend, fresher, more comfortable at night....From green to brown in a month: Satellite images show how Britain has changedA mix of toxic air, extreme highs, emissions from the continent and a lack of cloud cover caused a high air pollution alert to be issued for London.Meanwhile, authorities said the heatwave was causing winter conditions in parts of the NHS, while many nurses were said to be dizzy and exhausted.Fire brigades also called for a ban on BBQs in parks and drivers were urged not to throw rubbish following a string of grassland fires in recent weeks.Large parts of northern Europe are also gripped by extreme hot weather, but a Met Office map showed the south east of England was hotter than anywhere else on the continent on Thursday.The Met Office and Public Health England\u0027s level three heat health watch alert covers a large part of England and warns people to stay out of the sun until Friday.Britain is just one stage away from a national emergency, which will be triggered if healthy people start becoming seriously ill - but visits to the NHS Choices website have already risen by 450 per cent as people struggle with heat exhaustion and sunstroke. The Met Office yellow warning for thunderstorms is in force between 2pm on Friday and 2am on Saturday.It has been extended to cover London and the south east - as well as a large belt of the east of Britain, up East Anglia and the north east.A severe weather warning for thunderstorms, in force from 2pm on Friday to 2am on SaturdayThe warning says people should expect:Flooding of homes and businesses could happen quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong windsWhere flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train and bus servicesSpray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closuresPower cuts might occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lostRain clouds and thunderstorms could prevent skygazers from seeing the blood moon lunar eclipse. The rare celestial event, said to be the longest in the 21st century, will see the moon pass through Earth\u0027s darkest shadow and take on a red sheen.Moonrise will be at 8.49pm in London, 9.46pm in Glasgow, 9.02pm in Cardiff and 9.27pm in Belfast, with mid-eclipse occurring at 9.21pm and the total phase ending at around 10.13pm. But torrential downpours are forecast in places, with as much as 1.2 inches (30mm) expected to fall in just an hour and 2.4 inches (60mm) in three hours.A lightning storm passes over the south coast of England as seen from Gosport, Hampshire, at 4am on Friday, ahead of a Met Office severe weather warningMet Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: There may be large areas where the sky is effectively covered by thunderclouds. They will move through reasonably quickly but if that coincides with the peak moment of the eclipse, they could obscure the moon.The warning area extends from Cambridge and Peterborough up to the Scottish Borders, Mr Madge said, adding that Wales, the south and west of England and most of Northern Ireland should have clear skies.Although the lunar eclipse is expected to last 103 minutes, observers in the UK and Ireland will not be able to catch the start as the moon will still be below the horizon. However, the partial eclipse will be visible for almost four hours.Mars will add to the spectacle shining brightly below the blood moon as it reaches perihelic opposition - where the Red Planet and the sun are on directly opposite sides of Earth.And those awake after 11pm will be able to catch a glimpse of the International Space Station (ISS), as it moves quickly across the sky from west to east. It will appear like a bright star, before fading from sight a few minutes later.Unlike a solar eclipse, the lunar event can be viewed without wearing protective eye gear. The next total lunar eclipse in the UK will take place on January 19 2019.Cross-Channel rail operator Eurotunnel has cancelled thousands of tickets after extreme temperatures caused major disruption to services.The firm took the unprecedented decision to stop passengers from travelling on Friday if they were due to return on the same day or Saturday in a bid to ease long queues.Passengers faced delays of up to six-and-a-half hours on Thursday when air-conditioning units failed on trains. And as of Friday morning, the operator was warning of delays of three-and-a-half hours.Long queues for the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, Kent, on Thursday afternoonEurotunnel said: The prolonged and unprecedented temperatures in the South East of England are affecting the air conditioning on board our shuttles.Due to the high level of traffic booked, we are currently unable to check-in any customers arriving more than two hours before their booked crossing time.We strongly recommend that you stock up with water and take a comfort break prior to arriving at our Folkestone Terminal.Passengers wait in long queues at the Eurotunnel terminal in Folkestone on Friday morningOn Thursday, Eurotunnel warned that ferry companies do not have availability to take any of our customers.It is one of the busiest weeks of the year for cross-Channel travel as the start of many school summer holidays leads to a surge in family trips.Water rescue teams are searching for a 17-year-old boy who went missing after going into a lake at a quarry.Emergency services were called to the Bishops Bowl Lakes area in Bishops Itchington, near Leamington Spa, at about 6.30pm on Thursday, Warwickshire Police said.Concerns were raised for the teenager after he entered the water, the force said.Police roadblock in Bishops Itchington, Warwickshire, as rescuers search for the missing teenager in a nearby lakeSearches are expected to continue throughout the day and a cordon and road closures around the area are in place.

We\u0027ve made improvements to the ventilation systems on the current fleet.New trains are coming in early 2030, under the Deep Tube Upgrade Program which will be delivered with full air cooling systems.Nurses have reported feeling exhausted, sick and dizzy as the hot weather raises temperatures in hospitals. One nurse was admitted to A\u0026ampE with dehydration after working three 12-hours shifts in a row during the heatwave, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said.Earlier this week, the organisation warned that patients and relatives were passing out and vomiting, with temperatures on some wards exceeding 30C (86F). It also said some nurses were not allowed to take water bottles on to wards.Kim Sunley, national officer at the RCN, said: Nurses are now becoming patients themselves due to the heat. We have heard from one member who ended up in A\u0026ampE suffering from dehydration, after working 12-hour shifts back to back in temperatures exceeding 30C. Others have reported exhaustion, sickness and dizziness.This is not acceptable. Good patient care depends on nurses and clinical support assistants being well enough to perform their jobs effectively.It is vital employers adapt working practices to the heat. Both patients and nurses must have easy access to water, and all healthcare staff should be able to take regular breaks, preferably somewhere cool.Britain is ill-prepared to cope with heatwaves, a major report by MPs has warned. The Commons environmental audit committee said that adapting to a warming climate was now a matter of life and death and without action, thousands of Britons would die each year, reports Sarah Knapton.The committee said rules brought in to make modern homes and offices more energy efficient had left householders and workers to swelter in overly insulated buildings with little ventilation. It called for updated guidelines.The MPs\u0027 report also said that road and rail services had not been built to cope with such hot weather, with just half of Britain\u0027s motorways surfaced with material that can withstand high temperatures and rail tracks increasingly at risk of buckling.A commuter feels the heat on London Bridge on what is predicted to be the hottest day of the yearThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) warned that people were vomiting and passing out from the heat and MPs said health guidance should be issued to employers and schools to relax dress and uniform codes and allow flexible working.A survey carried out by the committee also found schools were so hot in summer that nine in 10 teachers are forced to pay for fans to make classrooms bearable.MPs warned that by the 2040s, Britain would face similar heatwaves every two years, and called for a minister to be appointed to tackle the growing crisis. Farming leaders have warned that crops are being hit and livestock are having to be fed with feed that should be held for winter as grasslands are parched.The dry spell has been most prolonged in East Anglia and south-east England where the last day of very widespread rainfall was seen on May 29.Dry earth cracks in a farmer\u0026#39s field near Altringham, CheshireFirefighters have urged the public to avoid careless and reckless behaviour during the ongoing heatwave as crews across the country deal with a high number of field fires.And pet owners have been urged to avoid exercising their dogs and other animals in the hottest parts of the day due to the risk of burnt paws on scorching pavements, as well as the chance of heatstroke.Video: How to keep gardens looking healthy in the heatThe heatwave baking Britain comes as extreme hot weather grips northern Europe.The UK has seen the driest half of summer on record, with just 47mm (1.85 inches) of rain between June 1 and July 16.The Met Office said several places have had 54 consecutive dry days, starting on May 30, including a few which have had less than 1mm (0.04in) of rain in the entire 54-day period - the longest spell since 1969, when 70 days passed with no significant rainfall.The longest run of days with no rain at all this summer so far is 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds, since June 5.Conditions this week have been nearer normal for the time of year in Northern Ireland and western Scotland, which are seeing lower temperatures and rainy spells.A leading surgeon has recommended people drink three litres of water a day and said a radical culture change towards drinking water is required to help the country stay hydrated during the heatwave.Bhaskar Somani, a consultant urological surgeon at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said attitudes towards water consumption remained poor even among those at higher risk of health problems.He said: We should take this opportunity to remind people that consumption of three litres of water a day is a small price to pay to help maintain and improve your health, particularly during heatwave spells such as the one we are in right now.How to cope in hot weatherHe spoke out following a study of 162 patients who received treatment for kidney stones - for which poor hydration is a significant risk factor - at Southampton General Hospital.It found less than a third (28 per cent) increased their water intake, despite receiving advice after treatment on the need to drink 2.5 to 3 litres a day, particularly in the summer months, with the average intake of water at around 1.5 litres.Almost a quarter (22 per cent) said the reason for avoiding water was because they did not like the taste, while 26 per cent blamed their habits and 10 per cent said they only drank when thirsty.What has triggered this heat?In the short term, the current weather phenomenon can be attributed largely to the position and the strength of jet streams - fast moving air typically five to seven miles above the Earth\u0027s surface. Such jet streams are crucial to bringing in new weather systems.What does that mean?Becky Mitchell, meteorologist at the Met Office in Exeter, said: The jet streams are not very strong to the north of the UK. When the jet stream is like that, it means we\u0027re under a period of high pressure, currently drawing up hot and humid air from France.Sometimes it is just a feature of the weather at the time. However, this prolonged period of dry and very warm weather will inevitably cause scientists to look at the long-term impact global warming is having on the planet.What would ordinarily be happening across the UK at this time of year?Again, when the jet stream is further south it means cooler weather systems are able to come in from the Atlantic. That is not happening at the moment, hence the extended period of hot temperatures.Will we have much more of this?In short, yes. It is probably fair to say that things will get worse (that is to say, hotter) before they get better. And it\u0027s all building towards Friday being the hottest day of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 36C (96.8F) in the south east before dropping back to the high 20s again. Interestingly, despite the driest start to summer since 1961, the previous three years have each had a top temperature exceeding 33.3C (91.9F), the record high for 2018 so far.Any chance of rain?Succour is on its way. Thunderstorms are expected in parts of eastern and northern England on Friday, according to the Met Office, with a chance of hail and strong winds alongside the torrential downpours.But will it actually make any difference?The volume and persistence of the rainfall will have a variable impact on the overall temperature. Extended periods of very hot and dry weather mean the ground has itself been heated - a light shower is going to do little to change that. Nor is it likely to fill the reservoirs, which are in desperate need of a top-up. But many gardeners and farmers are crying out for rain. Any cooling of the temperatures will be particularly welcomed by dog walkers, who have been forced to take their pets out very early in the morning or late at night when the temperatures have dropped to something less punishing.For more UK weather news, click here.Please review our commenting policyPublic concern about Brexit hits record high after a tumultuous month in ParliamentPakistan election results: Imran Khan prepares for coalition talks after contested voteUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightNHS increasingly desperate for nurses and midwives as applications continue to fallCalifornia wildfires: TV station evacuated live on air as thousands fleeTrump\u0026#39s former lawyer claims president knew about secret election meeting with Russian informantFive dead and five injured in minibus crash in north of ScotlandComment: Scroll-free September: could you quit social media for a month? Humans star Katherine Parkinson: \u0026#39#MeToo could lead to a schism between men and women\u0026#39How does 2018’s scorching summer compare to the great heatwave of 1976?Scottish Natural Heritage accused of \u0026#39reaching for the shotgun\u0026#39 by allowing too many bird cullsComment: In his assault on liberal guilt over race, Sajid Javid is putting his Labour opponents to shameDonald Trump thanks Kim Jong-un for returning remains of American soldiers killed in Korean WarOrca mother keeps her dead calf afloat in extraordinary display of griefThree people arrested after \u0026#39shots fired at police\u0026#39 in east LondonHundreds of migrant children still not returned to parents amid warnings they are disappearing into \u0026#39black hole\u0026#39Scroll free September: NHS endorses mental health campaign to get children to give up social media for one monthOfficers restore order after inmates \u0026#39riot\u0026#39 at Lowdham Grange PrisonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/27/TELEMMGLPICT000170415202_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwWwNLrOnXfPdYNkDbyWiJsY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk weather heatwave bring highs 37c hottest day year lightning","story":"Lightning above the three bridges over the Firth of Forth in Scotland on Thursday night ahead of a Met Office severe weather warning for FridayBritain\u0027s heatwave could bring its most intense weather conditions yet, with a record high of 37C (98.6F) forecast for Friday along with severe thunderstorms.After lightning arrived earlier than expected in some areas, motorists are warned of flash flooding and large hailstones that could hit London, the south east and the eastern coast in the afternoon.

It called for updated guidelines.The MPs\u0027 report also said that road and rail services had not been built to cope with such hot weather, with just half of Britain\u0027s motorways surfaced with material that can withstand high temperatures and rail tracks increasingly at risk of buckling.A commuter feels the heat on London Bridge on what is predicted to be the hottest day of the yearThe Royal College of Nursing (RCN) warned that people were vomiting and passing out from the heat and MPs said health guidance should be issued to employers and schools to relax dress and uniform codes and allow flexible working.A survey carried out by the committee also found schools were so hot in summer that nine in 10 teachers are forced to pay for fans to make classrooms bearable.MPs warned that by the 2040s, Britain would face similar heatwaves every two years, and called for a minister to be appointed to tackle the growing crisis. Farming leaders have warned that crops are being hit and livestock are having to be fed with feed that should be held for winter as grasslands are parched.The dry spell has been most prolonged in East Anglia and south-east England where the last day of very widespread rainfall was seen on May 29.Dry earth cracks in a farmer\u0026#39s field near Altringham, CheshireFirefighters have urged the public to avoid careless and reckless behaviour during the ongoing heatwave as crews across the country deal with a high number of field fires.And pet owners have been urged to avoid exercising their dogs and other animals in the hottest parts of the day due to the risk of burnt paws on scorching pavements, as well as the chance of heatstroke.Video: How to keep gardens looking healthy in the heatThe heatwave baking Britain comes as extreme hot weather grips northern Europe.The UK has seen the driest half of summer on record, with just 47mm (1.85 inches) of rain between June 1 and July 16.The Met Office said several places have had 54 consecutive dry days, starting on May 30, including a few which have had less than 1mm (0.04in) of rain in the entire 54-day period - the longest spell since 1969, when 70 days passed with no significant rainfall.The longest run of days with no rain at all this summer so far is 48 days at Brooms Barn, near Bury St Edmunds, since June 5.Conditions this week have been nearer normal for the time of year in Northern Ireland and western Scotland, which are seeing lower temperatures and rainy spells.A leading surgeon has recommended people drink three litres of water a day and said a radical culture change towards drinking water is required to help the country stay hydrated during the heatwave.Bhaskar Somani, a consultant urological surgeon at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, said attitudes towards water consumption remained poor even among those at higher risk of health problems.He said: We should take this opportunity to remind people that consumption of three litres of water a day is a small price to pay to help maintain and improve your health, particularly during heatwave spells such as the one we are in right now.How to cope in hot weatherHe spoke out following a study of 162 patients who received treatment for kidney stones - for which poor hydration is a significant risk factor - at Southampton General Hospital.It found less than a third (28 per cent) increased their water intake, despite receiving advice after treatment on the need to drink 2.5 to 3 litres a day, particularly in the summer months, with the average intake of water at around 1.5 litres.Almost a quarter (22 per cent) said the reason for avoiding water was because they did not like the taste, while 26 per cent blamed their habits and 10 per cent said they only drank when thirsty.What has triggered this heat?In the short term, the current weather phenomenon can be attributed largely to the position and the strength of jet streams - fast moving air typically five to seven miles above the Earth\u0027s surface. Such jet streams are crucial to bringing in new weather systems.What does that mean?Becky Mitchell, meteorologist at the Met Office in Exeter, said: The jet streams are not very strong to the north of the UK. When the jet stream is like that, it means we\u0027re under a period of high pressure, currently drawing up hot and humid air from France.Sometimes it is just a feature of the weather at the time. However, this prolonged period of dry and very warm weather will inevitably cause scientists to look at the long-term impact global warming is having on the planet.What would ordinarily be happening across the UK at this time of year?Again, when the jet stream is further south it means cooler weather systems are able to come in from the Atlantic. That is not happening at the moment, hence the extended period of hot temperatures.Will we have much more of this?In short, yes. It is probably fair to say that things will get worse (that is to say, hotter) before they get better. And it\u0027s all building towards Friday being the hottest day of the year, with temperatures expected to hit 36C (96.8F) in the south east before dropping back to the high 20s again. Interestingly, despite the driest start to summer since 1961, the previous three years have each had a top temperature exceeding 33.3C (91.9F), the record high for 2018 so far.Any chance of rain?Succour is on its way. Thunderstorms are expected in parts of eastern and northern England on Friday, according to the Met Office, with a chance of hail and strong winds alongside the torrential downpours.But will it actually make any difference?The volume and persistence of the rainfall will have a variable impact on the overall temperature. Extended periods of very hot and dry weather mean the ground has itself been heated - a light shower is going to do little to change that. Nor is it likely to fill the reservoirs, which are in desperate need of a top-up. But many gardeners and farmers are crying out for rain. Any cooling of the temperatures will be particularly welcomed by dog walkers, who have been forced to take their pets out very early in the morning or late at night when the temperatures have dropped to something less punishing.For more UK weather news, click here.Please review our commenting policyPublic concern about Brexit hits record high after a tumultuous month in ParliamentPakistan election results: Imran Khan prepares for coalition talks after contested voteUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightNHS increasingly desperate for nurses and midwives as applications continue to fallCalifornia wildfires: TV station evacuated live on air as thousands fleeTrump\u0026#39s former lawyer claims president knew about secret election meeting with Russian informantFive dead and five injured in minibus crash in north of ScotlandComment: Scroll-free September: could you quit social media for a month? Humans star Katherine Parkinson: \u0026#39#MeToo could lead to a schism between men and women\u0026#39How does 2018’s scorching summer compare to the great heatwave of 1976?Scottish Natural Heritage accused of \u0026#39reaching for the shotgun\u0026#39 by allowing too many bird cullsComment: In his assault on liberal guilt over race, Sajid Javid is putting his Labour opponents to shameDonald Trump thanks Kim Jong-un for returning remains of American soldiers killed in Korean WarOrca mother keeps her dead calf afloat in extraordinary display of griefThree people arrested after \u0026#39shots fired at police\u0026#39 in east LondonHundreds of migrant children still not returned to parents amid warnings they are disappearing into \u0026#39black hole\u0026#39Scroll free September: NHS endorses mental health campaign to get children to give up social media for one monthOfficers restore order after inmates \u0026#39riot\u0026#39 at Lowdham Grange PrisonWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/27/08/gettyimages-800630028.jpg","title":"jeff goldblum tv show curiosity national geographic documentary","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe Independent CultureJeff Goldblum is nothing if not curious.

Since then, areas like\u0026nbspPeckham and Frome\u0026nbsphave taken the message on as their ownClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom Bristol to LA: The anti-gentrification posters sweeping through our citiesLast summer, stickers and posters began to appear on the walls of Bristol. In a gnomic parody of Trump’s “Make America Great Again“ they read “Make Bristol Shit Again”, and were plastered over the city’s gentrifying high-tide areas, such as Stokes Croft and St Pauls.\u0026nbspThe city talked. Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.This showed the star\u0027s orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole.The star\u0027s wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said.The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years, MPE\u0027s Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

For Brexit to make it easier for people to illicitly smuggle goods across our border and not pay their way is simply unacceptable.\u0026nbsp“Nobody in Britain voted for the return to a golden age of smuggling.”Campaigners have voiced their fears\u0026nbspas Mr Barnier\u0026nbspeffectively rejected the customs plan, saying that\u0026nbspretaining control of the EU’s money,\u0026nbsplaw and borders also applied to the European Union’s customs policy.Speaking at a press conference in Brussels with\u0026nbspnew Brexit secretary\u0026nbspDominic Raab, Mr Barnier said: “The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU’s governance structures.”Any customs arrangement or union “must respect this principle”, he added.The row comes\u0026nbspamid growing fears about the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, as Ms May’s Chequers proposals\u0026nbsprevealed deep isions within Conservative ranks and put pressure on her wafer thin Commons majority.The prime minister has urged voters not to worry about\u0026nbspBrexit, despite a string of revelations from ministers about plans to stockpile food, blood and medicines.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March next year.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is the first time the pollster found the proportion of voters who favour a second vote overtaking those who do not, the newspaper added.“With each passing day it’s obvious that Brexit can’t be left to the politicians.

It should be your #Finalsay.”It also comes as a key proposal in the prime minister’s Brexit blueprint – outlined in her Chequers agreement – was rejected by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier.Central to the prime minister\u0027s plan, set out in a white paper a fortnight ago, is a facilitated customs arrangement under which tariffs charged at the border would be passed on to either the British or EU authorities depending on the destination of imported goods.Appearing alongside new Brexit secretary Dominic Raab following their second round of talks in Brussels, Michel Barnier left no doubt that this was not acceptable to the EU.The EU cannot and the EU will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU\u0027s governance structures, he said.Any customs arrangement or union must respect this principle.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Michel Barnier does not represent only the Commission. He is the negotiator for the European Union,” she said.“He gets his mandate and his guidelines from the heads of state and government. And we have discussed it regularly at the level of ministers. We meet with Michel Barnier on a regular basis.\u0026nbsp“So do the heads of state and government.

Mr Grewal is Sikh.Dennis Malloy and Judi Franco, who host a conservative-leaning talk show every day from 10am to 2pm on New Jersey 101.5 FM, will be off the air for 10 days, the station announced.We take these comments seriously and echo Dennis and Judi\u0027s sincere apology to Attorney General Grewal and his family, as well as the Sikh and Asian communities, Ron deCastro, the station\u0027s president, said in a statement posted on its website. Dennis and Judi are known for their plainspoken brand of humour, but in this case, the language used was clearly demeaning and inappropriate.Mr Grewal, a first-generation American who grew up in Essex, New Jersey, became the country\u0027s first Sikh state attorney general when he took office earlier this year. Mr Malloy and Ms Franco were discussing his recent order to suspend marijuana prosecutions in the state when Mr Malloy said he would never know Mr Grewal\u0027s name and would just call him the guy with the turban.Yeah, turban man, Mr Malloy said. And listen if that offends you, then don\u0027t wear the turban, man. I\u0027ll remember your name.The comments drew strong rebukes from Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker and the state\u0027s ACLU chapter, which tweeted: Racism isn\u0027t cute. It\u0027s just racist.Outraged by the abhorrent and xenophobic comments mocking @NewJerseyOAG on The @DennisandJudi Show, Mr Murphy, a Democrat who appointed Mr Grewal, wrote on Twitter. Hate speech has no place in NJ, and does not belong on our airwaves.Mr Grewal responded as well.My name, for the record, is Gurbir Grewal, he wrote on Twitter. I\u0027m the 61st Attorney General of NJ. I\u0027m a Sikh American. I have 3 daughters. And yesterday, I told them to turn off the radio.Sikhs in the United States have been the target of slurs and hate crimes and are sometimes confused with Muslims. Men who follow the religion typically wear a beard and turban.Mr Grewal also shared a video from a speech he gave at the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies in which he talked about the ways racism had affected his political career.Scroll through any of the online comments about my work or my office or any news story, it can really be stomach turning, he said, noting that he\u0027d been receiving death threats since he became attorney general. I have been called a towel-head, a raghead, a terrorist.In an interview with the New York Times last year as he prepared to take office, he spoke about how he was harassed after September 11 by a stranger who would wait outside of his office and shout, I\u0027ve found him, I\u0027ve found bin Laden!Mr Malloy issued an apology to Mr Grewal and the East Asian community in New Jersey on Thursday afternoon.Speaking on behalf of Judi and myself today in offering our heartfelt apologies to the attorney general of the state of New Jersey, who is a man who certainly deserves more respect than our comments reflected on Wednesday, Mr Malloy said in a video apology. I made a mistake on Wednesday in saying something that was out of bounds and it was wrong.The station\u0027s parent company, Townsquare Media, declined to comment.Family of murdered Sikh man blames Trump policies for \u0027racial hatred\u0027Sikh community saves Fourth of July fireworks display with $10,000Racist Snapchat story targeting Sikh man on flight sparks outrage Sikhs ask for hate-crime probe after man told \u0027go back home\u0027NYPD to allow Sikh officers to wear turban on duty According to NorthJersey, the two hosts are known for their blunt talk on everyday issues with a conservative slant. They have defended President Trump and made fun of National Public Radio and former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, while mixing in light-hearted banter and talk about the mundane aspects of everyday life, according to the website.Multiple callers phoning into the station during Mr Malloy and Ms Franco\u0027s slot on Thursday defended the hosts\u0027 remarks, according to NJ.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It now represents a total 80 per cent of the world’s population.\u0026nbspThe choice of the Palestinians as the group’s chair for\u0026nbsp2019 is a diplomatic win for Ramallah at the expense of Israel and Washington DC. Both have argued against strengthening the Palestinians’ international political clout until a peace settlement\u0026nbspis reached in the intractable Arab-Israeli conflict which agrees on the formation of an independent Palestinian state.\u0026nbspThe permanent Palestinian observer to the UN, Riyad Mansour, confirmed news of the Group 77 decision in a phone interview on Tuesday with The New York Times.\u0026nbspThe Palestinian mission to the UN was granted observer status in 2012, which made it eligible to join important bodies such as the International Criminal Court and Unesco.The Palestinians have used their membership of both agencies to further their push for statehood as well as file complaints about alleged Israeli human rights abuses\u0026nbspand settlement expansion in the West Bank.\u0026nbspPalestinian protesters clash with Israeli troops: in picturesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesTear gas canisters are fired by Israeli forces at Palestinian demonstratorsA demonstrator uses a sling to hurl stones at Israeli forcesA female demonstrator uses a slingshot to hurl stones at Israeli forces A demonstrator with a slingshot looks on Female Palestinian demonstrators react to tear gas fired by Israeli forces Female demonstrators run for cover from tear gas fired by Israeli forcesA demonstrator uses a racket to return a tear gas canister fired by Israeli troops Palestinian demonstrators during clashes with Israeli forcesThe move to give the Palestinians the chair of such a large delegation comes at a time of heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinians, sparked by the deteriorating humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip, and a new, significant stumbling block in the peace process in the form of US president Donald Trump\u0027s\u0026nbspadministration.\u0026nbspMr Trump’s decision to fulfil an election campaign promise last December by recognising the contested city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel sparked protests across the Muslim world.\u0026nbspIt also led the Palestinian Authority leadership to sever diplomatic relations with the US, declaring the White House could no longer be an “honest broker” between the two parties.\u0026nbspThe stalled negotiations do not sit well with Donald Trump, who has made Arab-Israeli peace – which he describes as “the ultimate deal” – a foreign policy priority.\u0026nbspIn an effort to force the Palestinians to the table, at the beginning of the year the US cut $65m\u0026nbsp(£49m) of an earmarked $125m\u0026nbspin funding to the UN’s agency for Palestinians, Unrwa.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh, let me count the ways. And believe me, it goes waaaay past ten.In fact, there are so many I feel it easier to group them together under various categories. So here goes.Eat with their mouths open stop an interesting group conversation to tell a dull, long-winded story with no point to it are overweight but claim they barely eat anything are thin but claim they eat everything pepper every, like, sentence with, like, the word “like” (Exhibit A: Anyone on Love Island) noisily slurp drinks in the cinema don’t pick up their dog’s poo make every sentence sound like a question litter the countryside don’t control their children in public places barge on to a train while you’re trying to get off read over your shoulder put bags on seats park in disabled bays when they’re clearly not live in a trillion quid mansion but claim to be socialist are glued to their mobile phone while their kid hurtles towards a road junction on its micro scooterupload ALL their holiday photos on social media, even the really crap ones say “aaah” loudly after drinking something.Aaaaaargh!Passengers who applaud when a flight lands parents who allow their kids to continually kick the back of your seat for the duration of a flight airport/rail managers who fail to boost staff numbers at peak times of the year oncoming drivers who push their way down a narrow road when you’re already three­quarters of the way along it train passengers who talk loudly on a mobile phone or think everyone else wants to listen to their ghastly music too people who cough on a crowded Tube/train without covering their mouth tailgaters drivers who don’t say thank you when you let them in middle lane hoggers packing hand luggage for a quick exit and being forced to put it in the hold.Head lice (so pointless) “Smart” TVs that make you feel anything but when trying to use the damned things novelty ringtones printed signs with spelling errors (use a pigging dictionary)online sites that won’t accept your usual password because it doesn’t have 48 squillion characters in it packaging that Harry Houdini would struggle to open roadworks with no one working on them spam emails automated phone systems immovable price stickers.Passing waiters who, when you ask for something simple like a spoon, reply: “Hang on, I’ll just get your waiter for you” shop assistants who stalk you around the rails as if you’re about to nick something fellow shoppers who start turning the rack of cards while you’re still looking at it hairdressers who chat incessantly through the supposedly “relaxing” head massage bit waiters who automatically hand the bill to the man queue-pushers at the bar bags “for life” that break the second you leave the supermarket assistants who carry on their social chat while you stand at the till waiting to be served cashiers who comment, “Ooh, are you having a party?”when you’re buying your own weekly wine supply shoppers who abuse the “ten items or less” aisle. Unless it’s me, of course.Believe me, I’m just scratching the surface here.Send me your irritations and I’ll print the best next week.Meghan Markles unpleasant half-sister Samantha is at it again – this time berating her understandably estranged royal relative for paying tribute to Nelson Mandela.“How about you pay tribute to your own father?” she ranted. “Enough is enough.Act like a humanitarian, act like a woman.If our father dies, I’m holding you responsible, Meg.”What a Grade A nasty.Meanwhile, last week Meghan’s father Thomas spent his 74th birthday picking up a Happy Meal from fast-food joint McDonald’s.Which, considering he’s just had heart stents fitted to help clear clogged arteries, suggests that if he dies any time soon, the only person responsible would be him.High-end designer ­Burberry junks £28million of unwanted products each year.A Burberry source has denied claims that they don’t donate it to charity because they don’t want the “wrong people” ­wearing it, saying that the destruction is actually to ­protect the brand against counterfeiting. Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.) Cripes.During my brief time as a Brownie in the late Sixties, I only achieved the “Hostess” badge, which entailed making a cup of tea for some visiting dignitaries at our local community centre and helping an elderly woman across the road.She didn’t want to go but, hey, a badge is a badge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day.

Our policies will be developed for the poor and for the workers.Vowing to bring peace to Afghanistan, Mr Khan added: Accountability to start from me. We will set an example in terms of law and order. Improved governance system, investment and law and order to be our priorities, he vowed.I am ashamed of living inside Prime Ministers House, it is made out of corrupted money. We will use all of Governors Houses for public use. Pakistans leaders would no longer live off the tax of the common people.We will try to bring peace to Afghanistan. We want open borders between Pakistan and Afghanistan.Although Pakistans election commission has not yet released official, he is expected to fall short of an overall majority, and may have to seek coalition partners.Khans message of a new Pakistan resonated with young voters in a country where 64 per cent of its 200 million people are below the age of 30, a United Nations report claimed.When 47 per cent of the votes were counted on Wednesday night, Mr Khans followers began to celebrate in the streets and his ex-wife hailed his victory on Twitter.Jemima - who married the famed ladies man in 1995 - said on Twitter: 22 years later, after humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices, my sons’ father is Pakistan’s next PM.It’s an incredible lesson in tenacity, belief \u0026amp refusal to accept defeat.The challenge now is to remember why he entered politics in the 1st place. Congratulations @ImranKhanPTI.The next Prime Minister is set to face a crumbling economy and violence after an ISIS fanatic blew himself up outside a polling station in Quetta yesterday as dozens cast their vote.Earlier this month another ISIS suicide bomber struck a political rally, killing 149 people including PM candidate Siraj Raisani.Most of the election night revellers were young men, who danced to the sound of beating drums draped in Tehreek-e-Insaf party black and green-coloured flags.Mr Khans Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was leading in 113 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies after votes were counted in 47 per cent of stations.Khans leading rival Shahbaz Sharif - who heads the Pakistan Muslim League, the party of jailed ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif - has already rejected the vote.But officials have denied claims of vote rigging.Khans party spokesman, Fawad Chaudhry, tweeted: Congratulations to the nation on a new Pakistan! Prime Minister Imran Khan, although his party has officially held off on declaring victory.Mr Khan himself has denied allegations that he is getting help from the military which has ruled Pakistan for almost half of its history.The army has also denied allegations of meddling in the election.Imran Khan is a cricket star-turned politician who is a leading contender in Pakistans election.Described as a quiet and shy boy in his youth Mr Khan attended the Royal Grammar School, Worcester, before completing his formal schooling with an undergraduate degree in economics from Keble College, Oxford.He was Pakistans cricket captain when the national squad won the World Cup in 1992.But after marrying Jemima in 1995, he moved into politics, founding his Tehreek-e-Insaf, the Movement for Justice party.The pairs romance generated shockwaves as he was a strict Muslim, and she was 20 years his junior.Jemima, daughter of the late Jewish financier Sir James Goldsmith, converted to Islam when she married Mr Khan, who was dubbed crickets greatest playboy in the 1980s and 1990s and was a favourite with women.The couple divorced in 2004.Mr Khans passion for politics was spurred by his renewed commitment to Islam.A profile on his party website says: As a politician, his vision is to turn Pakistan into a just society, based on humane values.[He aims to create] an independent and honest judiciary that will uphold democracy, protect human rights and ensure the rule of law.Mr Khan also hopes to provide equal opportunity for upward social mobility to the working classes.This election will mark the second transfer of power from one civilian to another in Pakistans 71-year history.The country was been under military rule on and off for a total of 33 years.Since obtaining independence in 1947, all of 29 of Pakistans Prime Ministers failed to complete a full term, with four only lasting for one day.They were booted out of office for a variety of reasons including military coups and assassination.Election campaigns were plagued for months by allegations the powerful armed forces have been trying to tilt the race in Khans favour.Military officials had fallen out with the outgoing ruling party of Shehbaz Sharif, who was jailed on corruption charges this month.Pakistans military have been accused of interefering in the election results.Around 371,000 soldiers were stationed at polling stations across the country on Wednseday, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Mr Khans rivals Benazir Bhutto who leads the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharif who leads the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, have reported of election rigging.The PML-N and the PPP both said they recieved hand-written tallies of election counts that officials could not verify, as monitors in many voting centres had not received the official notifications.PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said:  This whole election could be null and void, and we dont want this.Mr Shehbaz told a conference on election day: It is a sheer rigging. The way the peoples mandate has blatantly been insulted, it is intolerable."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422975501-e1532610204208.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may offered brexit lifeline by angela merkel who insists eu leaders give pm one last chance to sell chequers plan to them","story":"Amid mounting fears of stalemate a meeting in Salzburg in September is being lined up to give her “one last chance” to sell the proposals in her white paper to the other 27 nations.All negotiations are supposed to go through the European Commission’s lead man Michel Barnier, who has expressed concern Mrs May’s current position cannot lead to a deal.The Times is reporting that the German Chancellor Ms Merkel is frustrated the talks are not leading to a breakthrough, and is taking matters into her own hands.She is said to have suggested they use the summit scheduled in Austria for the PM to hold direct talks to avert a no-deal Brexit.A government source told the paper it could be “Britain’s last chance” to sell a compromise to the other EU leaders – who will have the final say on whether a deal can be done.Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, will now have to decide whether to let negotiations on Brexit onto the agenda of the Salzburg gathering on September 20.The shift in focus comes as the new Brexit Secretary is in Brussels hold a joint press conference with Mr Barnier.Dominic Raab promised to bring as much energy as I can ahead of the crunch talks as he tries to shift focus away from the escalating preparations for exiting without a deal.Yesterday Mrs May the British public should take reassurance and comfort from Government plans to stockpile food and medicines for after we leave.Today she told farmers at the Royal Welsh Show Brexit offers agriculture a real opportunity for the future.While meeting key industry stakeholders at Europes largest summertime agricultural show, the Tory leader set out the Governments plans for farming policy once we exit the bloc.She was given a tour of the showcase, which attracts 250,000 visitors a year with 7,000 livestock on show, in Llanelwedd, Powys.The PM was invited to hang the Best in Harness rosette on shire horse Mr Tumble, shown by Barrie Yeates, remarking that the seven-year-old giant looked too big to tumble.After being shown sheep-shearing, a prize bull, and a foal named Fairywood Thumbelina, Mrs May met farmers to discuss Brexit.Addressing the meeting, she said: It seems to me that what we have when we come out of the Common Agricultural Policy is an opportunity to determine what is going to be right for the United Kingdom, rather than being part of policy developed for a number of countries within the EU.”She added: Leaving the EU presents us with a unique opportunity to transform our food, farming and environmental policies so we can have a healthy and prosperous agricultural industry that is fit for the future, and helps us to leave the environment in a better place than we found it.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It causes skin to blister and burn if it is exposed to the slightest amount of UV light.Understandably getting on with daily routines had been a real struggle for Alex, 25.Every inch of his skin had to be covered to stop it from burning. To protect his face his mum, Anna, designed and made a thick visor from plastic that hung from a hat and covered his face – but it was incredibly hot and distorted his vision.As part of a new TV experiment airing tonight, Inventing the Impossible: The Big Life, three people with various medical conditions hope to have their world transformed by a group of inventors. Alex, who also has neurological complications which have led to hearing loss and learning difficulties says: I wish I could be like everyone else but I cant help not being that.Design engineer Zoe Laughlin was challenged with to come up with a better solution to Alexs large and clunky homemade visor.But because Alex is 10,000 times more sensitive to UV damage than a normal person - so much so that even on gloomy days, he can’t go out unprotected - the requirements were extensive.He has to check the lights in every room with a special UV protection device wherever he goes.Anna says: “While a normal person’s DNA repairs at a rate of 98 per cent, his repairs at just 3 per cent. So if I was to get cancer at 60, he’d be likely to get it at three.“The doctors told us we’d have to live by night and sleep by day. So for the first few years we lived with the curtains closed.“I’d sit inside every day and cry with him. And the rest of the world went on outside.“But doctors said he might die at three and I wanted to show him as much of the world as I could. I wasn’t prepared to lock him away.Using a UV testing meter and a UV light, the engineers set to work to test different materials to see what might work as a base material for a mask to protect Alexs skin.Glass, snorkel masks and plastic all proved too weak and let UV rays through - which would cause Alex to burn.It turns out that Zoes moment of inspiration occurred while on a spa break.After trying a peel-off mask, the lead engineer tracked down a prosthetics company to see if they could make a UV protecting mask - like that used in Ninteties hit film Mrs Doubtfire.The idea was that it would be a second skin, which Alex could put on whenever he wants to leave the house.The mask was made by taking a scan of the persons face using a flashing light camera that takes thousands and thousands of pictures per seconds. The code of these photos is then sent to a computer and a 3D mask is created in the right proportions for the customers face.She finds a special kind of silicone that has 100 per cent UV protection.Dubious at first, Alex agrees to let Zoe and the other engineers go ahead and make the mask for him and undergoes a 3D body scan. It creates a lifelike 3D model of him which is then printed and cast back in the workshop.Using a bed of polymer powder, they print an exact model of Alex that will form the basis of the mask. A mould is then filled with the silicone.The mask took more than 300 painstaking hours to create - but once it is ready, Zoe takes the finished piece - complete with artificial stubble and hair - to Alex.Clearly unsure and shocked, the 25-year-old agrees to try it on, admitting hes blown away by the similarity between his face and the masks.Anna says: Im so glad they tried something that hasnt been done before. I just didnt think that you could do it. Theres a lot of work gone into it.Trying it on, Alex is speechless.Its so much more comfortable, he finally says, walking round in the mask of his own face.Without hesitating, Alex takes his first steps outside in his new mask.His mum, clearly emotional, say: Ive never seen Alex like this in my life.Alex hasnt been out like this, in broad daylight, at midday, ever, Anna says. Its a whole new world of potential."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000422867088.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lucky passenger gets a 168 seat boeing to himself for flight home from corfu","story":"Cabin crew attempted a synchronised safety demonstration and took selfies with Saad Jilani on his way home from a wedding on 21 July.The 28-year-old got a pick of 168 seats on the brand new Boeing 738 on the Jet2Airways 2am service to Birmingham.In one video Saad captured himself boarding the plane to be greeted by four members of cabin crew who were waiting for him outside the jet after he was taken by car from the gate to the plane.They welcomed him, saying: “Welcome aboard your private jet sir”.He also took snaps of him at the controls of the plane, grinning in the cockpit with the pilot on the two and a half hour flight.Another video shows the cabin crew attempt to give him a personal synchronised safety demonstration, showing the empty seats behind them.They pouted together to show off the empty seats and red lighting in the brand new plane.Saad didn’t have to worry about leg room as he stretched out at the front of the plane and avoided screeching infants which left him able to snooze comfortably.He said: “The staff was amazing and very excited that I was the only person on the plane with them.“Even though it was just me and them they were professional but we did have a laugh and a joke and it was brilliant.“I had been at a friend’s wedding in Greece, and I think there was meant to be one other person booked on my flight.“It’s a new route that they are doing so not a lot of people would have known about it yet.“When I was at the airport the members of staff came up to me and told me that I was the only person booked onto the flight.“I was really excited and I got the full private jet experience. The staff were young and laughing and joking with me.“We took photographs together and they basically let me have the run of the plane it was amazing.“There was food and drink if I wanted it, they let me take videos of the experience and sitting in the cockpit was brilliant as well.“Everyone was as excited as me to have only one passenger on the plane and movies and music were played over the PA system for all of us to enjoy.“We were having fun and it was the best flight that I have ever been on!”He added that he had no idea he was the only passenger on the plane until he reached the boarding gate and laughing staff told him he would be flying solo.And to finish off an “amazing” flight, on request the pilot announced ‘the eagle has landed’ upon touching down in the UK.Saad also got a free £60 voucher to use on his next holiday with jet2, after only paying £40 for the initial flight.A Jet2 spokeswoman said: “We were delighted to launch our first ever flight to Corfu from Birmingham on 21st July, which was full of happy holidaymakers.“As it was our first time operating this new route, there were fewer returning holidaymakers which meant that Saad got to experience our VIP customer service in style, on board one of our brand new aircraft.”Last month pals Yvette Francis and Peaches Murray were upgraded to business class when they were the only passengers on a flight to New York and washed down champagne and cocktails for free.In January Beth VerSteeg was the only passenger on a one-hour flight from Rochester, New York, to Washington DC.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The risk of extreme heatwaves is increasing rapidly worldwide due to greenhouse gas emissions.“This summer we are seeing an expression of that increased risk. It’s human-induced climate change that has made such a situation as we’ve seen in 2018 more likely.” The current heatwave began on June 24 and is the longest since the drought of 1976.Widespread thunderstorms, showers and even hail storms are predicted for today, but the ­sweltering heat is then expected to return.Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns the ground in North West London, said visitors to the pavilion would be spared during the heatwave.The club tweeted: “This applies to members and their guests.”Normal rules state that men visiting the pavilion on match days must wear lounge suits or tailored blazer and trousers.

In 2015 his security cost £3.2million.Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg also has a security programme which amounted to £2million last year, a fraction of Zuckerbergs £5.5million in 2017 – which is equivalent to £15,250 spent a day, according to CNBC.The network also reported that Zuckerberg has a team of 16 guards working security in rotation at his home in Palo Alto, California.Zuckerbergs security budget is massive compared to other company CEOs.Amazons Jeff Bezos spent £1.2million on security in 2016, for example, while Apples Tim Cook paid just £170,800 in 2016.Warren Buffett also allocated £295,000 for personal protection in 2016.The filing announcing Zuckerberg’s new security budget said: “The Committee believes that this allowance, together with the costs of Mr. Zuckerbergs existing overall security program, are appropriate and necessary under the circumstances.”The cash boost came on the same day that the social network’s market value plunged by £11.5billion.Thursday marked Facebook’s worst day in six years as a public company. It was also the biggest one-day wipeout in US stock market history.The Facebook founders net worth is now valued at £56billion, dropping him to the fifth richest person in the world.Facebooks shares plunged 22 per cent to £151.19 after it failed to meet Wall Streets estimates for user growth and quarterly revenue.Zuckerberg said Facebook had lost a million monthly active users in Europe for the first time following the introduction of GDPR rules from the European Union this year.However, the company announced their monthly active users rose to 2.23 billion, but still fell short of a consensus estimate of 2.25 billion from Thomson Reuters.Shares in Facebook, which have risen about 23 percent this year, fell 22 per cent to £151.19 in trading after the bell as investors reacted to the results.The Cambridge Analytica scandal prompted several apologies from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and generated calls for users to desert Facebook earlier this year.Prior to the announcement, it was predicted that the number of active users visiting the social network site across Europe would drop or flat line.Stockholders are blaming the entrepreneur after the social network became embroiled in a data scandal affecting millions of users.Trillium Asset Management, an investment company who own around £8.4million in Facebook stock, filed a proposal on Wednesday to split Zuckerbergs role as both chairman and CEO, Business Insider reported.They argued that shareholders were unable to check the founders power because he owns 60 per cent of the company and occupies the two highest positions.The proposal states: A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the boards oversight of management.Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.GDPR states that companies must request consent from their users to access personal data for advertising purposes, and companies that do not comply can face a fine.To be GDPR-compliant, Facebook rolled out a security check to users which asked them to review the personal information they consented to sharing for targeted advertising, as well as being asked to consent to facial recognition.But some analysts believe users may have been scared off by the explicit details about how their data is being used by the social network.The company is likely to become significantly more expensive to run with Zuckerberg announcing it was planning on hiring 20,000 people by the end of the year to boost its security and help review suspect content on the site."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423208373.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ibiza tourists receipt drinks charge san antonio bar","story":"The holidaymakers say they were fleeced by Eloisa Tapas \u0026amp Copas bar in San Antonio.They uploaded a photo of their bill to social media, which shows that two Coca Colas and two Sprites cost 52 euros.The image was accompanied by the message: Hello to all those people considering a holiday in Ibiza this year.This post was shared by nearly 6,000 people and attracted 1,200 comments.Netizen Javier Sanz said: My God, and you do not even get a paella aperitif?

Kate Hoey\u0027s delegates voted unanimously for a call to oust her last night in a damning motion that accused her of ignoring constituents\u0027 views, collaborating with Hard Brexit Tories and colluding with Nigel Farage. About 70 members, 45 with voting rights, packed into a baking hot community centre last night for a two-hour meeting of the Vauxhall Labour Party. The local party chair said not a single attendee spoke out to defend Ms Hoey. Only three delegates abstained in the no confidence vote - with none voting against. Local activist Jamie Green said one speaker declared: In the name of God, go. A source said members were despairing and at the end of their tether and the debate was about the best way to censure her or oppose her, rather than whether or not we should.  It must have been 40 degrees in there because the doors were jammed shut and the windows only opened about 5cm. Everyone was screwing up their bits of paper and making fans, they added. The motion has no legal effect but is designed to pile political pressure on Ms Hoey and party HQ. Members should also have the chance to deselect Ms Hoey using the \u0027trigger ballot\u0027 system at some point before the next general election. The local party has already requested a trigger ballot. A source said: I don\u0027t see how she would win a trigger ballot now.  Defiant Ms Hoey told the Mirror today: A vote of the local party is not the national executive, and local activists don’t necessarily speak for Labour supporters in Vauxhall. I will always put my country before my party and helping constituents is a priority. So quite relaxed and after 29 years as an MP have seen it all before. Ms Hoey is a veteran MP who backed Jeremy Corbyn to stay in power and has represented the south London seat for 29 years.  Yet she backs Brexit despite her wider area, Lambeth, voting 79% for Remain. She and three other Labour MPs voted recently with Tories against a bid to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s Customs Union - allowing it to lose by six votes. A source said Momentum and centrist members united against their MP last night. One ward put forward a motion against Ms Hoey - which other members then amended to make even more hard-hitting. In the final move, the words no confidence were then added on top of the newer, hard-hitting motion. The motion accused Ms Hoey of repeatedly reneging” on Labour’s manifesto with actions that cannot be deemed to be compatible with Labour’s core beliefs and values.”   It added: Examples of this go far beyond her views on EU membership. [They] include: Working for Boris Johnson when he was London Mayor chairing the Countryside Alliance and supporting fox hunting, despite representing an inner city constituency. Supporting elitist grammar schools attacking Labour’s ban on hand guns following the Dunblane massacre. Colluding with Nigel Farage, UKIP and the leave.eu campaign during the referendum - and accepting funds from Leave.EU tycoon Arron Banks.

Each of the destitute ‘Blanketeers’ carried a blanket, to show they were textile workers and to sleep in during their wintry journey. They also carried a letter to the Prince Regent. “We will let them see it is not riot and disturbance we want,” the \u0026shyLancashire reformer Samuel \u0026shyDrummond told the crowds. “It is bread we want, and we will apply to our noble Prince as a child would to its Father for bread.” Beaten back by the King’s Dragoon Guards, the Blanketeers were the forerunners of the tens of thousands who gathered at St Peter’s Fields two years later, only to be charged by cavalry. On that hot August day in 1819 – a turning point in Britain’s social history that is the subject of Mike Leigh’s latest film Peterloo – 15 people including a young child died, and up to 700 people were injured.  On Sunday, three artists from Manchester will follow the Blanketeers’ route to London, carrying blankets made by Lauren Sagar, 59, an award-winning artist. For Sagar, and her fellow travellers – Eve Robertson, 41, an actor and director, and John-Paul Brown, 36, a photographer and sculptor – their modern-day march is about the pain of austerity and the way gentrification drives artists and working class people out of cities. “The story of the Blanketeers seems to be fairly unknown, even to people who know about The Peterloo Massacre,” Sagar says. “They were self-employed spinners and weavers facing the loss of their jobs and poor working conditions. They were destitute. “They each carried a small piece of the petition for the Prince Regent, which they planned to put together when they got there. As soon as they set off, they were read the Riot Act and faced violence and intimidation. One man was killed and the story has it that only one man, Abel Cauldwell, made it to London. When I read about it I was inspired by their bravery, walking into the unknown, people who might not have left home before. “They wanted to let people know what was happening and the importance of that story really struck me. Blankets are something we all need, something basic and fundamentally human, and like the original Blanketeers, we’ll carry ones, created by me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"poll shows majority now back","story":"NewsPoll shows a majority now back a second referendum on BrexitThe YouGov survey claims to show a powerful surge in support for a fresh public vote on Brexit as fear mounts over the prospect of No DealShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByDan BloomPolitical reporter10:24, 27 JUL 2018Updated10:39, 27 JUL 2018NewsThe survey claims to show a powerful surge in support for a fresh public vote on Brexit (Image: Simon Dawson)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A majority of those who\u0027ve made up their mind now back a second EU referendum , a new poll claims today.

The polling giant quizzed 1,653 British adults on July 25-26, after the government announced it is ramping up plans for a no deal Brexit. Some 42% said there should be a second referendum on the terms of Theresa May\u0027s final deal with Brussels. 40% said there should not. This was a reversal of the 40% for and 42% against measured just a week earlier. But the country is still deeply divided, the poll suggested. Asked how they\u0027d vote in a re-run of the 2016 EU referendum, 45% said they would choose to remain in the EU while 42% said they would vote to leave.  Two-thirds of previous Remain voters (66%) said there should be a new referendum, but two-thirds of Leave voters (66%) said there should not. It comes as anti-Brexit campaigners ramp up their bid for a second referendum, with 250,000 signing a petition in 36 hours and the bid being backed by Tory and Labour MPs and Gary Lineker. Eloise Todd, chief executive of pro-EU group Best for Britain, claimed the sands of public opinion have shifted against Brexit. She added: The public are becoming increasingly restless. They don\u0027t want a shoddy deal full of second-rate concessions, or a nightmare no deal. It comes as Theresa May holds Brexit talks with her Austrian and Czech counterparts today as the clock ticks down to a deadline in October.   The Prime Minister is still trying to breathe life into her customs plan despite it being flatly rejected by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier last night.  Experts today also warned the plan could scupper Britain\u0027s bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. The government has not ruled out stockpiling food if there\u0027s no deal, with Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab indicating private firms could take the drastic measure. In July 2018, Theresa May announced a major shift to soft Brexit at Chequers - prompting Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The \u0027Facilitated Customs Arrangement\u0027 would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers were enraged, saying this olive branch will be useless in practice. Amid mass resignations, they forced Theresa May to pass a law which will make her plan illegal - unless the EU also collects tariffs on the UK\u0027s behalf. Mrs May insisted this doesn\u0027t scupper her plan. But in a major blow, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and said it does. Meanwhile Remainers and Labour also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds. That has left the plan opposed by all sides. With an October deadline looming, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March 2019 with no deal. But the idea was branded ridiculous today by supermarket chiefs who said it was simply not possible. One supermarket executive told the Financial Times: “It’s scary because it shows how far the government is from the reality of how things work. It’s genuinely worrying.” The British Retail Consortium added: Stockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit, and industry has not been approached by government to begin planning for this.

Each morning waking up to see complaints over her Brexit strategy, or a new plot by Boris Johnson to topple her leadership - the days must just merge into one. But we didn\u0027t expect the YEARS to merge into one. You see, Mrs May\u0027s summer holiday plans have been revealed ... and they look almost identical to the break she took last year. Downing Street have confirmed the Prime Minister will spend some time in Italy, before returning to the UK for a few days and attending a First World War memorial event in Amiens. She will then head to Switzerland. Last year, Mrs May and husband Philip enjoyed five days in a luxury hotel on the banks of Lake Garda in Northern Italy.  She then returned to Downing Street before attending commemorations of the centenary of the battle of Passchendaele in Belgium. After that she departed to Switzerland for a fortnight of walking in the Alps. Mrs May is expected to travel to Italy on Sunday.  MPs will at least be relieved she\u0027s not going walking in Wales, where she dreamed up the disastrous idea of a snap general election last year. Mrs May uses walking to unwind and think.

He wants to scrap or amend an obscure part of the party’s constitution which states only an MP can take the helm. The move, which is likely to be put to the party after summer recess and could be debated at the annual conference in Brighton in September, would mean a non-politician could become leader, scuppering ambitions of Sir Vince’s rivals on the Commons’ benches.  One potential name in the frame is campaigner Gina Miller, who took the Government to court over Brexit last year. The party, which has just 12 MPs, was mocked last week after Sir Vince and former leader Tim Farron skipped a crucial Brexit vote - despite fighting to keep Britain inside the EU. There has been growing unease among Lib Dems at Westminster and in the grassroots since Sir Vince became party chief last summer. Some insiders believe the plan to overhaul the rules about who can lead them is designed to curb a challenge from one of the MPs. However, a Lib Dem source said any plan to reform the leadership rules actually opens him up to far more challenges while not restricting the likelihood of MPs doing so. Former Business Minister Jo Swinson, who is currently on maternity leave, has previously been tipped as a future leader. And amid claims some party loyalists want to “skip a generation”, attention has also focused on rising star Layla Moran, the Lib Dems’ education spokeswoman.  Last week it emerged a former advisor to Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, Tom Pitfield, was advising Sir Vince on how to boost the Lib Dems’ appeal. It is thought one suggestion could be opening up the leadership to someone from outside political life. “In Canada, which is quite similar to the UK, the centre-left party was in terrible trouble despite having been in government, and they thought about how to get back to where they were,” Sir Vince told Business Insider. “Essentially, they decided it was about opening the doors, ceasing to be an inward-looking, membership club and broadening out.” But under current party rules, the leader can only be an MP.  Article 17.5 states: “Nominations must be of a Member of the Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons, who must be proposed by at least 10% of other members of the Parliamentary Party in the House of Commons and supported by 200 members in aggregate in not less than 20 Local Parties.” Blasting the plan, one senior Lib Dem source said: “This is a crackpot idea. “Vince has wanted this job for years and now he wants to plan to give it up with this harebrained scheme. “This is why he is so woefully out of his depth. “Just do your job and vote rather than plan the next leader of the party.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror tory boasts being","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Tory boasts of being the party of law and order look increasingly threadbareA combination of austerity and incompetence has left the prison and probation services on their knees and the latest statistics should be a matter of national shameShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByVoice of the Mirror00:12, 27 JUL 2018NewsopinionOne in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern” (Image: iStockphoto)Get politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tories used to boast they were the party of law and order. That claim looks increasingly threadbare given the current state of the justice system. A combination of austerity and incompetence has left the prison and probation services on their knees and the latest statistics should be a matter of national shame. Assaults on prison officers are at a record high, more than 15,000 mobile phones were found in England’s jails and drug abuse is rife. One in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern.”  If this were not bad enough, the Government is having to spend millions bailing out the privatised probation service. None of this should come as a surprise. When you cut thousands of prison staff, fail to tackle overcrowding and turn a blind eye to drug abuse, you create the appalling conditions we are now witnessing.

Evie-Beth Taylor was just five when she flummoxed doctors with chickenpox so bad they initially told her parents it might be a rare genetic disease and not the childhood disease at all. The infection was so severe the little girl was left screaming in pain whenever she was touched making it impossible for mum Lianne Taylor, 33, to clean her airways. So poorly she couldn\u0027t eat, drink or even use the toilet, poor Evie-Beth\u0027s nose became so clogged with \u0027rock hard\u0027 mucus that the little girl struggled to breathe. Lianne called paramedics and her poorly daughter was rushed to A\u0026ampE twice in just two days.  But Lianne claims she was \u0027treated like an over the top parent\u0027 and turned away both times, claiming she was told that she had to wait 10 days for the antibiotics prescribed by her GP to work. Desperate, Lianne took her daughter back to the GP once more who immediately arranged for her to go straight to hospital - where doctors told Lianne she was lucky to have brought her in when she did. After four days in hospital Evie-Beth was finally allowed to return home but it took months for the spots to completely go and has been left with scarring across her face and body. But now a year on, Lianne and Evie-Beth are bravely sharing the shocking images of her ordeal to raise awareness of just how serious chickenpox can be and tell other parents to seek help if concerned. Lianne, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, said: It was really traumatic seeing Evie-Beth like this.  She was struggling to breathe because she was so blocked up with mucus that went really hard. We couldn\u0027t get near her to wash her down or clean it away because she was screaming in pain. The spots just kept coming and coming. Even when she was in hospital the doctors were coming in every day and she was coming out with more and more spots. The doctors said they had never seen chickenpox that bad. They had a photographer come in and take photos of her skin because they had never seen a case as bad as hers before. They didn\u0027t know why. Mum-of-two Lianne first noticed a spot on her daughter\u0027s arm on February 4 2017 and thought it could be chickenpox. When the infection broke out in spots all over her body on February 8, her worried mum and dad Stuart Taylor bathed her in a bath with oats and rubbed her with creams and camomile lotions to ease the itch. But their daughter only got worse.  Lianne started sleeping in the same bed as little Evie-Beth so she could wake her up every hour to give her a drink. She was devastated when Evie-Beth only got more and more lethargic and eventually had to be carried and held over the toilet because her spots were too painful for her to even sit. Her GP prescribed her with antibiotics - but when paramedics took Evie-Beth to A and E on Feb 10 they turned her away then and on Feb 11 and told Lianne to wait 10 days for them to take effect. It wasn\u0027t until her GP sent Evie-Beth straight to Darlington Memorial Hospital on February 13 that the little girl was finally admitted. Lianne, who studies history at Teesside University, said: It was absolutely awful. It was really bad. Being sent away from A and E made me feel like I was treated like an over the top parent. It made it feel like it was beyond me and I couldn\u0027t do this. This was beyond the help I could give her. She couldn\u0027t eat or drink, she just lay there. She was crying and moaning and every time she moved she screamed. I was having to sleep next to her every night and not having much sleep myself and having to set an alarm to wake myself up every hour to get some fluids in her throat and give her paracetamol every four hours. It was horrendous. It was a really tough time.  I took her in the car to the doctor\u0027s and it took the GP to see her in pain to phone A and E and get her straight in at Darlington Hospital. They said this is really bad, any later and it would have been a different situation. They took her bloods and put her in isolation. The consultant sat us down and said it might not be chickenpox but could be a very rare genetic disease. They were going to have to transfer her over to Durham hospital where they could test her for it. It was very worrying. We got her across to Durham where consultants came in confirmed it was chicken pox but they didn\u0027t know why it was so bad. She was severely dehydrated. She\u0027d lost loads of weight because she still wasn\u0027t eating, and she would go to the toilet in a bedpan because we couldn\u0027t get her to the toilet. The doctors gave her some antiviral medication on a drip. Eventually, she did have to go on to normal painkillers. They were coming and checking her vitals all the time. I slept in a room with her for those days when she was really bad. The hospital staff were fantastic though and got her a TV and DVD player and toys for her to play with when she was feeling a bit better.

It\u0027s actually the most likely time of the year that your vehicle will run into problems. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to prevent a problem before it occurs. Below we\u0027ve pulled together everything you need to know to try and get around some of the most common issues, from where not to drive to what you need to check today.  We already know that summer can cause problems with your car battery , sapping it of essential fluids and running performance into the ground.   But you can get that checked with a Halfords Car Battery Fitting Service where in-store experts can fit a new one if necessary, with prices for a Halfords Car Battery starting at \u0026pound58.   When am I most likely to break down?    Department for Transport figures have revealed that in 2016, August was the peak month for breakdown incidents, with 17,777 cars needing the help of a breakdown service.  In the years, 2014 and 2015, July was the peak month, with 20,129 and 18,588 incidents recorded. The figures also reveal that Friday is the day most cars end up on the hard shoulder of England\u0027s motorways. And while the month varies across years, Friday was a constant in being the day most likely for cars to breakdown.  Which road is a breakdown blackspot?  The M1 is the undisputed leader in breakdowns. Between 2014 and 2016 there were 78,672 reported incidents. The M25 was a close second (71,933 breakdowns) and the M6 third (71,134 incidents).   One way that you can avoid additional stress on your engine (not to mention delays), is by avoiding heavy traffic. Using a sat nav like the Garmin Drive 51LMT-S with UK and Ireland Maps 5 Sat Nav - now \u0026pound88 (save \u0026pound31.99) is a great way to prevent hitting jams as it offers alerts when there are delays on your route.   Pair it with a dashcam to film everything that happens in front of you on the road - such as the Nextbase Dashcam 412GW , now \u0026pound103 (save \u0026pound26). You might find this gives you additional piece of mind. The device boasts QUAD HD 1440p High Definition recording at 30 frames per second to capture a 140\u0026deg viewing angle to capture the entire road ahead. This helps to provide you with instant evidence to support insurance claims in helping prove an accident was not your fault.   How to prevent a breakdown   A modern car is a marvel of engineering. For the most part you can be sure it will give you years of reliable service. However, your tyres, battery and engine oil levels should also be regularly checked. In the summer, engine oil gets hotter, making it less viscous. This can put a strain on the components in your engine and could lead to a serious problem.  Not having the right level of oil in your car will make this worse, so check regularly and top up with a good quality oil. Pop into a local Halfords store (no appointment needed), and trained experts will check your engine oil levels and top it up if needed. They can also advise on the best engine oil for your car.   Not everyone has the time to get under the bonnet, so a Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Gweneth Lee, 46, jetted off for a weekend in Paris in which she and her mystery man stayed at a \u0026pound15,000-a-night hotel, dined in a three-star Michelin restaurant and went on a \u0026pound17,000 shopping spree. The date culminated in the widow taking part in a \u0026pound10,000 Fifty Shades of Grey themed erotic photoshoot alongside the city\u0027s most famous landmarks including the Pont Alexandre III bridge and the Eiffel Tower.   Hotel guest BITES bridegroom after claiming someone from wedding was romping with his girlfriend behind door  Businesswoman Ms Lee, of Chelsea, West London said: My lover is like a real-life Christian Grey with a string of businesses ranging from tech to property. But he is real interest is sex and the kind of kinky games that Christian enjoys in the Fifty Shades of Grey books and films. He loves erotic imagery and it was his idea to hire one of Paris\u0027s finest erotic photographers for the shoot. We went from landmark to landmark and my lover choreographed all the shots.   Charles Bronson\u0027s wife says she\u0027s eating humble pie about divorce after notorious inmate releases statement  My favourite is the one next to the famous Pont Alexandre III bridge that crosses the Seine connecting the Champs-Elysees with the Eiffel Tower. It is one of the most romantic locations in the world but also highly erotic. We went straight back to the Ritz afterwards and made love while we chose the most smouldering shots for the shoot. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life.  Ms Lee has been dubbed Britain\u0027s most prolific mistress after dating at least 100 married men who treat her to expensive holidays all over the world. She got a taste for the high-life when she was married to her late oil executive husband Robert, who died from cancer ten years ago.  They were both having affairs on IllicitEncounters - a dating website for married people - and she simply carried on using the same site to meet more lovers after his death.  She says she prefers dating married men because they are wealthy and they just want no-strings fun and sex. During her weekend away in Paris, she was taken to the city by private jet and stayed in the \u0026pound15,000-a-night Imperial Suite at the Ritz Hotel. The couple dined at the three-Michelin starred Arpege restaurant where their dinner for two was \u0026pound4,000 due to the champagne they consumed. Other treats in the Paris weekend included a \u0026pound10,000 shopping trip to the Dior boutique in Avenue Montaigne and \u0026pound3,000-worth of erotic lingerie from the Carine Gilson boutique in Rue de Grenelle.  Ms Lee added: The trip to Paris was \u0027Christian\u0027s\u0027 little to treat for me to celebrate five years of dating. He lives in London and has a fairly detached relationship from his wife who is busy bringing up their two teenage children and doesn\u0027t share her husband\u0027s love of the kinky stuff. She is French and accepts that he will have affairs as long as they don\u0027t interfere with family life and I am one of several women he sees. I know one of his other lovers, a beautiful PA in her late 20s, because our dates overlapped once and he introduced us. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life. It was a weekend I will never forget where no expense was spared to ensure we had the time of our lives. The highlight was the unforgettable photoshoot in many of the most famous locations in Paris shot by Santillo, who specialises in the finest erotic photography. The only way we were able to do it was getting up at dawn so we got the very best light and could shoot without being swamped by tourists and over-inquisitive gendarmes.  Miss Lee and her lover travelled to the \u0027date\u0027 on his private jet. She said: People boast about turning only want to \u0027turn left\u0027 when they fly, meaning walking to the first class seats. But that is nothing compared to a travelling by private jet. My lover goes everywhere on his, even taking his beloved black labrador dog with him. Thankfully the dog skipped the trip to Paris but he\u0027s flown with us on other trips. You can join the Mile High Club any time you like on a private jet and not worry about the air stewards banging on the door.

Fire crews are dealing with the bolt strikes at four houses in North Yorkshire. A thunderstorm warning is in place for ten hours from 2pm today. There are severe rail delays around York due to a lightning strike at the station. Northern Rail have warned all lines are blocked between Leeds and York and advised customers in the area not to travel. The warm weather has led to storm conditions for millions with rolling thunder and flashes of lightning reported by thousands.        A house in Nottinghamshire is said to be \u0027well alight\u0027 due to the severe weather. Firefighters are still at the scene in Langold, Nottinghamshire while the fire service reports that occupants had closed a door where the fire started - allowing them to escape. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue tweeted : Crews from @HarworthFire and Worksop are still on the scene. Fortunately, the occupant had closed the door of the room where the fire started. This helped stop the spread of the fire and allowed them to get out.    Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-30s for much of east and south east England, reaching an estimated 37C in London on what has been called \u0027Furnace Friday\u0027. There is even a chance the mercury could beat the all-time UK record of 38.5C set in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. The BBC Weather Centre said this morning that storms which broke out overnight in north east England and eastern Scotland have dampened chances of a record-breaking day today.

UK heatwave in 1976: What Britain looked like the last time we broke records Outbreaks of rain and strong winds are expected to arrive from the southwest through Sunday, before clearing away to the east on Monday. Low pressure will be waiting in the wings on Sunday and this will strengthen the winds, with a chance of gale force gusts in exposed areas.     Worst of the weather will be in Ireland, Wales and southwest England, but it will be drier and bright after the rain has passed through. Temperatures will peak at just 17C in Scotland and nudge 20C in the south.  It will remain cloudy and wet in the northwest on Monday with some heavy showers. Temperatures will rise quickly in the south and Midlands, despite the unsettled conditions, with highs of around 27C. It will be slightly cooler elsewhere.

The repatriation of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War was one of the agreements reached during an unprecedented summit between the Trump and Kim Jong-un on June 12, and will be seen as a modest diplomatic coup for U.S. Today, (Kim) is fulfilling part of the commitment he made to the President to return our fallen American service members. We are encouraged by North Korea\u0027s actions and the momentum for positive change, the White House said in a statement. A U.S. military transport plane flew to an airfield in North Korea\u0027s northeastern city of Wonsan to bring the remains to Osan air base in South Korea, the statement said.  A formal repatriation ceremony would be held at Osan on Wednesday, it said. The transfer of the remains coincided with the 65th anniversary of the 1953 armistice agreement that ended fighting, although the two Koreas are technically still at war because a peace treaty was never signed. The pledge to transfer war remains was seen as a goodwill gesture by Kim at the June summit and, while it has taken longer than some U.S. officials had hoped, the handover will rekindle hopes for progress in nuclear talks.  Kim committed in a broad summit statement to work toward denuclearization but Pyongyang has offered no details about how it might go about this. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the return of the remains could boost the momentum for the nuclear talks between Pyongyang and Washington. More than 7,700 U.S. troops who fought in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, with about 5,300 of those lost in what is now North Korea.   North Korea still making atomic bomb fuel despite Kim Jong-un\u0027s promise to Donald Trump to denuclearise  The move comes at a critical time as the US tries to persuade North Korea to continue down the path of denuclearisation. Earlier this week US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said United States was engaged in patient diplomacy to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, but would not let the process drag out to no end during a Senate Foreign Relations Comittee.

Social media have heaped praise on the five-year-old girl - calling her stunning and a living doll after a professional photographer shared her portrait. Last Friday, photographer Mofe Bamuyiwa posted three photos of the young girl named Jare, saying: “Oh yes she’s human! She’s also an angel! and children are a gift from heaven. The little girl shows no hint of shyness in the distinctive portraits where she looks straight into the camera and shows off her skillful poses.  Fans gushed over the images on Instagram commenting simply gorgeous, soo beautiful and absolutely stunning. Mofe reportedly works as a lifestyle and wedding photographer in Lagos, Nigeria. Despite Jare\u0027s obvious confidence Mofe told Yahoo Lifestyle: “Jare isn’t a professional model.  She has two sisters - Jomi, 7, and Joba, 10 - who also model and have their own instagram page. Although not everyone was a fan. Some people couldn\u0027t believe the images were real and asked if photoshop was used or the girl was given a wig. Jare isn\u0027t the first girl to take Instagram by storm at such a young age. French supermodel and actress Thylane Blondeau, 17, first made a name for herself at just four years old modelling for Jean Paul Gaultier.   Two years later, aged six, she graced the page of fashion-bible vogue and her blond her and blue eyes made her a global superstar.  The photo earned her the original title of the \u0027most beautiful girl in the world\u0027 and she is now a regular on runways across the world. Meanwhile, six-year-old Anna Knyazeva, from Russia, has attracted over 1.2 million fans on Instagram thanks to her model-looks.

He has fantastic pace and loves to run at defences. He is strong on both feet, and I believe he will excite our fans,” said Csaba.After an unsuccessful spell in the Turkish second tier, Loemba is keen to get going in Scottish football.“I am happy to be with Dundee United, I am excited to play in Scotland and want to bring joy to our fans,” he said.Vastic comes in as United look to complete the final part of their rebuilding process since the end of last season.While Csaba is pleased to have secured the services of strikers Nicky Clark and Craig Curran earlier in the summer, he wants more height in his attack. At well over six feet, the former Blackburn and Bayern Munich kid fits the bill on that score.And, over the next few days, the coaching staff will see if he is up to scratch in terms of his all-round striking ability.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united hand trial to former bayern munich and blackburn rovers star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo will have a look a player with a strong football pedigree as he tries to add to his attacking options at Dundee United.Today will see Austria Vienna reserve striker Toni Vastic arrive for a trial with the Tangerines.Now 25, Vastic spent time with both Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich’s second team in his younger days and also has experience of top flight football in his native Austria.And his father Ivica, though born in Croatia, won 50 caps for Austria between 1996 and 2008 as well as starring for the likes of Strum Graz and Austria Vienna, for whom he is now a youth coach.Csaba did not confirm Vastic is the player he was bringing over but did concede it was a striker from Vienna who is strong in the air and there is no doubt Vastic is that man.It was through the manager’s contacts in central Europe that the deal to bring him over for a tryout was done.“We are working to bring players in.

The 3D Festival on Saturday is free and not ticketed, giving everyone the chance to get involved in the celebrations.“People will have a full two weeks to enter the ballot. Tickets will be allocated at the end of the ballot period.“We want to ensure a fair balance of access across all our audiences.“By using a ballot system we are able to ensure a high proportion of tickets go to our locally-based audiences and young people.“The ballot system ensures that at least 55% of tickets for the Friday 3D Festival go to local audiences, resident in DD postcode areas.“We will also be distributing tickets through the city’s community engagement network and Young Scot networks.“All 3D Festival tickets are non-transferable and will be allocated following a postcode ballot, with a maximum of four tickets per person.“To help prevent tickets being sold on, a confirmation message will be sent shortly after the ballot closes, but tickets will not be issued until a week before the event.”Speaking exclusively to the Tele, the Be Charlotte singer – real name Charlotte Brimner – said: “I honestly can’t wait for it, it’s going to be amazing. It’s so exciting to be asked to play for such a big event in Dundee and for such a historic thing like the opening of the V\u0026ampA.“It’s a really exciting time to be in Dundee and I’m just so glad to have been asked to perform.“The last time I performed here was when I was at Carnival Fifty Six which was amazing, it was such a good day and hopefully it’ll be the same again.“Since then I’ve been working on a lot more songs and I hope to have some new music to play when the show comes around.”The ex-Morgan Academy pupil, 21, was recently snapped up by Columbia/Sony Music who represent global superstars Adele and Beyonce.She added: “Since I’ve been signed it’s been great working with new people and to have that support from a major label has been incredible.“I could never really imagine that would happen.“I’ve been doing a lot of different gigs in Scotland and I’ll be looking to go back into the studio. I think it’s because I’ve grown up in and around Dundee, a lot of my songs are about the city.“So it’s all come together quite well considering I’ve been performing and writing these songs at the same time as the city has been changing.”Primal Scream will unveil a new collaboration with Turner Prize-nominee Jim Lambie for their performance.Other acts set to perform alongside Be Charlotte on Friday include Scots singer Tallia Storm, Dundee dance company Shaper/Caper and techno DJ Eclair Fifi.Saturday will see Dundee musicians St Martiins, Kashmi Crows and Andrew Wasylyk take to the stage.Family design workshops will be led by Abertay University with Beano Studios creating a special edition comic available to those attending the festival.Visit vandadundee.org for more information.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/PA-36925668.jpg ","title":"rita ora in dundee all you need to know about road closures and diversions for gig","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDiversions have been outlined for Saturday night’s Rita Ora concert in Slessor Gardens.Key roads have been closed off around the area, including Shore Terrace to the rear of Caird Hall, Thomson Avenue, South Crichton Street and South Castle Street.A number of Xplore Dundee bus services will also be diverted as a result from 2.45pm on Saturday.Services 5 and 9/9a will run via Hawkhill instead of Perth Road when heading for Ninewells, with a shuttle running from Nethergate to Perth Road to join up the journey.Service 17 will also run via Hawkhill, in both directions.Service 22 towards Craigowl will stop on Ward Road at the former Meadowside post office instead of Albert Square.Christine McGlasson, managing director of Xplore Dundee, said: “We are urging everyone attending the concert to take the bus as this will be the quickest and easiest way to travel into the city centre and get home again after the party.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"stop gap medical centre approved for local area","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for a stop-gap surgery in the Carse of Gowrie area have been approved.The new unit will provide temporary accommodation for the Carse Medical Group after it was forced out of its main premises in Errol.As an emergency measure, the surgery has been operating from another base at St Madoes.Proposals to build the new surgery, on land to the south-west of Errol Airfield, were submitted to Perth and Kinross Council in April.Conservative councillor Angus Forbes said: “This is a turning point in the very long saga of this surgery which has been running for many years.”Labour councillor Alasdair Bailey said: “This is only a step along the way towards a permanent fit-for-purpose healthcare facility for the Carse.“I will continue to push for all options to be explored for the location of the permanent build.”The SNP’s Beth Pover added: “This is the first step to securing long-term, permanent and quality healthcare in the Carse of Gowrie.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

according to a trade union.The GMB represents most of the hospital\u0027 security staff.It has calculated the sum on the number of hours that high-ranking, highly paid NHS officials have dedicated to the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a reason is regularly given by public bodies when questioned about the use of staff time that is clearly beyond their regular, scheduled\u0026nbsp duties.The union has complained that morale among security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the security department was apparently prompted \"because an ex manager has the view that the guards don\u0026rsquot have enough work to do\".The GMB\u0027 regional officer Liz Gordon calculates that the process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of 22,000 steps per eight-hour shift \u0026ndash that\u0027 11 miles \u0026ndash and is often in crisis being reduced to single-man working.\"A spokeswoman for NHS Highland attempted to dismiss all the concerns.She said: \"Organisational change is managed within existing resources.\"Organisational change is ongoing in relation to security at Raigmore Hospital.\"The next meeting between management and union officials is scheduled for early August.Its aim, according to the board, is \"to allow those involved to bring together the work that\u0027 getting done in the background\".Scottish

red tape almost flattened Nairn sandcastle event","story":"A SANDCASTLE competition set up by a mum looking for free things to do with her child during the holidays was almost scuppered by council red tape.Nairn\u0027 Dawn Cowie-Mcinnes (41) was shocked to receive a letter from Highland Council warning her that she needed official permission to host the event on the town\u0027 beach.She feared there was no way she could complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission

answers","story":"\u0026nbspTHE public could be waiting until the beginning of next year to find out if the Loch Ness monster is really hiding below the depths.A collection of samples have now been taken from the murky waters of Loch Ness and sent to Hull so that the DNA can be extracted.It is all part of a Kiwi scientist\u0027 plan to finally answer the question of whether Nessie is real.Neil Gemmell, geneticist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand, visited the Highlands with a team of specialist scientists to collect the water samples in June.The Super Natural History Team will then study the samples in bases around the world for signs of DNA.Mr Gemmell is satisfied that the collection process went well.\"All is going to plan but it is too early for any results,\" he said.He believes it will be late in this year or the beginning of next before they have any revelations.Once the DNA has been extracted in Hull the samples will be sent on to France and Switzerland to get the sequence data \u0026ndash the digital breakdown of all the DNA found.\"From there the data goes all over the world,\" Mr Gemmell added.He has previously admitted that while he does not believe in the Loch Ness Monster he is \"open to the idea of something unusual living in the loch\".The team used specialist equipment and boats to take samples up to 200m below the surface.The research has reignited discussions within Scottish National Heritage (SNH) about what would happen if Nessie is found.\u0026nbsp In 2001, the organisation reacted to a period of peaked interest in the

Islands","story":"\u0026nbspA \u0026pound40,000 artwork which would enable children to paddle in and enjoy the water at the Ness Islands is the latest offering from the Inverness River Connections project.\u0026nbspIf approved by councillors, it will consist of patterned sculptural stepping stones made of granite, sitting in a stainless steel channel or lade.Water from the river will feed into this channel where some of the stones will be fitted with moveable sluice gates to allow children to control the flow of water themselves.The plan is for it to be located in the middle of the Ness Islands at a spot already popular with families.The proposal is just one element of the River Ness Public Art Project, worth a total of \u0026pound727,000.Inverness Provost Helen Carmichael was yesterday hopeful that the concept would find favour with councillors on Highland Council\u0027 south planning committee, especially since local schoolchildren had been consulted on what they would like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Friday 27 Jul 2018 11:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

As such, agricultural vehicles need to meet specific conditions to travel on the road.“The consequences of a special road designation were considered at a Public Local Inquiry in 2008.“The road has been progressed on the basis of the orders presented at the PLI.“One of these conditions prevents agricultural vehicles from travelling more than 1.5km between farm land, unless they are being used for horticultural purposes such as trimming verges.“We understand that this means that it is not possible to meet this distance criterion on the new road.“However, as strategic traffic will transfer from the existing road network to the AWPR, we expect to see significant journey time savings on local roads, generating significant benefits for agricultural use.”North-east Conservative MSP Peter Chapman has written to Transport Scotland about the issue.He said: “Farmers are up in arms about this. My view is that this road is not a motorway, it is a dual carriageway and therefore tractors should be permitted to travel along the route.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"clark lifts the pace as she zooms in on berlins championship relay","story":"\t\t\t\t\tZoey Clark is focused on helping Great Britain achieve more 4x400m relay success at next month’s European championships in Berlin after missing out on selection for the individual 400m event.The Aberdeen AAC runner set an impressive personal best time of 51.36sec in the Muller Games IAAF Diamond League meeting at the London Stadium on Sunday but it wasn’t quite enough to gain the third and final individual place on the team for Germany.Her time, the fifth best ever recorded by a Scot, was the same as that given to Amy Allcock (Aldershot Farnham and District) who was, however, judged to have been slightly ahead at the finish. Allcock, who also finished one place in front of Clark at the British championships earlier in the month, got the nod when the final team was announced. Anyika Onuora (Liverpool) and Laviai Nielsen (Enfield and Haringey) had been selected earlier.Clark has been included in a 10-strong 4x400m relay squad which also includes fellow Scots Eilidh Doyle (Pitreavie AC) and Kirsten McAsland (Sale Harriers).Clark said: “I was really pleased to knock 0.5sec off my previous best 400m time at London, but I guess I didn’t feel quite so good about it as I would normally because it wasn’t enough.“After that I knew I’d probably not be picked for the individual 400m so I have mixed feelings, but now I can concentrate on the relay.”The Aberdeen athlete has an impressive record when representing Great Britain in major international competitions over the past year.She was part of the 4x400m relay squad which won bronze at the 2017 world outdoor championships in London and took relay silver at the world indoors in Birmingham earlier this year.Clark also helped Scotland finish fifth in the 4x400m at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, setting a national record time of 3min 29.18secs.And earlier this month she was part of another GB quartet which took fifth position in the World Athletics Cup in London.Now she’s hoping to add to her honours in Germany, but admits she’s taking nothing for granted.She said: “We have a very strong relay squad as seven or eight girls all achieved the individual qualifying standard for the 400.“There’s no doubt we could do some damage in Berlin.“GB always look for a medal in the 4\u0026#215400 and we will do our best to get gold, but there’s a lot of good teams out there.“France and Poland beat us at the World Cup earlier in the month, but we didn’t have our strongest team taking part.We won’t, however, be discounting them.“We just have to concentrate on putting in our best performances and we’ll see what happens.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out. I take the camera wherever I go. I always keep my eye open for the right shot. With a good camera you can’t go wrong.’One summer evening last year, Teenie said their neighbour Duncan Black, a retired seaman, had asked if she wanted to go fishing. ‘I was waiting for him to bring the boat in,’ she recalled. ‘I thought it would make a great shot. We caught 40 fish that night. When I downloaded it, I thought ‘wow’.’‘Wow’ indeed, because it was voted the best from hundreds of brilliant photographs sent in by you – you can still enjoy them all by visiting #myargyll.‘I am chuffed,’ Teenie said. ‘I am not very confident in my own work \u0026#8211 everybody tells me they are good. This has given me a huge boost.’Thanks to her winning photograph, Teenie has won an autumn break for two on Islay, featuring an overnight stay at the Machrie Hotel, dinner and B\u0026ampB in Bowmore’s Harbour Inn, a tour of Islay’s newest distillery, Ardnahoe, a boat trip with Islay Sea Adventures, travel via Hebridean Airways, based at Oban Airport, a night at the Falls of Lora Hotel in Connel, and an Oban walking tour.Teenie said: ‘I am taking my sister, because she persuaded me to enter the competition.’Teenie also runs the island’s photography club and has just been awarded £1,000 to set up a junior one this winter.The runner-up was Alan Frew from Helensburgh.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on

new historic landmarks in and around the Borders being identified from the air.\nCrop marks showing ancient settlements and Roman fortifications, which were otherwise hidden under the plough soil, are now being documented by Historic Environment Scotland following late June\u0027s and early July\u0027s drought.\nThe extensive marks form as the crops respond to dry conditions and have allowed the team to document known sites that have not been visible for many years.\nIron Age burials, Neolithic pits and prehistoric settlements are all marked out in the fields, against a backdrop of long-infilled rivers and streams which tell the story of Scotland\u0026rsquos landscape.\nAmong the sites identified during the HES aerial survey team are Iron Age souterrains in the Borders \u0026ndash a rare find in this part of Scotland \u0026ndash and a Roman temporary camp within the known complex of sites at Lyne near Peebles.\nDave Cowley, aerial survey project manager at Historic Environment Scotland, told us: \u0026ldquoAerial surveys of Scotland have been carried out since the 1930s, with each year usually adding a little more to the patchwork of our knowledge.\n\u0026ldquoWe depend on dry years to bring out the buried remains in the crops, so we are currently out hunting for new clues from the skies while the good weather lasts.\n\"The conditions this year are showing us many sites that we knew were there, but may not have seen in recent damp summers, as well as revealing new archaeological sites that add to our ability to see into the past to tell Scotland\u0026rsquos story.\nHistoric Environment Scotland\u0026rsquos aerial survey team has discovered and recorded more than 9,000 buried sites since it was formed.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"radical-plans-proposed-to-save-town-centres-across-the-borders","story":"THE plight of high streets across the Borders has been laid bare in a damning report on the region\u0026rsquos town centres.\nFootfall in Scottish Borders town centres has fallen dramatically over the last decade, and that has led to an increase in empty shop units.\nA report set to go before Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday outlines the challenges facing our town centres.\nIn Hawick, footfall has more than halved since 2007, and Selkirk and Duns have seen footfall reductions of 25% or more over that period.\nMelrose, Jedburgh, Galashiels and Peebles have all seen reductions of between 14 and 18%, but Kelso has managed to return its footfall numbers to 2007 levels following a slump in the interim.\nEmpty shop fronts are an increasingly common sight across the UK, and the Borders is no different. Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town. It is important to safeguard our heritage for future generations, and recognise the influential role the railway has played over the years.\nIf you would like to be involved in the project, contact PCT co-coordinator Alex Wilson at admin@peeblescommunity.org\n"},{"url":null,"title":"locals-saddle-up-for-newtown-st-boswells-farmers-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers \nShow\ntook place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.\nThe supreme winner of the show judged by Mr and Mrs Doddie Weir went to the hunter champion, the evergreen Fusilier, owned and ridden by Gillian McCowan.\nReserve supreme was Clive Storey\u0026rsquos Masquerade, who stood overall in the Coloured Section.\nDi and Joanna Walton judged the Ridden Hunters and their reserve was the runner up in the hunter class, Silver Dream Spirit, ridden by John Wilson from Selkirk.\nMorean Hamilton placed the In Hand Hunters and chose the winner of the two-year-old class as her Champion, West Country Lady Guinevere \u0026ndash a home bred filly owned by Sally Burns from Hawick.

well-drilled, energetic and highly skilledPollock U19s.The visiting team had enough potential to produce players for the higher echelons of the game in the not too distant future.Coached by our Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Stuart Crossan, the Glasgow side impressed with their quick possession football and a willingness to close space, during a frantic opening quarter of a highly entertaining match, at the wonderfully prepared Kintyre Park.The visitors immediately seized the initiative using the ball effortlessly as they imposed their own brand of football across the full width of the park.The Campbeltown favourites were in no mood to play second fiddle and, after adjusting to Pollock’s enthusiastic start, the Pupils created a number of opportunities as Souden and Barr tested the defence down the flanks.The Pupils midfield and central defence dug deep to rest the initiative from their stubborn opponents, but gradually the pendulum swung as the home side played their way into the match.It was a fascinating encounter between two well-matched sides, a game enjoyed by what was a sizable crowd for a friendly fixture.The partisan home support were soon on song when the mercurial Sary Rhama broke free behind Pollock\u0026#8217s defence, a fleeting glimpse of goal before he was unceremoniously brought down from behind.Taking the penalty kick himself, the Pupil’s striker drove the ball straight down the middle to give the home side a slender advantage with 29 minutes on the clock.The pace was unrelenting, and the visitors were rewarded when the Pupils failed to clear their lines from a corner.In the ensuing play, the ball was skilfully carried to the touchline, before an accurate cutback found the incoming forward who drove the ball home at the second attempt beyond Ferguson.One each at half-time was a fair reflection, with neither side gaining the ascendancy.Both sides made a raft of changes in the second period.Pupils ‘blooded’ seven graduates from the under-16s eleven during the game.Pick of the day was an acrobatic scissors clearance from young Ross Brown,  saving the situation with a last ditch goal line clearance.Shortly after, the home side raced up-field to claim victory with a fine goal from player of the match, Ryan McConnachie.Instrumental in both defence and attack, Ryan controlled the ball expertly in the box, deftly shifted its position, before stroking the ‘leather’ beyond a stranded goalkeeper for a brilliant winning goal.A top drawer finish if there ever was one!Tomorrow Campbeltown Pupils bring top quality opposition to Kintyre Park in the shape of Bridgewater, last season’s Scottish amateur cup semi- finalists.A tough match is in the offing, as Bridgewater  lost narrowly by 1-0 to the brilliant Goldenhill in the

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

A tribute on the Edinburgh RC website stated: \u0026ldquoEdinburgh RC would like to mark the life of former club member Ben Forsyth which sadly ended on July 1.  \u0026ldquoHe was a stalwart member of the youth section until he joined the Spokes race team in 2014.  \u0026ldquoThe pinnacle of his cycling achievements was winning the British youth circuit race championship in 2013 on the promenade at Blackpool in an ERC jersey.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

He told the Courier how the drastic change in career came about: \u0026ldquoWhen I was a PT people used to come to me and ask for a diet plan or a training plan.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod say \u0026lsquohave you had one of these before?\u0026rsquo and they\u0026rsquod tell me they\u0026rsquod had seven or eight.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

He said the United States treated Pakistan like a mercenary, giving it billions of dollars to fight the war on terrorism in a region beset with militant extremists.  \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, so far our relations were one-sided. America thinks that it gives Pakistan money to fight for them. Because of this Pakistan suffered a lot, said Mr Khan, who has been critical of the US-led conflict in neighbouring Afghanistan.  He offered nothing to suggest an improvement in Pakistan\u0026rsquos already testy relationship with Washington since president Donald Trump\u0026rsquos tweets in January that accused Islamabad of taking US aid and returning only lies and deceit.  He focused on what he wanted to do for the poor in Pakistan and his vision of a country that bowed to no one, where everyone was equal under the law and taxes were paid by the rich to fund services for the less fortunate.  His campaign message of a new Pakistan seemed to resonate with young voters in a country where 64 percent of its 200 million people are under 30.  Although rights groups and minorities expressed worries ahead of the voting about radical religious groups taking part, moderate voices seemed to have prevailed: none of the 265 candidates fielded by the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba won.  That includes the son of co-founder and US-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who has a 10 million US dollar bounty on his head.  The candidates campaigned under the little known Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek party because Lashkar-e-Taiba is banned.  However, analysts have expressed concern that disgruntled losers could create instability for the incoming government, which must deal with a crumbling economy, crippling debt and a raging militancy.  The voting was marred by a suicide bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, that killed 31 people as they waited to vote.  A bombing in the same province earlier this month killed 149 people, including a candidate for office.  The election marked only the second time in Pakistan\u0026rsquos 71-year history that one civilian government has handed power to another."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8127582.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"thousands-in-limbo-as-energy-supplier-iresa-ceases-trading","story":"  Sector watchdog Ofgem has said customers will continue to receive energy supplies as normal and that their outstanding credit balances would be protected under its safety net.

However, his former employers at BAE, which owns the yard, dropped the idea as the UK Government scaled back and slowed down a much-mooted order for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos next generation of frigates.  Now Mr Sweeney says new thinking on shipbuilding in Whitehall could see the structure built after all.  The MP - citing anonymous briefings - said the \u0026ldquoaspiration of officials would be to have two main UK production centres for fighting ships, each with a long-term commitment of orders.  The first such base would be the Clyde, which would be expected to churn out vessels - both complex Type 26 frigates already on order and a future replacement of T ype 45 destroyers - using the same basic hull.    Scotstoun yard where frigate factory was planned  Such a long-term commitment, he said, should enable BAE Systems to invest in the kind of covered dock hall where such vessels could be made away from Glasgow\u0026rsquos rain and wind for decades to come.  Mr Sweeney said: \u0026ldquoIt is important that BAE seeks that sort of long-term commitment from the MoD that would give it the confidence to look at investment in a facility like the so-called frigate factory.  A single factory - as opposed to the current arrangements across both the Scotstoun and Govan yards - should cut the unit costs of every ship it makes. It would also create new capacity on the Clyde for other work.  The MoD this week shelved a competition for another, cheaper kind of frigate, a type 31 for which the Upper Clyde yards cannot compete because of capacity issues.  Rival bids for this work - originally assumed to be heading to the Upper Clyde - would include potential multi-site manufacturing in England and Scotland.  Mr Sweeney said\u0026nbspType 31s could be made at sites such as Cammell Laird at Mersey or Rosyth on the Forth. Such vessels are designed for what the navy calls constabulary duties - fighting pirates or providing aid - rather than a full-on war with the navies of a modern state. But they nevertheless \u0026ldquopack a punch, said Mr Sweeney and have export potential.  But Type 31s may well end up being sold as \u0026ldquonearly new after a few years of service in the Royal Navy, meaning a buyer state would avoid any snagging issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat would maintain a constant production of the 31e. So the aspiration is to continuously produce two standard classes of ships for the Royal Navy.  Mr Sweeney, however, remains concerned that what he described as Tory \u0026ldquocutthroat competition for orders between yards would scupper a revival.    Paul Sweeney congratuled as he is elected in 2017  Britain currently has 19 major fighting ships. It needs 24 to meet its international and domestic commitments, according to current thinking.  BAE did not comment on whether it could renew its frigate factory plan. The company did, however, echo MOD messaging that Type 26 orders secured shipbuilding on the Clyde for 20 years."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook-releases-documents-revealing-scale-of-pro-brexit-social-media-ads","story":"  The details came as the social media giant saw more than \u0026pound80 billion wiped off the value of its shares amid a warning of slowing user and sales growth.  Nine of Vote Leave\u0026rsquos ads were viewed between two and five million times out of hundreds paid for by the pro-Brexit campaign, suggesting the group had paid significantly more to have the messaging appear more prominently in people\u0027s newsfeeds on Facebook.  Five of the nine Vote Leave adverts which, were viewed some two to five million times focused on immigration.  Of those, two identical adverts stressed plans for Turkey to join the EU with an image showing a large red arrow sweeping across Europe from Turkey to the UK.  The accompanying text read: \"The EU is expanding and plans on granting Turkey visa-free travel. This will put enormous pressure on the NHS, our border security and economy.  \"Have we lost control? We already send \u0026pound350 million to the EU every single week. Shouldn\u0027t we spend our money on our priorities instead? Vote Leave Day - Thursday 23 June. Is This Good News? Click No! Vote Leave.\"  At the time, negotiations for Turkey to join the EU had completed one of 35 \u0027chapters\u0027 of legislation and as a member the UK would be able to veto any plans.  Another popular advert claimed more than five million \"new immigrants\" were heading to the UK, the figure appears to be based on the highest possible projection of EU immigration to the UK by the Office for National Statistics at the time.  Three identical adverts which were seen by between two and five million people urged voters to \"spend our money on our priorities like the NHS\", citing the disputed figure of \u0026pound350m per week sent to the EU.  As one of the figureheads of the campaign, Boris Johnson featured heavily in many of the more widely-seen adverts.  In two, the former Foreign Secretary is quoted talking about immigration and in a third he is pictured in front of a Vote Leave lorry with a caption urging people to vote for Brexit.  Adverts ranged over a number of subjects from protecting polar bears to banning the sale of whale meat. Other messages accused the EU of wanting to \"ban tea kettles\" and \"kill our cuppa\".  Vote Leave paid for significantly more Facebook advertisements around the EU referendum than the other campaign groups in the documents released to a House of Commons committee inquiry into fake news.  However, one advert from BeLeave published the week before the referendum was seen by more than five million people, more than any other adverts released by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  It read: \"Being under EU rule is severely restricting our ability to grow and reach our full potential as a great nation. It is time we take a stand for Britain. Let\u0027s vote to leave the EU on 23 June so we can have a clear and prosperous future! BeLeave in Britain!

After a 17-year project to restore the jet-engined hydroplane after lifting in from the depths of Coniston Water in the Lake District, engineer Bill Smith will bring the Bluebird to the Isle of Bute for trials next week.  It is the first time the superspeed craft has been put back into action since it was raised in 2001, and more than half a century since Campbell\u0027s final, fatal attempt to break the world water speed record.  The daredevil, the only person to hold both the world land and water speed records simultaneously, lost his life on 4 January 1967 when the Bluebird crashed during his second attempt to break his own record, flipping over as it reached speeds of 320 mph and sinking beneath the waves.  The craft was eventually recovered in 2001, and it has taken almost 20 painstaking years and a small army of dedicated volunteers to restore the Bluebird to her former glory.    The Bluebirn in full flight on Coniston  From 4th to 16th August, the iconic craft will undertaking crew training on Bute\u0027s Loch Fad, although it will be moving at a considerably slower pace than it did in its creator\u0027s day.  Project leader Mr Smith has had a love of Bute since fishing trips as a teenager and then later as a diver. He said: \"Loch Fad is perfect for this crew-training exercise.  \"It\u0027s just long enough for Bluebird to get moving and just deep enough that it won\u0027t be too difficult for divers to retrieve any dropped tools.\"  \"It\u0027s pretty exciting for us right now because we\u0027ve just ground-tested Bluebird and all her systems are running beautifully. When she\u0027s put in the water at Loch Fad next week, it will be the first time in 50 years that Bluebird\u0027s engine will be started while afloat.\"  The bluebird suffered catastrophic damage in the crash which cost Campbell his life, and was hidden by the murky waters of Coniston for decades, although the location was pinpointed by a group of divers from the Royal marines shortly after the crash, but kept a secret.  When it was rediscovered by Mr Smith, there were moves to have it left in situ, but it was eventually raised to stop it becoming a magnet for souvenir hunters.  The body of Donald Campbell was located two months later, still in the green jumpsuit he wore during the final run. An inquest later found he had been decapitated by the Bluebird\u0027s plastic windshield.    Bill Smith with the wreck of the Bluebird  Mr Smith, said that there would be \"no goosebumps\" when he sees the famous hydroplane take to the water again.  Around a dozen different crew members will be required to get the Bluebird moving again, and it will be piloted by professional hydroplane pilot Ted Walsh.  The Bluebird was raised mostly intact, but the team were forced to start over again because the original structure was made half an inch adrift.  Companies in North Shields, where Mr Smith is based, also helped with its restoration. Rolls-Royce Controls and Data recreated the original 1967 fuel system from plans found in archives.  Mr Smith only plans to aim for speeds of around 65mph for demonstrations purposes.  He said: \"It\u0027s taken us 17 years to get to this point. But it\u0027s not the end of the journey. The trip to Scotland is get the crew prepared for the final trials we hope to do in Cumbria. It\u0027s another step in the road.\"  Mr Smith said that he fully expects things to go wrong during the trials. In fact, having everything be plain sailing would be counter to the way Donald Campbell approached his record-breaking runs.  He said: \"The Bluebird was always a work in progress and Campbell was always making changes to the design. If he hadn\u0027t crashed he would have been back for another go having made alterations and adaptions to the craft.  \"We\u0027ll have to fix little problems and hope that nothing major cocks up. There will be holes that need filed with silicon and bits that need fixed down, and lots of small snags to smooth over and get everything shipshape. But we\u0027re confident that the Bluebird will work as it should.\"    Campbell began started his career using his father\u0027s old boat, the Bluebird K4, but after a structural failure at 170 mph in 1951 he developed the Bluebird K7.  He championed British engineering his entire life and saw the Bluebird, and his land speed records, as a national foil to the feats of the space race being undertaken by the US and the USSR at the time.\u0026nbsp  He first broke the record in 1955 with a speed of 202mph.\u0026nbsp That rose to 260mph by 1959. By 1966, his record stood at 276mph.  Although he reached a speed more than 300mph in the fateful 1967 attempt he did not smash his previous record as he failed to complete the journey.    The fatal crash  Mr Smith believes that Campbell would by proud to see the Bluebird fly again, adding: \"Donald Campbell was a bit of a showman and he used to say that there\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity.  \"He talked a good job and did it very well at drumming up publicity. He would have loved this.\"  Mr Smith said: \"When we raised the Bluebird his wife, Tonia, was beside me on the boat and I looked over at the shoreline and there was 200 reporters and TV cameras and satellite trucks lines up.  \"I asked her \u0027do you think Donald would have liked this?\u0027, and she just laughed and said that he would have absolutely thrived on it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-brexit-customs-plan-could-create-1bn-smugglers-paradise-claims-pro-eu-group","story":"  After Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, blew a hole in the Prime Minister\u0027s key customs proposal - the Facilitated Customs Arrangement - making clear the EU27 would not allow a non-EU member to collect its tariffs, the People\u0026rsquos Vote also picked fault with the UK\u0027s customs blueprint.  It claimed, given there would be no border checks, then smugglers would be free to transport goods in and out of Britain without controls on whether or not duties had been paid.  Consequently, the campaign said false claims about the final destinations of goods could enable smugglers to import into Britain without paying tariffs and then transfer those goods to the EU, thus evading duties that applied there.  \u0026ldquoThe Government is already in a total mess over its fantasy customs plans and this shows the serious consequences that the Brexit chaos has for our country, declared Labour\u0026rsquos Wes Streeting, a leading supporter of The People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \u0026ldquoThe UK has a proud track record in tackling organised crime. For Brexit to make it easier for people to illicitly smuggle goods across our border and not pay their way is simply unacceptable, insisted the London MP.  The backbencher added: \u0026ldquoNobody in Britain voted for the return to a golden age of smuggling. As new facts about Brexit come to light every day, it is clearer than ever that people need to be given a vote on the final deal.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote calculated the \u0026pound1bn Brexit bonanza figure by listing various goods and foodstuffs, which have varying EU tariffs, contrasting them with a zero-rated UK tariff, and then working out how much smugglers could potentially save.  For example, if EU tariffs were evaded: the \u0026pound1bn EU import value of men\u0026rsquos and boys\u0026rsquo shirts from China would produce a \u0026pound132m Brexit bonanza \u0026pound4.6bn of footwear also from China a \u0026pound506m bonanza \u0026pound324m beef from Argentina a \u0026pound41m bonanza and \u0026pound1.8bn of coffee from Brazil a \u0026pound109m bonanza. With other items, the campaign group calculated the total could be \u0026pound1.07bn.  Meanwhile, Lord Price, the former International Trade Minister, warned that a no-deal Brexit would put up the cost of basic foodstuffs \u0026ldquopretty significantly.  Mrs May told farmers and food producers at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys on Thursday that Brexit offered a \"real opportunity\" for Britain\u0026rsquos farming industry.  She and her senior colleagues have insisted the public should be comforted and reassured that the UK Government is taking \u0026ldquosensible measures to stockpile food and medicines should Britain crash out of the EU without an agreement.  But Lord Price, a former managing director at Waitrose, made clear a no-deal Brexit would push up the cost of fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products because they could not be stockpiled.  Noting how 80 per cent of vegetables consumer in the UK came from Europe, the Conservative peer, who left the Government in September, said: \"What you will see is rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - is a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-barking-mad-congratulations-getting-shirty","story":"  HAVE you ever seen one of those little round robot vacuum cleaners that you leave to wander by itself around a room?

But his leading rival, Shahbaz Sharif, rejected the outcome, citing allegations of vote-rigging.  Pakistan\u0026rsquos election commission struggled with technical problems and had to revert to a manual count, delaying the announcement of final results until Friday.  That left it unclear whether the PTI will have a simple majority in the National Assembly or have to form a coalition government.  But that did not stop the 65-year-old Mr Khan from proclaiming his triumph in an address to the nation, in which he pledged to create an Islamic welfare state to provide education and employment for the poor to fulfil a campaign promise to create 10 million jobs.  \u0026ldquoToday in front of you, in front of the people of Pakistan, I pledge I will run Pakistan in such a way as it has never before been run, Mr Khan said.  He vowed to wipe out corruption, strengthen institutions he called dysfunctional and regain national pride by developing international relationships based on respect and equality.  While Mr Khan\u0026rsquos appeared casual and conciliatory in his speech, his words were laced with passion.  He said the United States treats Pakistan like a mercenary, giving it billions of dollars to fight the war on terrorism in a region beset with militant extremists.  \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, so far our relations were one-sided. America thinks that it gives Pakistan money to fight for them. Because of this Pakistan suffered a lot, said Mr Khan, who has been critical of the US-led conflict in neighbouring Afghanistan.  He offered nothing to suggest an improvement in Pakistan\u0026rsquos already testy relationship with Washington since President Donald Trump\u0026rsquos tweets in January that accused Islamabad of taking US aid and returning only lies and deceit.  Seeking good relations with his neighbours, Mr Khan addressed Pakistan\u0026rsquos rival, India.  The two nuclear powers have had a long-running conflict over the disputed region of Kashmir.  \u0026ldquoTake one step toward us and we will take two steps toward you, he said in a peace offering while still decrying widespread human rights abuses in Kashmir.  Mr Khan also advocated an open border policy with Afghanistan, even suggesting the two countries embrace a \u0026ldquoEuropean Union type relationship.  The plan seems unlikely, with Pakistan\u0026rsquos military already building hundreds of border outposts and an accompanying fence along its western frontier with Afghanistan despite often-violent opposition from Kabul.  Mr Khan focused on what he wanted to do for the poor in Pakistan and his vision of a country that bowed to no one, where everyone was equal under the law and taxes were paid by the rich to fund services for the less fortunate.  His campaign message of a new Pakistan seemed to resonate with young voters in a country where 64 percent of its 200 million people are under 30.  Mr Khan said the elections were the most transparent and promised to investigate every complaint of irregularity that his opponents presented.  \u0026ldquoIt is thanks to God (that) we won and we were successful, he said.  More than a dozen TV channels projected the PTI would win as many as 119 seats of the 270 National Assembly seats that were contested, although the broadcasters did not disclose their methodology.  The rest of the 342-seat parliament includes seats reserved for women and minorities.  Voting for two seats was postponed after one candidate died during the campaign and another was disqualified.  Although rights groups and minorities expressed worries ahead of the voting about radical religious groups taking part, moderate voices seemed to have prevailed: none of the 265 candidates fielded by the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba won.  That includes the son of co-founder and US-designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed, who has a 10 million US dollar bounty on his head.  The candidates campaigned under the little known Allah-o-Akbar Tehreek party because Lashkar-e-Taiba is banned.  Even if Mr Khan\u0026rsquos party wins a simple majority, he would need to wait until the president convenes the parliament to swear in the new politicians, traditionally within a week.  He also faces opposition over the result from Mr Sharif.  He heads the Pakistan Muslim League, the party of his older brother, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who is in prison on corruption charges.  TV projections give his party barely 61 seats.  The younger Mr Sharif tweeted that \u0026ldquoour democratic process has been pushed back by decades, adding that \u0026ldquohad the public mandate been delivered in a fair manner, we would have accepted it happily.  Complaints also emerged from the independent Human Rights Commission, which issued a statement saying that women were not allowed to vote in some areas.  In other areas, it said, \u0026ldquopolling staff appeared to be biased toward a certain party, without elaborating.  In the days before the election, leading rights activist I.A. Rehman called the campaign \u0026ldquothe dirtiest in Pakistan\u0026rsquos bumpy journey toward sustained democracy.  Analysts have expressed concern that disgruntled losers could create instability for the incoming government, which must deal with a crumbling economy, crippling debt and a raging militancy.  The voting was marred by a suicide bombing in the southwestern city of Quetta, the Baluchistan provincial capital, that killed 31 people as they waited to vote.  A bombing in the same province earlier this month killed 149 people, including a candidate for office.  Baluchistan has been hit by relentless attacks, both by the province\u0026rsquos secessionists and Sunni militants who have killed hundreds of Shiites there.

It found Edinburgh and Nottingham\u0027s publicly-owned bus companies and strong integrated networks have significantly contributed to their success through stable and accessible bus and tram services, competitive prices and easy to use ticketing, as well as integrated smart ticketing and travel apps.  Meanwhile Birmingham came top for ease of long-distance travel - displacing Edinburgh which dropped to second place - while Swansea, Liverpool and Oxford came third equal.  The ETI, developed by transport and mobility services company ESP Group, questioned almost 5000 people about the ease of use of transport in cities across the UK.  It found across the UK 34% of people sometimes do not leave their homes due to concerns about travel, up from 30% in 2017.  Dr Steve Cassidy, managing director of ESP Group, said: \"Edinburgh has excelled itself once again, maintaining pole position in the rankings which is testament to the strong, integrated transport networks it continues to develop.  \"Our latest Easy Travel Index demonstrates that high proportions of travellers feel routes and timetables can often make local and long-distance travel difficult.  \"Numerous people in cities across the UK aren\u0027t finding travel options easy due to a variety of network challenges, difficulties with interactions, touchpoints and the overall service offering.  \"There is much excellent work being done by authorities and operators to make travel easier. But not everyone is benefiting - in large part due to a lack of awareness and concerns about ease of use. 24% of people did not claim compensation for their delayed train because they expected it to be difficult, while 29% did not even know they could make a claim.\"  The researchers surveyed 4991 people aged 16 and over from across 45 towns, cities and regions.  They found just under a third (30%) of people who required assistance to travel by rail did not request help from the train operating company because they felt uncomfortable doing so.  One in five (22%) said they did not even know that passenger assistance existed.  The study found throughout the UK the rising cost of transport is the biggest difficulty facing those surveyed.  Just over a third (34%) of people report cost of transport affects their local travel, rising to 44% for long-distance travel.  Dr Cassidy said: \"Some of the statistics from the ETI report make alarming reading. There are so many initiatives to support passengers in using public transport and help them understand how to use the system and make travel easier - even when things go wrong.  \"These include new forms of payment and travel apps as well as services to assist those needing a little more help.  \"However, the impact of these services is being constrained due to a lack of understanding amongst the wider public: regular users may understand and use services but the occasional and new user still is not aware or is uncertain of use.

He said: \"We are pleased that Summerhall have stepped-up as the first major Fringe employer to support the aims of the Fair Hospitality Charter and recognise Unite as the union for their staff.\"  \"We hope that this sends a clear message to other Fringe employers that they can and should mark themselves out as a decent employer willing to reward their hard-working staff accordingly.\"  Unite wants venues to pay the living wages, give rest breaks, equal pay for young workers, have no zero hour contracts, end unpaid trial shifts, implement anti-sexual harassment policies, pay for transport home after midnight, get 100% of tips, and allow union access.  Anthony Alderson, who runs the equally key Pleasance venue, said: \"We are delighted that Summerhall is being able to take the steps they have done this week.  \"Pleasance are committed to offering the very best opportunities to the many people who come back year on year to take part.  \"It is important to recognise that there are several different models and one size does not fit all.\"  The Pleasance has a team of 200 volunteers at the Fringe this year.

When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.                                                                                                        Although the departure of the tap will come as sad news for many nut butter lovers, those looking for a new topping for their desserts won’t have to wait too long, as Mackie’s is close to finalising the tap’s replacement flavour.Yvette added: “I don’t want to give too much away just yet, but for many this will be a taste of their childhood and an all-round favourite for waffles, crepes and sundae scoops.“The new tap could well be ready to go in the next week so make sure you head down to the parlour and be one of the first to try our new creation.”In addition to the success of the taps, Mackie’s is also on course for their most successful summer of sales ever.                                                                                                        The family firm recorded its strongest ever ice cream sales in its 30-plus year history in May – a figure surpassed in June, thanks to the warm summer and growing export sales.Mackie’s of Scotland produces luxury ice cream at its fourth-generation family farm in Westertown, Aberdeenshire. The company started producing ice cream in 1986 using milk and dairy from its own herds. Mackie’s distributes its products to the UK and worldwide.

While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Friday 27 Jul 2018 11:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades. It will also enable us to start some engineering works.There are some issues regarding the age of the harbour. Part of the stonework has shifted and needs some work.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaFriday 27 Jul 2018 11:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers.

As part of the disposal, Menzies will retain a 10 per cent equity stake in the business, while Menzies Distribution will be responsible for the funding of Section B of the Menzies defined benefit pension scheme, which represents 17 per cent of the assets and liabilities of that scheme as at 31 December.John Menzies chairman Dermot Smurfit said: “I am delighted to announce today the sale of Menzies Distribution. In doing so we create a ‘pure play’ aviation services business that operates in a structural growth market and is very well-placed to take advantage of the many exciting opportunities that exist.”Upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to shareholder approval and expected to complete in September, Forsyth Black, currently president and managing director of Menzies Aviation, will be appointed chief executive of John Menzies and will be supported by Giles Wilson, chief financial officer and John Geddes, group company secretary and corporate affairs director.Smurfit added: “In his role as Menzies CEO, Forsyth Black will now focus on growing our market share in the aviation services market, increasing our operating margins and continuing to deliver excellent services to our customers.”The firm is set to report its interim results on 14 August."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774586.1532628570!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy i lapped up brexit s fairytale but it s become a nightmare","story":"        The goodies always win in fairytales, but in real life Brexit bad guy Boris seems poised for victory, writes Jim Duffy.                There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris? A playing field you are comfortable in and very newsworthy to boot.            READ MORE: Two thirds of young Scots believe Brexit will be ‘bad’But, if we can just get back to the main plot. The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia.

No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 27 Jul 2018 11:38 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land.

We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

We are told that party officers met at the weekend but all we have had since then is a bizarre defence of his actions from Sammy Wilson.\n\"The DUP leadership must end its silence on this issue.

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
