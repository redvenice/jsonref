Let me fat in peace.’She also hinted last week that whether there was a baby or not, fans wouldn’t hear until the supposed baby arrived, or not.She said: ‘Certain things about me have to be private. You can not invade my privacy, I’m not a damn animal at the zoo where you just could see everything.Cardi hid her bump during the first performance of the night (Picture: Saturday Night Live)‘No!

I took an inaugural voyage from Malaga to Barcelona to find out.Firstly, it is, of course, huge.In port, Symphony towers over the dockside and even looks down on the roofs of high office buildings.To be able to float, this 228,000-ton ship is basically hollow on the inside.From deck 16, where you enter the Ultimate Abyss slide, you stare down to deck six, where it emerges.Also on that level is a boardwalk with restaurants, a water theatre and even a carousel.At the other end of the ship is a park with 12,000 plants and trees.You can choose from 19 places to eat, ranging from hot dog kiosks to huge dining rooms.I opted for Chops Grille, a favourite from my trips on two of Symphony’s sister ships, Oasis of the Seas and Harmony of the Seas.Having started with a crispy goat cheese salad with green apple, candied walnuts, cranberries and balsamic vinegar, I went full-on carnivore with a fillet steak cooked to perfection – as good as anything you’d find on land.Just a few feet away, past a bar that levitates between decks (if you fancy a cocktail on the go) is Jamie’s Italian and the excellent wine bar, Vintages.For something a little special, I recommend Wonderland, which features an imaginative collection of dishes based on wind, ice, fire, sea, earth and dreams.Even the entrance resembles Alice’s rabbit hole and the furniture is very Mad Hatter-ish.To wear off those calories, you’d like to do some exercise, right?Well, just getting around the ship is a workout in itself. I racked up 10,000 steps a day simply wandering along and between decks.It takes a while to orientate yourself and every trip back to your room can involve strolling along seemingly endless corridors.I realise that, despite the 24 lifts, there isn’t one moving walkway to help you along decks.Then, of course, there are the thrills and spills. I took part in a laser tag game battling for the last planet in the galaxy (as you do).For this, the ice rink on deck four is transformed with inflatable walls into a maze of rooms on an abandoned space station.Players are ided into robots and aliens in a showdown to find the fastest and most accurate shooters.What about the ten-storey slide?I had to chicken out this time due to an arm injury but, having braved the Ultimate Abyss on Harmony of the Seas, I can assure you it is 14 seconds of twists, turns, lights and darkness (and, I admit, screams) as you hurtle on a mat round spiralling purple tubes. Definitely worth a try.You can also test your head for heights by taking the zip line.Or you might want to try body boarding in the surf machine, or making a splash riding the water chutes in Perfect Storm.Those that prefer a more relaxing holiday can chill out in the spa, take a dip in the pools, play mini golf, enjoy the huge Solarium or walk the corridors and stairwells admiring the hundreds of works of art.Suite dreams: the Ultimate Family Suite (Picture: SBWRoyal Caribbean)One advantage of the ship’s huge size is the ability to stage big productions, such as the West End show Hairspray.Cruise entertainment sometimes gets a bad rap but, done on this scale in a 1,400-seat theatre, it is mesmerising and yet another example of the value for money you get at sea.If you like your shows to be more acrobatic, head for the AquaTheater where ers and dancers perform stunts and acts above a deep pool.New on Symphony of the Seas is the Ultimate Family Suite with a slide from the bedrooms to the living room, an air hockey table, Lego wall and 3D giant TV screen.To stay here, you pay upwards of £30,000 a week. Some doting parents have paid twice that amount to bag the room for a very special Christmas away.A seafood restaurant Hooked and the Playmakers Sports Bar \u0026amp Arcade (which has, in a nod to ocean liners of old, an electronic shuffleboard game) join the dining venues.Guests with a sweet tooth can also indulge themselves at the Sugar Beach Candy Store.On deck five is the Royal Promenade, a selection of shops, restaurants and even an English pub.The robot bartenders (Picture: SBWRoyal Caribbean)It is hard to believe as you walk down this wide mall that you are on a ship. At one end is a bionic bar with two robot bartenders.Simply tap in your favourite cocktail on an iPad and the machines spin, twist, shake, stir – and serve. They may be short on banter, but you can’t fault their measures.A ship this big isn’t for everyone. If hell is other people, then being afloat with thousands of other souls won’t be your idea of fun.But it is surprising just how those numbers dissipate around the decks, which means it is still possible to find a quiet spot in a bar or lounge.Symphony of the Seas may be large, noisy and colourful.But, away from all the slides, chutes and shops, I still had time to stand on my private balcony and admire the sun slowly setting over the horizon, turning the clouds crimson, as we sailed to the next port.And isn’t that what cruising is all about?A seven-night Western Mediterranean voyage on Symphony of the Seas leaving Civitavecchia (Rome) on 21 June costs from £1,529 a person, based on two people sharing an inside room. Price includes return flights from London Gatwick (royalcaribbean.co.uk).Dave Monk also writes about cruising on shipmonk.co.uk.

He’s got a very busy schedule I imagine.Asked why Harry seems so at ease with the competitors, he replied: I think it’s because he’s around military people. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t served. I think that’s why he’s so comfortable, he’s around like-minded people.After meeting Meghan for the first time he said: “She was lovely, like you see on the TV. Very polite and humble, so just great. She asked me what I was doing, how I was. She was cool, really cool, just like I imagined.Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm to an IED in Helmand Province in 2007, said he would be watching their big day on TV.He said: “We will be at home glued to the box watching it and wishing them all the best not just on the day but for their future together. The buzz around London that day will be phenomenal. I might even take a trip up there.He said the royal visit to the team trials was a “huge morale boost”, adding: “The respect that the guys have got for Harry is unreal.

That makes him a lot different.“I couldn’t imagine living the life he has and having that of normality and being able to do that, he must be really grateful for that. We all just look in on that and are happy for him.Speaking about the surge in applications to compete at this year\u0027s Games, he said: I love it, the buzz is even bigger this year. It’s crazy.

Osborne denies these accusations.The Russian has featured prominently in US prosecutor Robert Mueller\u0027s investigation over his ties to former chairman of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort.He has also been accused of illegal wiretapping, extortion, racketeering, money laundering, and death threats against business rivals.Shares in his energy company EN+ dropped 19 per cent on the London Stock Exchange after the sanctions were announced, wiping £1billion from its market value.

SDN stands for \u0027Specially Designated National.\u0027          George Osborne (pictured) joined Deripaska on his yacht in 2008Deripaska, estimated by Forbes magazine to have a net worth of £4.7billion, is the main owner of the conglomerate EN+, which is the co-owner of some of the world\u0027s biggest metals producers, Rusal and Nornickel.Hong Kong-listed Rusal is one of the world\u0027s biggest aluminium producers. It says exports to the United States account for over 10 per cent of its output.Rusal owns assets in Italy, Ireland, Sweden, Nigeria, Guyana, Guinea.According to a Rusal prospectus, its major customers include Glencore, Toyota, and Rio Tinto Alcan.In his life and career, Deripaska has frequently intersected with the Kremlin and Russian officialdom. He holds regular meetings with President Vladimir Putin, he invested heavily in building infrastructure for Russia\u0027s 2014 Sochi winter Olympics, and has said his own interests are inisible from the state\u0027s interests.The mother of Deripaska\u0027s children, Polina, is the daughter of Valentin Yumashev, who was presidential chief of staff under former Russian president Boris Yeltsin. Yumashev later married Yeltsin\u0027s daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.           Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort (pictured), who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump          \u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on TuesdayYeltsin and his entourage were instrumental in elevating Vladimir Putin to power as the anointed successor to the ailing president.Deripaska did business in the 2000s with Paul Manafort, who later became campaign manager for Donald Trump when he was running for president.Last year the Washington Post reported that Manafort sent an email in July 2016 offering Deripaska private briefings about Donald Trump\u0027s presidential campaign. Manafort was chairman of the campaign at the time.Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni has said the email exchanges were \u0027innocuous\u0027 and aimed at collecting money owed by past clients.   Raising the stakes: Senior Trump officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort by the U.S. to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin\u0027s government and his inner circle  Industry bigs: Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate whose Rusal is one of the country\u0027s biggest companies and who has ties to ex-Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort is being hit, as is Gazprom CEO Alexi MillerThis latest wave of sanctions come as senior U.S. administration officials cast the penalties as part of a concerted and ongoing effort to push back at  Putin and his inner circle. But Trump has continued to avoid directly criticizing Putin himself, and recently invited the Russian leader to meet with him, possibly at the White House.Still, in recent weeks Trump\u0027s administration has rolled out a series of actions - including several economic and diplomatic steps - to increase pressure on Putin and those in his circle.\u0027Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,\u0027 Trump said at a news conference on Tuesday.Rather than punishing Russia for one specific action, the new sanctions are in response to \u0027the totality of the Russian government\u0027s ongoing and increasingly brazen pattern\u0027 of bad behavior, said the officials, who weren\u0027t authorized to comment by name and briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.It was not clear whether any of those hit have significant, or any, holdings that would be covered and most of them were warned of possible penalties in January when they were identified as possible targets on lists published by the Treasury and State departments.   Pout of order: Kiril Shamalov, who is believed to be married to Putin\u0027s daughter Katerina Tikhonova, is one of those facing new sanctions  Friends and allies: Igor Rotenberg\u0027s father is one of Putin\u0027s oldest friends while Andrey Kostin heads Russia\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the stateThe administration officials said Americans who may currently have business with them would be given guidance about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The officials ticked through a list of activities they said had prompted the U.S. to act, including Russia\u0027s annexation of Crimea, backing separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, cyber-hacking and attempts to subvert Western democracy.Many of the targets are iniduals and businesses associated with Russia\u0027s energy sector, including those affiliated with state-owned Gazprom. Officials said the goal was to show that those who have benefited financially from Putin\u0027s position of power are fair game for U.S. punishments, noting that many of those being sanctioned are closely tied to Putin himself.Targets include:Kirill Shamalov, who is reportedly Putin\u0027s son-in-law, married to his daughter Katerina Tikhonova, although neither Putin nor the Kremlin have acknowledged that she is his daughter.Igor Rotenberg, the son of Arkady Rotenberg, a friend of Putin\u0027s since they were teenagers.Andrey Kostin, named among government officials, heads the nation\u0027s second-largest bank, VTB, which is controlled by the state.Alexei Miller, the longtime head of the state-controlled Gazprom natural gas giant. Both Miller and Kostin are longtime key members of Putin\u0027s team.          Victim: Sergei Skripal, a Russian who spied for Britain, was poisoned with a nerve agent prompting tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats. His daughter Yulia (left) was also left seriously illOther oligarchs on the list include some top names on the Forbes\u0027 list of billionaires, aren\u0027t part of Putin\u0027s inner circle but like any other billionaire tycoons in Russia they vie for the Kremlin\u0027s attention to preserve and extend their business empires.Many of the Russian oligarchs and politicians and affiliated businesses had already been identified by the Treasury and State Department as potential targets on a list that was compiled and published in January.One of those hit by Friday\u0027s sanctions, Konstantin Kosachev, the chairman of the Russian Federation Council\u0027s foreign affairs committee, expressed surprise he had not already been blacklisted by the U.S.\u0027As far as I am concerned the only thing I\u0027m surprised at is that this didn\u0027t happen earlier,\u0027 he told the Interfax news agency. \u0027I never made secret of my criticism of the U.S. foreign policy, and I will not change my stance.\u0027The sanctions freeze any assets that those targeted have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from doing business with them.           On their way home: Russian diplomats kicked out of the U.S. were picked up by government bus in Moscow on Sunday, while later in the week American embassy staff flew back to the U.S.But the administration said it would give guidance to Americans who may currently have business with them about how to wind down that business and avoid running afoul of the sanctions.The Trump administration used a variety of legal mechanisms to implement the sanctions, including the Countering America\u0027s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act.Known as CAATSA, the law was overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 2017 and signed by President Donald Trump despite some objections. The law aims to punish Russia for interfering in the U.S. election as well as actions intended to subvert democracy in Europe. The law also authorizes the president to impose sanctions on Iran for destabilizing activity in the Middle East and North Korea for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.Last month, the U.S. targeted 19 Russians and five other entities with sanctions in the first use of the law. The administration has also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and shut down two Russian consulates in response to Russian behavior, including the poisoning of an ex-spy in Britain that has been blamed on Moscow."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/07/11/4AE7C43600000578-5588811-image-m-23_1523097957393.jpg","title":"Prince Charles dons grass skirt traditional ceremony Vanuatu historic one day visit","story":"    The prince received a warm welcome in Vanuatu, where he was made a high chief in a colourful ceremony          Prince Charles donned a grass skirt for the traditional welcoming ceremony, where he was honoured as a distinguished guest   The prince also took a sip from a cup of special kava, known as Royal Kava, before planting two trees and trying out the local skirtware  The prince immersed himself into every aspect of Vanuatu\u0027s culture, and was not reluctant to try on traditional skirts          The prince arrived to a rapturous welcome in Vanuatu where many of the local said they were delighted he had taken the trouble to visit          Prince Charles visited the Chief\u0027s  Nakamal, a traditional meeting place for chiefs where he was given a VIP reception          Prince Charles in Brisbane joked he will never again be able to fit into a pair of \u0027budgie smugglers\u0027 -

Cosy up in a cashmere knit by Victoria Beckham like MeghanGet it hereEven before Meghan Markle and Prince Harry announced their engagment, everyone loved the couple.And now that they have set a date for the wedding, there is an even bigger frenzy, particularly over the glamorous bride-to-be who is shaking things up in the royal family.From joining the royals on Christmas Day in Sandringham (unheard of before marriage), to wearing a partially sheer dress in one of her official engagement photos, Meghan is not playing by the rules and everyone loves a rebel. For their visit to Belfast, Meghan recycled a trusty cashmere knit by Victoria Beckham.

We were both extremely excited. \u0027I jokingly asked if she knew what she was letting herself in for and she said: \u0027Well, it\u0027s going to be an experience and at least it will be a fun night.\u0027\u0027After the date, she was telling me what a great guy he was, a real gentleman, genuinely nice, and when I asked if she would see him again she said: \u0027Well, it looks like it.\u0027 \u0027In fact, Harry asked her out again the next day and after just a few dates, invited Meghan to join him at a secret hideaway in Botswana. There, he escorted her on her first wildlife safari. For Harry, the location held a special significance: Prince Charles took him and his brother William to Africa shortly after the death of Princess Diana.On their return, Meghan told Gina how they had stayed in a tent with spectacular views and had bonded over a shared love of wildlife and conservation.\u0027I\u0027m sure that the Botswana trip is what clinched the deal,\u0027 says Gina.\u0027I knew that would do it for them – Africa has that effect. When they were back, she showed me the most wonderful photographs of the two of them on her phone. \u0027They were so clearly already in love. She told me it was serious and they had started discussing the future.

It might be his last word on architecture. There is the city – specifically Waterloo Bridge, the Houses of Parliament and the grimy lead-shot factory opposite the balcony on which he is working – and there is the ever-changing play of climate, atmosphere and light around them. The buildings are just a pretext for painting the sublime.Weather and waterlilies, haystacks, poplars and seascapes: Monet (1840-1926) is not an artist of bricks and mortar. And even after seeing almost 80 paintings linking him with architecture, I doubt anyone will have their mind changed on this score. Of course he is indelibly associated with certain cities – there are seven paintings of London, eight of Rouen and nine of Venice at the National Gallery – but the show’s premise is at the very least counterintuitive. What does Monet have to do with architecture? An early surprise is just how many different structures edge into his paintings. He paints a pitched fishing shack against a blustery sea near Le Havre and scarlet windmills cartwheeling across a flat Dutch horizon. One Parisian scene shows the side of an apartment block emblazoned with a massive advertisement, another centres on pedestrians milling along the stepped quays. A shadowy figure stands framed in a medieval doorway. Light filters through the sloping glass roof of the new Gare Saint-Lazare. In Giverny, in winter, the houses are like loaves of soft snow.So far, it seems as if Monet is drawn to them all purely as shapes, combinations of rectilinear or triangular forms subjected to weather. And many of these built structures conjure classic Monet – cottages shaped like haystacks bridge struts recalling stands of poplars or gondola poles. But it soon becomes apparent that architecture, both complex and primitive, offers Monet far more.The Pont Neuf in rainy smog is a study in the innumerable different nuances of taupe, grey and pearl. A red-tiled roof sharpens up the predominant green of a landscape. A tiny house is like an index to the vast scale of the surrounding countryside. Monet is always preoccupied by what the eye can take in of each scene, near and far, at the fullest scope and all at once. An early driver, he motored so fast around Giverny the mayor gave him a speeding ticket in 1904.Architecture is a constructive element, so to speak, in Monet’s picture-making. It might be a way of taking the eye into or around a painting. A vision of clifftops, sandy shore and the great opening blur of the sea is pinned together, for instance, by a little steeple. It is not much more than a circumflex, but enough to orientate the eye. And one of the most exhilarating works in this show, The Hollow in the Cliff Path at Varengeville, shows the eponymous path as a hot, dark gully leading to a tantalising glimpse of wild blue yonder. The sense of anticipation is intensified by a cottage high on the cliff, a kind of human surrogate that seems to see, and even to be looking at, what we cannot – the glittering sea beyond.The opening galleries are brilliantly selected to disrupt any conventional view of Monet’s evolution as an artist. In the early 1870s he is depicting windmills and Dutch houses, their gable ends traced in paint as stiff and thick as royal icing. And then here he is again, barely moments later, with a view of Amsterdam so hazy it’s nearly vanishing from the canvas and you think it’s all there, the substantial world transmuted into air.And then he jumps back, next decade, to lush strokes and oily accretions that build thick on the substrate and even, occasionally, to quite detailed cobblestones. His trajectory was never straight from old realism to modern abstraction. Subject always dictates style. Steam in the Paris stations is diaphanous damp sand at the new resort of Trouville is almost claggy the Doge’s Palace melts like golden butter.A notion, a recollection, an effect: his kind of impressionism does not deal in hard data. You couldn’t make an exact blueprint of the facade of Rouen Cathedral from any of the paintings in his great 1890s series. But you can deduce season, rainfall, the beauty of the circumambient air around the medieval structure above all, the passage of time.Monet worked variously in an empty apartment and a ladies’ clothes shop opposite the cathedral, for up to 12 hours a day. The effects were so fleeting – a colour, he said, lasts no more than three or four minutes – that he might alternate between several different canvases. At 8am the cathedral shimmers in lemon light but the streets around it are still in blue shadow. Later that morning the sunshine turns golden and the traceries have higher definition. At dusk, the portals fill with gloomy purple shadows.The angle shifts, the light changes, the focus pulls from one view to the next – in sequence, the paintings almost move.Monet compared the cathedral to a cliff. Architecture is nature by other means for him. Each subject is a structure on which to hang the memory of a gradual dawn, a glowing form or fog. That is what this marvellous exhibition reveals through its clarifying emphasis on one limited subject – that for Monet, the experience of seeing always comes first.And it is the same for the viewer standing before these ever-modern works. Rouen Cathedral, in rare loans from Belgrade and Cardiff, is translucent as fragile honeycomb or thick as rose and lavender blossoms, the surface muzzy and matt. In Venice, Monet floats on water. His cropping is so radical that the paintings put you right in the middle of the Grand Canal watching the buildings dissolve in the late light. What beauty there is in the art, the mind and surely the working days spent before the palaces and churches. People talk of the melancholy in the Venetian period, but it is not obvious to me. This late room is dreamily ecstatic.Boat-loaders on the Paris quays, the tricolour blur of fluttering French flags, the dark chimneys of the lead-shot factory on the South Bank: there are many unexpected scenes in this show. But no matter how erse, all are concerned with optical experience: the total effect on the eye, then the mind and memory. Each is a complete vision, not pieced together in fragments or details the very antithesis of architecture in that way.And from the Savoy, the bridges cross the Thames like the wooden structures over the pond at Giverny. Parliament becomes an apparition, its spikes softened by fog and dusk. They are all still there, the recognisable s, domes and towers, but not as stony structures so much as an ethereal stage for the ceaseless and ever-changing play of Monet’s art."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee204099e044de123a4bc85db11afe8356f0587d/0_410_6144_3686/master/6144.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=77f433c31b4b17f1281cb3ae5be18d05 2600w","title":"new centre point hoover building london luxury flats review","story":"Denounced as vulgar when they were built, these newly desirable London landmarks have been reborn as luxury flats boasting distinctive dimensions as well as chequered pasts“With Britain’s entry into the EEC,” barked an early 1970s advert, “Centre Point, London, offers an unrivalled opportunity to organisations with imagination to occupy this spectacular office complex.” How times change. Now, with Britain’s impending exit from the EU, the same building offers an unrivalled opportunity for iniduals wishing to spend £1.8m on a one-bedroom flat or £55m on a penthouse, the first of whom have been gradually moving in since last Christmas. A Crossrail station at its base will whisk owners from Tottenham Court Road to Heathrow airport in 28 minutes and thence to the new global opportunities promised by Brexiters.Meanwhile, nine miles west of Centre Point’s central location, the celebrated former Hoover factory, whose colonnaded art deco billboard of a facade merges ancient Karnak with American roadside industry, is also turning into flats. For there’s an entropy in the contemporary property business, its own second law of thermodynamics, which states that eventually everything becomes residential.These two white edifices, the temple and the tower, have something in common. Both were deplored by Nikolaus Pevsner, the architectural historian and postwar cataloguer of British architecture who made deploring into a one-man, quasi-nationalised industry. The Hoover, for him, was a “modernistic atrocity”, Centre Point “coarse in the extreme”. Both buildings, decried for their commercial vulgarity, have now inveigled their way into public and official affection. Spun around in the great washing machine of taste, both are now listed as buildings of architectural interest.Centre Point, completed in 1966, has a special status in cultural history, for the fact that it stood empty for years while its owner, Harry Hyams, tried to find the one big corporation that would take it at the rents he wanted. It was claimed that the developer kept it purposely unoccupied for accounting reasons, as he could watch his paper profits grow as property values shot up. Hyams, a publicity-shy man who once wore a Mickey Mouse mask to a shareholders’ meeting to avoid being photographed, took successful legal action against such claims, but empty his tower nonetheless was.At a time when, as now, there was seen to be a housing crisis, Centre Point managed to unify the Tory minister Peter Walker and the folk group Lindisfarne in opposing its sterile, antisocial pursuit of profit. The former attacked this “incredible scandal”. “Your madness is making a machine of everyone,” went the latter’s 1972 single All Fall Down, which featured the tower on its sleeve. Architectural reviews were more varied. Not everyone shared Pevsner’s scorn: some critics scented swinging London in its slender profile and zigzag rhythms. Neither Hyams nor his pipe-smoking architect, Colonel Richard Seifert, was exactly Mick Jagger or Marianne Faithfull, but you can see what these observers were thinking.It is indeed London’s most stylish tower, even now, when, in quantity if not quality, there is so much competition. Broad on its two convex faces and miraculously thin at its ends, it has the merit of changing in proportion as it appears from different parts of the city. It tapers towards the top, like a classical column. Its skilful and bold structure, by the engineer Wilem Frischmann, is worn on the outside, in the form of that zigzag lattice, precast with a concrete mix of almost marble-like whiteness. The tower occupies its singular spot with confidence and bravura, terminating Oxford Street and calling across Fitzrovia to its equally idiosyncratic contemporary, the BT Tower. It has presence, its mass energised by the design’s devotion to angles other than 90 degrees.Centre Point is the outcome of particular forms of talent, not all of them concerned primarily with beauty: Hyams’s as a developer, for example. It grew from Seifert’s special skill at working the planning system to his clients’ advantage, in this case giving the local authority a traffic gyratory system that they wanted in return for unexpected height. Seifert’s design partner, George Marsh, whose name is attached to a majority of the practice’s most memorable buildings, borrowed liberally from the great buildings of the recent past to give Centre Point its distinctive look. The profile owes much to Gio Ponti’s Pirelli tower in Milan, the expressive concrete to the mature work of Marcel Breuer. You can call it homage, or copying, but it works.Cynical and expedient though it partly was, Centre Point had architectural qualities – form, composition, detail, depth, light and shadow – that are hard to find in most speculative buildings, then as now. So it is welcome that it should be given a new life by the developer Almacantar and the architectural practice Conran and Partners in an updated version of Seifertian louche luxury. A pedestrianised open space, to the designs of another practice, Mica, will open in phases from this summer.The worst part of Seifert’s design was always the gyratory system that the planners saw as its main benefit, which, together with some wilfully mean pavements, made for an obnoxious and dangerous public space. The revamp loses some of the dynamism and distinctiveness of the old, but it’s preferable not to be asphyxiated and run over.The Hoover factory, now known as the Hoover building, never reached Centre Point’s heights of controversy, but when it opened in 1933 in the nascent suburb of Perivale, it was still seen as a dangerous manifestation of an arterial-road Americana that the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 would eventually stamp out. Like Centre Point, it combines stasis and motion, with the venerable forms of ancient Egypt repurposed to attract the attention of drivers on the roaring A40.It, too, has been set to music, although more affectionately than Centre Point, in Elvis Costello’s Hoover Factory of 1980. “Must have been a wonder when it was brand new,” he carolled. And it has always been a delight, for its powerful horizontals offset by insistent verticals, for the exuberant ornament that plays off its solemn columns, for its absolute indifference to stylistic propriety, which allowed its architects Wallis Gilbert and Partners to throw Bauhaus glazing, expressionist corner windows and Native American forms into the eclectic mix. Its colours too: its sunny white concrete, the hopeful minty green of its steel window frames, the outbursts of red and rich blue in its glazed bricks.“One of these days”, as Costello sang, it’s “gonna be all the rage in those fashionable pages”. And here it is, its value enhanced by the shocking demolition in 1980 of the nearby Firestone factory, also by Wallis Gilbert and Partners, over a bank holiday weekend. (Its owners wanted to pre-empt the Firestone’s probable listing.) The Hoover building is now in its second reincarnation, having been taken over by Tesco in the 1980s. Its less glamorous rear buildings were replaced by a superstore that still stands. Its front, used for offices by the retail giant, is now apartments, laid out to the designs of the engineering and architecture practice Interrobang.The most interesting thing about Interrobang’s conversion, a light timber frame designed to minimise loading on the existing structure, is sadly not visible. It would have been nice to keep a sense of this, as if installing an inside-out Amish village in the old factory, but the conventions of the residential property market don’t allow for such adventure. What you get instead are flats of proportions and spatial complexity that come from their adjustment to the old fabric.There is some weirdness – the noise from the road and from Tesco deliveries means you mostly can’t open windows and have to rely on a ventilation system for fresh air – but the spaces are still livelier and richer than you’d get in a new building.Centre Point makes for nice flats too (as they should be for the price): long and slightly curving glass walls combined with the reassuring depth of the structure. This makes one grateful for the listing of relatively modern buildings, eccentric though the system sometimes is. As the rest of the planning system gets ever more flaccid, listing at least obliges architects to come up with non-standard designs and developers to pay them to do so.The pioneering engineer of Centre Point looks back on the London landmark’s construction and the new type of building it ushered inThe engineer Wilem Frischmann, now aged 87 and still working, was not yet 30 when he designed the structure of Centre Point in central London. He says the site was made so complicated by pre-existing sewers and tube tunnels that no one had thought it possible to build much more than a single storey there – “only some shops”. “When I grew up,” says Frischmann, “I was told you can’t build tower blocks on clay” – the stuff on which London stands – so he made a point of showing that you could. Frischmann’s method was to drill close-packed piled foundations into the ground (he inspected the holes himself, got stuck in one and had to spend the night there until it was discovered how to get him out). The tower above is then unusually light, using thin floor slabs and the system of external structural elements that are the building’s signature. Precast in Portland, Dorset, and trucked to the site by night, these enabled the tower to rise at a rate of a storey a week. Their concrete was exceptionally strong, and its steel reinforcement has not suffered from the sort of corrosion that often forces structures of Centre Point’s age to be demolished.Frischmann, a man unafraid to point out his achievements, is most proud of the glazed walls of a horizontal box that is a bridge between the tower and a lower block, over what was until recently a busy road. This, he says, is the first use of structural glass – panels that support themselves without the help of frames. It has become commonplace in sleek modernism since. How did he come up with the idea? “I just tried to do things differently,” he says.

But 30 years ago, when the author was growing up there, Canary Wharf was a wasteland. She tracks the shifts and asks: was it worth it?The house I lived in, growing up on London’s Isle of Dogs, was beside a huge gate and high walls – impenetrable barriers even to the naughty kids who wanted to explore the docks beyond. My friends and I remember glimpses of watery wastelands as we walked off the Thames peninsula that we all called “the Island”, on rickety bridges whose gaps and creaks featured in our nightmares.When, 30 years ago this month, Margaret Thatcher drove the first pile for Canary Wharf and promised a land of opportunity, those high walls came down. But by the time its celebrated pyramid roof was placed on One Canada Square in 1991, Thatcher had been ousted and the London commercial property market had collapsed. It was quite possibly the worst time to launch and, within a year, Olympia and York, the company charged with making the neoliberal dream of turning redundant docks into the reality of a gleaming financial citadel, filed for bankruptcy.But now, Canary Wharf provides as many jobs as the docks did when they acted as a linchpin between the City of London and the global trade of the British empire. Canary Wharf’s first building, the second tallest in the UK after the Shard, is now as much a part of London’s skyline as the Empire State in New York and the area, with a further massive expansion already under way, is now more Wall Street than wasteland.Yet the past three decades have not only tracked the boom and bust of the UK economy but have left the Isle of Dogs a microcosm of the social revolution that has changed the face of Britain. At the same time, the extremes of income inequality – from great wealth to desperate deprivation – have revealed social tensions that bedevil the country as a whole.My mum and sisters still live on the island and I go back all the time when the development first started, I had just gone to university and each holiday brought a new road network to negotiate and a new building site to discuss. I thought things could only get better for everyone living there, yet it took the surprise of Brexit to make me realise that the reality has been very different.Local deprivation levels are among the worst in the country and a sense of powerlessness, which may have started as a reaction to the unaccountable regeneration scheme, now seems more widespread. The transport, shopping and leisure opportunities might have been revolutionised, but for a surprising number living there, Canary Wharf appears just as impenetrable as the docks were when I was a child.Someone who remembers these times keenly is the Right Rev Nick Holtam, now the bishop of Salisbury. He was appointed to the local church in 1988 with an episcopal remit to try to improve community relations. Residents objected to the unelected nature of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the quango in charge of planning: there were marches and protests, one involving 60 dog-driven sheep and more than 150 bees.Holtam remembers taking his congregation to a special service beside Millwall dock. “For lots of people, that was new territory, but there’s an invisible wall now, isn’t there?” he says. “People who live round the edge don’t all feel as though it’s their space to go into and it feels quite smart and City and businesslike.”There have been enormous successes, of course, many of which were trumpeted in a special report commissioned by Canary Wharf to mark this year’s 30th anniversary. Canary Wharf Group has presided over the largest urban regeneration project in Europe, with more than 17m sq ft of London real estate providing the head offices for many global firms, from Barclays to Reuters. With 120,000 jobs, Canary Wharf claims to be the biggest single centre of employment in the UK.The change in the transport system has been even more remarkable. Young people at my old school on the island look at me like some sort of relic when I tell them that a 277 bus was the only form of public transport in the 1980s. It could take as little as 15 minutes or three times as long to get to my Saturday jobs in Poplar because of the way the bridge system played havoc on the roads. When the Docklands Light Railway was opened in 1987, everyone scoffed at its toy train driverless cars but, with a network that extends to Stratford and Woolwich in the east and Bank and Tower Gateway in the west, some 122 million people use it every year. Throw in, too, the underground lines: the Jubilee line opened in 1999 and, by the end of this year, a new east-west Elizabeth line station will be in place at Canary Wharf.Looking back, the regeneration was a help to me personally. I was the first in my family to go to university and during college holidays I got lucrative work as a temp in some of the office buildings sprouting up. Yet for many residents, such employment has been harder to come by. Now, just one-tenth of the people working in Canary Wharf are residents of the borough, Tower\u0026nbspHamlets.The larger companies moving in, such as Citibank and HSBC, may have taken advantage of the big business rate concessions, but they have tended to bring their staff with them. Jill Skeels has lived on the island for 48 years and describes the difficulties her daughter faced trying to get a local job. “I walked round the whole of Canary Wharf with my daughter, giving out CVs … never heard another word. So imagine how we feel. When you think of all what we’ve put up with and our kids can’t even get anything. I don’t think you’re bitter, I don’t think that’s the right word, but you just feel walked\u0026nbspover.”Years ago, talking to students from my old school about becoming a journalist, I remember one teenager saying she wanted to work in an office but couldn’t imagine getting a job in Canary Wharf. At the time, I think I brushed it off as one 14-year-old’s lack of confidence but it stuck with me and now I realise she wasn’t alone.Time and again, talking to people in bingo halls or community associations, it’s the older white generation who are angriest about the changes. Rich Gerrard is an ex-docker: “The people in this area feel that no matter what they do, it’s a plan that they ain’t part of,” he says. “We are in the path of a runaway train.”Howard Dawber, who has been managing director of strategy at the Canary Wharf Group since 2004, says much of the early anger was from people such as Gerrard who “wanted the docks back”. Very few middle-aged dockers got jobs in Canary Wharf, though one, Peter Wade, was appointed as the development’s first community development officer in 1988. He became a local cause celebre, a “poacher turned gamekeeper”.The Canary Wharf Group, which has gone through several changes of ownership and now belongs to the Qatari state investment authority and global property company Brookfield, has spent millions investing in community projects or offering in-kind help such as mentoring for schools.Insiders say the biggest barrier to those wanting a job in Canary Wharf is education. There is one 11-18 school on the Isle of Dogs, George Green comprehensive, my old school. When I left to go to the local authority sixth form college at 16 – not enough of us warranted the school running a sixth form – I was one of only two students to pass my maths exam at the first attempt. Yet, pre-league tables, I can’t remember anyone but the handful of us who wanted to do A-levels really making much of a fuss.Far smaller when I was there, the school prided itself on an informal approach – no uniform and often chaotic classes. One friend of mine, an undiagnosed dyslexic, remembers skipping classes to take the books home to learn the biology syllabus. It was a tough school in some ways, with discipline often an issue, but there were, as there are now, some brilliant, dedicated teachers. Now there is a far more systematic approach and a relatively new head, Jill Baker, who has introduced tougher disciplinary measures.Given these demands, it is little surprise that the teachers are grateful for any philanthropic support they can get from Canary Wharf and others. Ian Cullenbrooke, the assistant head, says trips and careers advice would be pretty much impossible without it.It is true that several George Green pupils have benefited from mentoring programmes run by firms in Canary Wharf and even impressive internships, all of which would be far harder to get outside London. Talks from local high-flying employees are popular, but the teachers recognise that while many pupils say they want to be a bankerlawyerjournalist, far fewer of them have a realistic idea of how to get there from where they now are. There are, though, still norm-defying academic success stories.Wafa Mohbubul is the school’s 17-year-old head girl and hopes to apply to read natural sciences at Cambridge. With 12 GCSE passes and a regular job looking after the elderly, she is currently deciding between a summer internship at Citibank or Morgan Stanley in Canary Wharf. The height of my Saturday job success was working for Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Marble Arch, which meant leaving the island very early in the morning to get there on time.As in the country as a whole, the biggest underachievers tend to be the white working classes. The reasons are many and complicated and Cullenbrooke, who recently taught in a comprehensive in Dagenham, saw the same trend there.Recognising that there are exceptions to any rule, he says: “Students who come from immigrant families tend to be more aspirational. You know their families have come here more recently. They’re looking for opportunity and you know they’re trying to move on and to try to achieve as highly as they can. I think that with the ‘indigenous’ communities possibly you find more entrenched levels of low aspiration.”Of all the changes on the Isle of Dogs over the past 30 years, housing is the most extreme and the thing most likely to cause a sense of despair. Once an area with the highest concentration of council houses in England, it is now one of the top 10 locations for foreign investors looking to buy London property.The difference is in the extremes: estate agent Knight Frank found that a majority of Canary Wharf tenants are from overseas and the area can still feel a bit empty at weekends. By contrast, the busiest part is still the ring of largely substandard housing sandwiched between the river and the docks, the road I used to live on.Fourteen-year-old Josh Holmes is angry about aspects of life on the island and many of the changes. He lives with his grandparents, single mum, aunt, uncle and two young cousins in a three-bedroom house near the school. “Looking at the current housing state, what they’re doing is building for the rich. They should be affordable,” he tells me. “Looking at these houses they’re building down the road from here, I’m not going to be able to afford them. My aunt’s not going to be able to afford them.”Again, high-achieving Wafa is highly unusual in liking her council accommodation. She was moved, with her parents and three younger siblings, to a four-bedroom high-rise after their last flat caught fire. “We were emergency rehomed – it was life-changing because now I see the island differently,” she says. “I love it now.”She has a view of the river from her bedroom and neighbours who include homeowners in the penthouse flats: “You’ve got many contacts, so if you’re from a very low-income family, you’ve got your neighbour who’s from a very high-income family and you can just relate and increase your network.”Howard Dawber suggests that planners are now recognising the downsides of housing policies, which, though incredibly lucrative for many, have failed to provide a big enough mix, a failure to “create the steps for people moving out of social housing into low-priced, reasonable private accommodation. We as a society need to look at that gap in the market”.Newfoundland, a high-rise currently being built with stunning views west across the Thames, for example, will have 700 new flats to rent with a gym and concierge on site. The 300-plus social tenants will be in separate lower-rise buildings in Poplar. This is to provide low-rise housing for families and to avoid the “poor back door” of some developments, but it still suggests a kind of\u0026nbspsegregation.Wood Wharf, set for completion in 2023, is a further sign of the relentless pace of change on the island. But I have rarely known a time when the skyline wasn’t filled with cranes.One woman I interviewed who works in the Canary Wharf Waitrose but refused to give her full name wants to move out of the area, partly because of the nonstop building work. She used to work in several pubs, but all were closed down and turned into lucrative private housing, she says.Local objections have stymied some new plans, however, including proposals to build 2,000 homes in 33-storey towers, plans that would have meant the loss of a garage and, more importantly, encroachment on to the Mudchute, the island’s biggest – indeed, only – large area of green space.The Mudchute, created by conveying silt and slurry from the creation of Millwall docks was one of the places I loved most growing up and residents obviously still feel the same way. People started to keep animals and grow food on the Mudchute when Canary Wharf was still a disused warehouse named after the islands that produced its fruit and vegetable cargo.A 32-acre green space was the site of a sort of riding school and some weirdly generous scheme allowed me and a handful of horse-mad girls to skip PE once a week and learn to ride. I was so proud of the subsequent certificate in secondary education in horse mastership that I kept it on my CV for years. It was also helpful when I found myself studying at Cambridge, in proving I had “posh” habits.The ramshackle place of my youth is a now a fully certified equestrian centre with prices to match. Yet entrance to the farm and fields is still free, partly financed by a highly successful nursery that offers wraparound care.The fight to call a halt to high-rise development, to say “enough” to any encroachment on this incredible green space and example of community spirit – founded in the 1970s and still going strong today – feels somehow in the same spirit as all that talk of trying to get the balance between life and work right in Wood Wharf. Vicky Strong, assistant director of the Mudchute, doesn’t live on the island, yet she understands local concerns: “When I look at Canary Wharf, I think it’s amazing – to have something so grand on your doorstep. I still feel it’s an exciting time for the Wharf, but I think it needs to stop now.”Canary Wharf is amazing. Every time I use the DLR, I marvel at the access it provides, not just to the shops and towers but to Stratford and beyond. The new Elizabeth line will make the trip to Heathrow less than 40 minutes. Yet, while the development has brought jobs and prosperity to some, the fact that poverty and deprivation have increased for those living on the island is astonishing. It’s as though the shadows cast by these feats of engineering have left such dark spaces that nobody saw what was happening inside.The Long Shadow of Canary Wharf, presented by Jane Martinson, will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4’s Archive on 4 on Saturday 21 April at 8pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2d7c1685511079f4fd4e75dd973b6980290eff7/0_38_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a3f4a326066389b19dd4189ef8196df1 2600w","title":"minimal scents smell of nothing but hypocrisy","story":"The trend for undetectable perfume and no-makeup makeup conceals a minefield of vanity and self-delusionThere are two types of cosmetics, in my analysis. Lipstick and mascara. Oh, and blusher. Hang on: and powder and eyeliner and moisturiser and perfume and hairspray. Blimey, there are loads. And styling mousse and hair dye and spray tan and unnecessary surgery. Do shaving products count? Maybe. Hats? No. Even tiny, sparkly impractical hats that don’t keep the rain off? Fascinators and tiaras and coronets and the like? No, I think we’re entering the realm of clothes and jewellery. What about stick-on sequins? And moustache wax? I’m thinking of changing my look.But there are, I still think, two types of cosmetics. You can remember it like diabetes: type one is naturally occurring and type two is something you’ve clearly done to yourself. Except, obviously, nothing is naturally occurring in the field of cosmetics. So type one is what appears to be naturally occurring (ie a lie) and type two is the open truth. Concealer on the one hand, painted nails on the other. Or actually on both, as a rule.Lipstick is generally type two: a lipsticked person is not usually claiming that’s their natural lip shade. If they were, people wouldn’t buy different lipsticks to go with different outfits, which I’m pretty sure they do. And no one thinks they’re implying that, after some nuclear mutation incident involving a chameleon in a lab, they now have the power to change their own skin pigmentation. No one impishly asks if they can also swivel their eyes independently of one another or pick up snacks with a rapidly emerging mega-tongue. Everyone accepts it’s lipstick. They might say “Nice\u0026nbsplipstick”.Cosmetic surgery, meanwhile, is obviously type one. No one’s going to say “Nice surgery”. It’s not a sign of taste and self-respect to have gone under general anaesthetic and been selectively carved to reverse what our culture considers to be the uglifying effects of getting older. It’s supposed to look like nothing has happened, even though it’s often obvious something has. So it’s rude to mention.People who get facelifts just want to look like they haven’t aged. They’ve secretly paid money to look lucky. Then again, they were lucky to have the money. But that’s why bad cosmetic surgery can make someone seem so ridiculous. The spurious claim they’re making about their biological good fortune is further undermined by the indisputable evidence that they didn’t even catch a break in their choice of surgeon.The reason I’ve been musing along these lines is that, according to a recent news report, perfume is changing cosmetic types. You’d think it was pretty solidly type two: deodorant might be type one, a denial of our inherent BO, but people who smell of perfume or aftershave aren’t seriously claiming it’s exuded organically. Ambulances would be called. Nevertheless, the latest fashion in perfumes is for them to be hardly detectable by the human nose. As Ben Gorham, one of the creators of “Elevator Music”, a minimalist scent launching this month, put it: “The idea is that its wearer is noticed, not the perfume.” Perhaps it comes with a free comedy hat.Other examples of hip new barely scented scents are “You”, for “millennials” who, according to its creator, “like scent to be personal” “Dauphine” – “The concept is extreme cleanliness,” says its designer and the godfather of the trend, first made back in 2006, “Escentric Molecule 01”, described by the New York Times as “one of the top-selling niche fragrances of all time”, though I suppose you could wear it wherever you like. These products are “the olfactory equivalent of no-makeup makeup, in which people spend hundreds of hours, and dollars, to look effortless”.To say this is a bit emperor’s new clothes is an understatement. The emperor’s stylists at least claimed their clothes were detectable by some. These perfumers are marketing substances they admit are virtually unnoticeable to everyone. They talk of bringing out people’s natural scent but, if that was appealing, minicabs wouldn’t have little Christmas trees hanging from their rear-view mirrors. Perhaps it’s all a ploy to sell more deodorant, to be applied as soon as the perfume kicks in.Another cosmetic straddling both types is hair dye. Which type of cosmetic it is seems to depend, broadly and as a generalisation (so don’t say “That’s a generalisation!” because I’ve admitted it’s a generalisation), on gender. Dyed hair on a woman is seen as type two, and on a man as type one. For women, hair-dyeing is culturally accepted as an overt cosmetic choice – in fact, it gets called “colouring”, a word that implies agency and choice. But for men, it’s simply hair dye, suggesting concealment. It’s lying about having gone grey, just as a toupee is lying about having gone\u0026nbspbald.It’s odd. Lots of men don’t like going bald or grey, ostensibly because of what it looks like. But you can very effectively change what it looks like. Yet, somehow, any attempt to make such a change is associated with shame – we’re a world away from bald men openly saying: “Yes, I went bald and I didn’t like how it looked, so now I wear this terrific wig!”There are clearly people who think being bald makes you look like a loser – but there’s a broader agreement, even among those who don’t mind baldness, that you’re an enormous loser if you try to hide it. Unless, of course, you successfully hide it, in which case you look like a winner who never had the misfortune to go bald.The type one cosmetics lie is about luck and vanity – hiding the absence of the former and the presence of the latter – and, as with all issues to do with appearance, it inevitably gets tangled up with sexism. On the surface, it seems unfair on men that there’s shame attached to them dyeing their hair when women can openly colour theirs. Underlying that, though, is the deeper unfairness that old-looking men are allowed to be newsreaders and old-looking women aren’t.So when women try to “reverse the effects of ageing”, it’s a way of coping with the patriarchy. When men do it, they’re just kidding themselves about death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5db986580c3c26867fc433eee033261e20495e/0_104_3537_2122/master/3537.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d33d37badc7a0f2c56c501aaf839d700 1240w","title":"peter kay hailed as comedy genius over car share finale","story":"Comedian takes to stage at Blackpool Opera House, which was showing finale of hit TV seriesPeter Kay delighted fans as he made a rare public appearance at a charity screening of his comedy series Car Share.The comedian, who cancelled his live tour due to “unforeseen family circumstances” in December, took to the stage at the Blackpool Opera House on Saturday evening. Kay recently announced there would be three charity screenings of his BBC show at the Opera House, each one airing a special finale to the series, as well as an entirely improvised episode.The second series of the Bafta-winning programme ended on an emotional cliffhanger last year as Kay’s character, John, failed to reciprocate the advances of his car share colleague, Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. Viewers were dismayed when he said there were no plans to pen a further series.The event was held to raise money for the Lily Foundation, which Kay previously described as “an inspiring charity” that helps to improve the lives of children with mitochondrial disease. In footage of his brief appearance posted on Twitter, Kay, 44, told the audience: “Thank you very much for supporting the Lily Foundation raising money for mitochondrial disease. Very kind of you. I appreciate it. Enjoy the last ever episode of Car Share. Don’t tell anyone the end. Or tell anyone about any hedgehogs.” Bowing as he left the stage, he added: “So thank you. Lots of love, enjoy, take care, bye-bye.” The audience had gathered in Blackpool to see a sneak preview of the final ever episode of Car Share. Car Share viewers were disappointed when Kay said he wanted to “quit while you’re ahead” last year. More than 100,000 fans signed an online petition demanding a conclusion to the series.The comedian later announced the special finale to reveal what happens next for John and Kayleigh, along with the improvised episode, Car Share: Unscripted.He had said at the time: “We were completely overwhelmed by the response and even though we’ve no plans to write a third series we knew we couldn’t end the story there.”Alison Moore, 45, said Kay appeared on stage after the interval between the episodes to a rapturous welcome.“People were shouting out that they loved him, some stood up to clap,” she told the Press Association. “He just said a few words for a couple of minutes, it was really good to see him. “He seemed really fine, relaxed and genuinely touched by the reaction he got. He’s held in such high regard up this way. It was just really good to see him.”A stream of fans took to Twitter to share their glee at the hit comic’s surprise appearance and praise the final episodes. One said the Car Share unscripted episode was “pure genius” and added that it was “a joy to see Peter on stage tonight”. Another said Kay’s appearance was “emotional” and “blew us away”. The screenings were initially announced on 29 March in what was the 44-year-old comedian’s first Twitter post since cancelling his live tour in December.He said in a statement the cancellation was due to “unforeseen family circumstances”. He added: “This decision has not been taken lightly and I’m sure you’ll understand my family must always come first.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d1de64def104912af3a34cd0af48a0050b4ebb/0_256_832_499/master/832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af884feee8e68435d3c872363f801bb 620w","title":"energy home heating uk cities geology","story":"Scientists are finalising plans to exploit the vast reservoir of warm water that fills a labyrinth of disused mines and porous rock layers underneath Glasgow. They believe this subterranean store of naturally heated water could be used to warm homes in the city. If the system proves successful, such water could then be exploited in other cities and towns across Britain, they say.The £9m project will initially involve drilling narrow boreholes filled with instruments to survey temperature, seismic activity, water flow, acidity and other variables to establish the state of the water in the rocks below the city. The aim will be to establish whether this warm water can be extracted for long periods to heat Glaswegian homes.“The rocks below Glasgow are crisscrossed with tunnels that were hewed into the rock by coalminers in the 19th and 20th century,” said Professor Michael Stephenson, the director of science at the British Geological Survey (BGS), which is funding the project. “Eastern Glasgow was once the location of some of Scotland’s busiest mines. These old, long-abandoned tunnels should now be allowing water to flow freely beneath the city.”Because the reservoir of subterranean warm water is now linked by the tunnels, engineers believe they will not have to worry that water will dry up at an inidual location when they drill a borehole.Drilling of the first test boreholes – at sites yet to be selected – is the first part of an initiative by the BGS: the creation of several UK geo-energy observatories. Where other observatories look up to the sky, these will monitor conditions underground, say scientists. One test system has been selected for Scotland: the Glasgow Geothermal Energy Research Field Site. A second has been proposed for Cheshire – where scientists want to study rock conditions to assess the possibility of using underground vaults as storage for heated water.“At present it is very hard to store energy and that is a problem when using renewable power plants – such as wind plants – which operate intermittently,” said Stephenson. “Our second borehole array, again crammed with instruments, would allow us to test the feasibility of storing water – heated by renewable power plants – and then releasing that energy later when it is needed.”Heating of homes is set to become a crucial issue, researchers have warned. The UK is on target to decarbonise electricity generation as a result of the growing numbers of renewable power plants. However, the nation is still heavily reliant on North Sea and imported natural gas to heat its homes. Combustion of these fossil fuels forms a substantial part of the carbon dioxide emissions which the UK has pledged to reduceto help limit global warming.“One solution would be to use the energy beneath our feet,” said Stephenson. “The temperature of the water that is sloshing through the old mines and in the rock layers under Glasgow is about 12C. That is not red hot, obviously. However, there is a great deal of water down there and by using heat exchangers we can turn that mass of lukewarm water into a moderate supply of very hot water which could be pumped into homes to provide hot water and heating in winter. At least that is the idea.” “Our underground observatory will determine whether it is feasible or not. It will analyse rates of replenishment, acidity, temperature and many other features. Based on that data we will know if we are on to a winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9e06dc715d10e66eca6801ac6517ae69ffd85f5/0_0_4000_2265/master/4000.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b614cdc34f55e4bf2585a2be032d7e9f 1400w","title":"fit for a king a prince harry style makeover","story":"He’s already upped his game since meeting Meghan, but what should he wear after he becomes Mr Markle? By Alex NeedhamWhen it comes to memorable outfits, few can match the impact of the Nazi uniform Prince Harry wore to a fancy-dress party in 2005. Not to mention the full-frontal nudity revealed to the world seven years later, after a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas ended up on a gossip site – “A classic case of me being too much army and not enough prince,” he said of the incident.Usually, however, Harry wears classic royal garb. There’s the blue-and-burgundy tie of his regiment, the Blues and Royals his medals and his single-breasted suit, chinos and blazer, all of which tend to be blue, like his blood. Then there’s the polo kit (like many royals, Harry looks most at home on a horse) and some undeniably impressive uniforms, such as the Blues and Royals’ tropical dress: in eye-popping Persil white, it confirms that Harry may be the best wearer of medals, a gold sash and thickly-braided epaulettes since Michael Jackson circa Dangerous.Off duty, however, Harry’s flair for style is far less certain. Despite their appearance in various fawning best-dressed lists, neither Harry nor William have that crucial sixth sartorial sense. When they’ve got a day off, they favour baggy shirts and khakis, sometimes accessorised with that modern curse, the gap-year bracelet (he is wearing an unforgivable seven in one shot). Yet that was the BM era – before Meghan.There’s no doubt that Harry has started looking sharper since La Markle came on the scene. His shirts have got crisper, his suits better-fitting, his car coats more luxurious. Even those endless blue garments have started exhibiting a bit of variation: a cobalt Everlane cashmere jumper in Wales, a cornflower coat at Christmas in King’s Lynn, a midnight-blue knitted tie with a paler blue Gieves \u0026amp Hawkes suit when announcing his engagement.None of this is going to frighten those polo horses – and that’s exactly the way Harry intends it. The royals stand for continuity, tradition and security, not waiting for the latest Vetements drop at Dover Street Market.Gert Jonkers, editor-in-chief of men’s fashion magazine Fantastic Man, is a fan of Harry’s muted style. “Prince Harry is, of course, pretty ridiculously handsome,” he says, “so I’d say everything suits him well, including the perfectly understated clothes he’s always been drawn to. He dresses a bit like a royal press release: considered and nothing to be offended by. Navy blue suits him very well, as do combinations of blue, grey and white, but I guess that’s what you do when you’re in the company of your future spouse and with the assurance that there’ll be a billion photographers awaiting you. One thing I noticed is that on a recent joint appearance, the prince wore a muted-army-green jacket, which isn’t a very lifting colour for redheads. That’s all!”Yet what if Harry had more leave to experiment in his new married life? As we demonstrate here, he could still be an ambassador for Britain in Burberry – in fact, by wearing the rainbow flag-infused check of Christopher Bailey’s final collection, he can wink to his newfound wokeness. He can still wear the classics, but why not a remixed version by Stella McCartney, whose new menswear line has all the green credentials of her womenswear? Rather than shrieking at clingfilm like his dad, he can prove his modernity by embracing the sports tech trend in a Burberry cagoule, a definite upgrade from the rain jacket he wore last October at Brockholes nature reserve in Preston. And while his grandfather sleeps in the nip (according to The Crown), Harry can indulge in some statement sleepwear by Desmond \u0026amp Dempsey.Finally, away from the paparazzi, Harry can ditch the button-downs and billowing linen shirts, and embrace his inner party animal with a Paul Smith Hawaiian shirt. He doesn’t even need to lose the bracelet – but please, Harry, confine it to just the one. And don’t even think about an armband.• Commenting on this piece?

Thanks to a new wave of “micro bags” – also known as mini, baby or even bonsai – designed by major labels such as Gucci, Fendi and Chloé, as well as lesser-known brands such as Mansur Gavriel and Simon Miller, have made their way on to the high street.And bags are not the only accessory being minimised, with smaller sunglasses and heels also outnumbering the oversized on the springsummer 2018 catwalks.Skinny cat-eye sunglasses, a favourite of model Kendall Jenner, are all over Instagram while smaller-framed sunnies are sixth on men’s fashion magazine Fantastic Man’s “official garment ranking” for spring. Women, meanwhile, are swapping their stilettos for one-inch heels, also known as “nanos”, particularly Balenciaga’s coveted Knife slingbacks.As ever, social media is partly to blame – smaller accessories tend to photograph better and stylists prefer to shoot women’s shoes in size 4 or 5.It is in the world of bags that the new minimalism is making its most visible mark on the high street. Both Zara and Topshop have seen a spike in sales of bags smaller than a cantaloupe. The highly prized £462 Le Sac Chiquito by French designer Jacquemus, one of the biggest new names in fashion, already has a waiting list after being carried by singer Rihanna. The Fendi mini purse, meanwhile, was carried in February by model Gigi Hadid and has since sold out.Sara McAlpine, the fashion features editor of Elle, describes wearers as “the cab-to-kerb woman”: “She only moves between the office and appointments. She doesn’t carry make-up. But secretly, she is keen to keep up appearances – to look like she’s in control when perhaps she’s\u0026nbspnot.”The micro bags have spawned a spike in what McAlpine calls “the secret second bag” – usually a tote, often filled with books, diaries and cosmetics, and always stuffed neatly under the desk.They are also a sign that fashion is keeping up with the economic landscape: with digital payments on the increase, and debit cards expected to overtake cash in the UK this year, we have less to carry.Mini bags might be hot, but the pricing has kept them exclusive. Chloé’s Nile bag is 13cm long but costs more than £1,000. The same designer’s black leather cross-body bag is a snip in comparison at £300, but is only a 5cm cube. “Given we can pay for things with it, my iPhone is becoming more of a bag than a phone,” says McAlpine, pointing to the rise in luxury lanyards, an embryonic trend with prices of Chaos lanyards starting at £65.Ida Petersson, womenswear buying director of Browns, says the small bag trend has been gaining momentum for the past few seasons, but that a handful of micro bags are selling out immediately: the mini Dionysus by Gucci, the Nile by Chloé, while the Jacquemus bag is gaining the cult status of the famed Chanel 2.55. At Selfridges, London-based Yuzefi mini bags have a waiting list and, says Eleanor Robinson, Selfridges’ director of accessories, they are already looking at a similar story in autumn. As Plum Sykes once wrote in Vogue, “an It bag is an It bag only if you’re unlikely to possess it”.The influence of the micro bag was felt more than two decades ago with the Fendi Baguette, so named because it tucked under your arm, but with the added irony that no Fendi wearer would ever actually eat bread. “It was foolish, a treat, anti-functional. It was the first bag that was treated like a garment,” Silvia Venturini Fendi told Vogue at the time, outlining precisely its appeal to It girls. Photographs of Paris Hilton with the bag helped sell more than 100,000 in its first year. Since then, bag sizes have waxed and waned with a particular spike for oversized totes in the noughties.If the rise of smaller heels is rooted in practicality, and tiny sunglasses are one of the few unmined trends from the 1990s, then the micro-bag trend, worn cross-body, is about status. As WB Yeats wrote in his poem, Fergus and the Druid, “Take, if you must, this little bag of dreamsUnloose the cord, and they will wrap you round” – a warming quote, but one that is unlikely to fit on any of these bags."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c97d841a2109d50db0f464ffe13d37bffa6c53ab/269_166_2403_1442/master/2403.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=05a4183546a65f6c0de350315cbad76f 1240w","title":"ghost stories review martin freeman paul whitehouse","story":"Adapted with slippery agility by Jeremy Dyson and Andy Nyman from their hit 2010 play, this collection of spooky tales expands from its stage origins to fill every corner of the screen with malevolent\u0026nbspthreats.

To be fair, though, the American’s wife is Emily Blunt, the Bafta and Golden Globe-winning British actress. A smart, stylish horror flick, A Quiet Place is Krasinski’s third film as a director, but he is best known for an eight-year stint as Jim Halpert in the US version of The Office. He and Blunt live in New York with their two daughters, aged four and one.A Quiet Place has a clever, innovative premise: the Alien-style monsters can’t see but have exceptional hearing, so the humans in the film have to be almost wordless. Are you someone who knows and loves horror\u0026nbspfilms?No. Completely the opposite, which is crazy. I never was a big horror guy, because I was just too scared. That’s the truth. Then these producers called me one day and said: “Would you ever act in a horror movie?” I said: “I don’t know, I’m kind of a scaredy cat, but if it’s a cool idea maybe.” And they said: “Well, the idea is that this family can’t make any noise and you have to figure out why.” And I thought: “That’s as good a one-liner as you can get.”As part of the online publicity for A Quiet Place, you did a skit with your wife where you called yourselves, “The Krunts”. Are you going to regret coining that?Yes! I immediately regretted that – I’m not going to lie to you. I just wish I could do better for my wife, because we could have made Bluntinski, we could have done a lot of things. But Krunt is what comes out of it. I mean, just imagine if we came back to England and had a lovely estate, we’d have to call it Krunt Manor.What do people in Britain say about The Office?One of my favourite encounters was with a customs agent who said: “Are you an actor? What would I know you from?” And I said: “The Office, but don’t worry, the American Office.” Then, as he stamped my passport, he very under his breath went: “Well, I like it better.” And I went:“NO WAY!”You beefed up a lot for the 2016 film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. What’s the best part of getting into that kind of shape?I remember Matt Damon saying this and it’s true: you pick your kids up and don’t have back pain. Like\u0026nbspnothing. You can pick them up, toss them in the air and not feel like you’re going to the hospital that night.Do you get the feeling that your wife has a preference either way?I don’t think she does, but I’m sure she wasn’t upset that I was in great\u0026nbspshape.You’re about to be the latest incarnation of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan in a new Amazon series. What’s your spin on him?Well, the whole thing for me is I’ve been a huge fan of Jack Ryan – I feel like he’s our James Bond. I mean, a lot less sex, but Bond nonetheless.So you want to play him with more sex then?No, I tried and they wouldn’t go for it. For me, he’s a character that I think resonates really well now: we’ve had so many stories about superheroes who can fly, superheroes who can shoot things out of their hands and I think to have a real person do heroic things is kind of a nice thing to put out in the world right now.You’re better qualified to talk about Paw Patrol then?Exactly, correct. That’s probably what I should do next: the reboot of Paw Patrol. That’s your headline: here comes the live-action Paw Patrol from John Krasinski.You have a reputation – in your roles and in press – of being a good guy, a gentleman. Is that important to you?Well, that’s very nice, first of all. And second, my parents definitely brought me up to carry myself without being negative, so there’s probably part of me that always wants to be a worthy son. But overall, hey, there’s worse things than being seen as the nice guy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53956c099b1fb89cba34a8ee1f2d9a8054da7e3/0_114_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3ea67125fa64a64289f8d55eed26dd1f 1240w","title":"manchester city manchester united premier league match report","story":"For a long while Manchester City had it sewn up. Or, at least, they thought they had. Blue smoke bombs were being let off. The first euphoric chants of “championees”, could be heard and the Etihad was overdosing on schadenfreude given the history of these teams and the prospect of a title-winning victory that would have meant so much in this ided city.What followed was extraordinary. Manchester United scored, quickly added another and then one more to complete an improbable feat of escapology against the Premier League’s champions-in-waiting. From 2-0 down to 3-2 up in the space of 16 second-half minutes – the game had been turned upside down and, at the final whistle, the television cameras even picked out a few home supporters in tears.Reminder: City are 13 points clear at the top of the table. Mourinho congratulated them afterwards for winning the title.It was a wild, eccentric derby and one of the stirring United comebacks from a team, in Sir Alex Ferguson’s day at least, that used to make a habit of these kind of thrilling recoveries. United, to put it bluntly, were abysmal in the first half. Vincent Kompany and Ilkay Gundogan had both scored for City and it could easily have become a rout if Raheem Sterling had not been having one of those days when he seemed to confuse the measurements of David de Gea’s goal with a particularly troublesome barn door. Sterling’s misses did not feel so consequential at the time, with City winning 2-0, but they did by the end.United certainly rode their luck bearing in mind the two incidents when penalties should have been awarded against Ashley Young – the second one, at 3-2, a studs-up lunge on the substitute Sergio Agüero that should also have resulted in a red card – but it was a triumph, ultimately, for the strength of personality within Mourinho’s team and if City defend this way against Liverpool on Tuesday their chances of reaching the Champions League semi-finals are somewhere between minimal and non-existent. This is the first time in Guardiola’s coaching career that one of his teams have conceded three goals in successive matches and Nicolás Otamendi, in particular, was badly exposed during the period of the game when Paul Pogba scored twice and Chris Smalling turned in the winner.Until that stage, Pogba was part of a midfield that was being over-run and Alexis Sánchez had found it difficult to make any kind of favourable impression.Yet the game swung on the moment, five minutes into the second half, when Gundogan’s shot flicked off the angle of crossbar and post. After that, United’s A-listers seemed to remember they were supposed to be elite performers. Pogba demonstrated his more attractive qualities and Sánchez – involved in all of his team’s goals – chose a good day to remind everyone why United made him the best-paid footballer in the land.For Guardiola, it must have been startling to see the way City unravelled once Sánchez had drawn Otamendi out to the right wing and then swivelled away from him to help create Pogba’s first goal. Ander Herrera chested Sánchez’s cross into Pogba’s path and once the Frenchman had aimed his shot beyond Ederson it was remarkable how quickly the game swung United’s way.Two minutes later, Sánchez crossed from the left and Pogba eluded Otamendi to equalise with a precise header. Smalling’s goal was another cross into the penalty area, this time from Sánchez’s free-kick, and the centre-half was completely alone as he side-footed his shot into an exposed net.For all the praise they have attracted this season, City have not actually kept clean sheets in successive home matches since September. Their vulnerabilities at the back can often be overlooked when they attack so beautifully. Yet the last two games have shown how susceptible they can be against top-level opposition and this was one occasion when Mourinho could never be accused of ultra-defensive tactics. As Jürgen Klopp said last week, sitting back is not the way to hurt City. From Mourinho, there was no parking of the bus.Guardiola chose not to blame the referee, Martin Atkinson, in his post-match analysis. Indeed, he had to ask his press officer for the referee’s name, which made a refreshing change compared to the response it might have incurred had it been Mourinho in that position. Yet there was nothing of note from City’s manager to explain why and where it went wrong and, by the final whistle, this was one of the few occasions since he Guardiola joined the club that a few supporters behind the dugout could be seen taking exception with his decisions. Only a few – but still noticeable.Guardiola had taken the calculated gamble of starting with Kevin de Bruyne on the bench. Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker were also rested with Tuesday’s game against Liverpool in mind and Guardiola resisted any temptation to fast-track the fit-again Agüero into the starting lineup. Yet it scarcely seemed to matter when Kompany powered in Sané’s corner and five minutes later Gundogan swivelled past Nemanja Matic to stab in City’s second goal.At 2-0, the mood was euphoric. City were on course to win the league with six games to spare. No side would have done it any earlier, date-wise, since United beat Blackpool 2-1 on the same day to seal the 1955-56 championship and Mourinho said afterwards it would have felt “like death” for his team’s supporters. Instead, it was the players in red celebrating a highly memorable victory and City will have to wait until next weekend, at the earliest, to wrap up their third title in seven years.More likely, it will need a little longer, given the chances of United losing at home to West Bromwich Albion.An exhilarating high had turned into an excruciating low, and vice versa. “Wow”’ Guardiola said. “How could we lose that game?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fc65808ba5c259dfa635e60fd906d88014eb1a6/0_81_2984_1791/master/2984.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3f12e57f791eee5ccb2bec45d002acce 1240w","title":"manchester city pep guardiola united liverpool","story":"Forget the league title for a moment.\u0026nbspThis was an object lesson in why Manchester City are going to struggle to keep Liverpool’s players off the\u0026nbspscoresheet when the\u0026nbspChampions League quarter‑final\u0026nbspresumes on Tuesday.At the moment City require four goals to go through – should Liverpool score they will need at least five – and allowing a feeble Manchester United back into this game from a position where they should have been dead and buried\u0026nbspwill have done nothing for their confidence.Even with a weakened side City were so far ahead in the first half it was embarrassing. United were doing nothing to stop David Silva finding space to run the game and must have been grateful to arrive at half-time only a couple of goals in arrears. The visitors, a bit like City at Anfield in midweek, looked as if they could play all day without scoring – until two goals in two minutes from Paul Pogba wiped the smiles from the faces of the champions-elect.Both were created by Alexis Sánchez, both involved misjudgments from Nicolás Otamendi. The defender strayed out of position to try to dispossess Sánchez by the touchline, only to be left spectating when the Chilean executed a neat turn and sent the ball into the box. Moments later Sánchez found a pocket of space on the opposite flank and sent in a diagonal cross for Pogba, who got goalside of Otamendi and placed a\u0026nbspheader just inside Ederson’s right-hand upright.Either this was the most cunning of gameplans from José Mourinho, using the first half to lull City into a false sense of security, or the home side had once again shown their propensity to crack under very little pressure. If Pep Guardiola’s side are this fragile playing at home against neighbours who spent the first half seemingly content to witness a coronation, they are not going to last much longer when the going gets tough in the Champions League.To say the first half gave no hint of what was to follow would be to risk the understatement of the season. After the chasing they were given on Merseyside, City found themselves invited to relax in Manchester, largely due to the fact that United these days are far too languid to resemble\u0026nbspLiverpool even remotely.The reason the best team in the country swept to a two-goal lead with their best players left on the bench was because United allowed them to play their normal game. Liverpool had denied them that luxury in the Champions League but here City were able to build from\u0026nbspthe back, cross the halfway line\u0026nbspwith impunity and patiently attempt to pick a way through the retreating red shirts.With players such as David Silva and Raheem Sterling in their side City were always likely to be able to unlock a defence that kept funnelling backwards when the ball was lost, and the opening goal was a case in point. While it might have come from a set piece, Vincent Kompany planting the firmest of headers past David de Gea from Leroy Sané’s corner, the corner itself came from City winning the ball back in midfield and working it quickly towards goal. Sterling lost possession near the centre circle but tenaciously worked to regain it and from then on United could only counter quick passing and movement from Silva and Sané by putting the ball out of play.Until that point there had been some doubt as to whether Guardiola might have to call upon Kevin De Bruyne or Kyle Walker to inject creativity and pace, though United did not change their approach on going behind and the home side were two up within five minutes, Ilkay Gündogan ultimately making the most of a poor clearance from De Gea that merely invited Sané to set up another attack. It is no exaggeration to say City could have been five goals up by the interval and that Sterling could have had a first-half hat-trick, though as the Etihad knows only too well the England winger is not that reliable\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspfinisher.It was the usual story when Sterling missed his first big opportunity. The pass from Silva that put him clear was just too good, it gave him too much time and, with Antonio Valencia thundering in on his left, Sterling dithered a moment too long and scooped his shot wastefully over the bar. The next chance also came from Silva and once again Sterling could not keep his shot on target.

Now it’s a test of masculinity fuelled by cheap airfares and alcohol. Sirin Kale hears about those who lost so much more than just a night’s memoriesReturning to his Ibizan hotel room, the stag notices that his best man is missing. Mike Rutter last saw Luke Rhoden when he put him to bed, after Rhoden suffered an adverse reaction to cocaine and ecstasy. Rhoden’s bed has been made. His shoes are lined up. Knowing instantly that something is wrong, Rutter begins calling his friend. As the call disconnects, Rutter turns around and sees the hotel manager standing in the doorway. His stomach rolls away from him, bouncing like a coin down Balearic cobblestones.“The last thing I said to him,” Rutter tells me, “was ‘Go to bed and sleep. If you need me, ring me.’ So that was the last time… yeah.” He trails off.After being put to bed, Rhoden jumped from a balcony. Observers described him as frightened and hallucinating. Police officers, apprehending him, pushed a plastic baton into his neck. Rhoden died. In 2016, a British coroner recorded that the cause of death was asphyxiation caused by the excessive restraining methods adopted by officers, as well as the drugs in his system.Back home, Rutter got married without his best man. “It was very difficult, to be honest,” he tells me. “It was a different wedding, let’s just say that.”For a long time, Rutter was haunted by the fact that he wasn’t there when Rhoden died. “I nearly lost everything,” he explains. “Bad depression. Counselling. There was a lot of guilt.”What happens when your stag do ends in tragedy? The loss spreads outwards, like a blight: contaminating everyone who comes into contact with it. “It takes a toll on the people around you. You end up treating people like shit. Wife like shit, kids like shit, everyone around you like shit.”All nine men on Rutter’s stag weekend have been affected. “Every single person in the group has struggled,” Rutter tells me. “To the point where one of the lads has moved to Australia. He just had to get away.”I first became aware of the horrifying trend of British men dying on stag dos when a girlfriend whispered in shocked tones of a man we knew who had gone on a stag weekend. By the time they went to wake the stag up in the morning, he couldn’t be roused. He was dead.To me, this seemed to be an astonishing and exceptional tragedy, but the more I researched, the more I realised that it was not. Although UK coroners’ courts don’t collate data on whether deaths are stag-do related, at least 30 British men have died in the past decade alone while on stag dos. Others have suffered life-changing injuries. And fatalities seem to be increasing: about a third of deaths over the past decade took place in 2017.Typically, the victims are men from tight-knit communities: family men, with partners or children. They have steady jobs and often play team sports. Many deaths happen overseas, in stag party hotspots, such as Budapest, Magaluf, Hamburg or Ibiza. Often victims don’t have travel insurance and fundraising pages for repatriation costs are necessary. “Bring Watson home to his family,” reads one. “An amazing guy deserves an amazing send-off.”The deaths I tracked fell, broadly, into three categories. There’s death by misadventure: often related to alcohol or drug abuse. Men die of heart failure after drug binges that leave them car-jacking vehicles, or they drink so much they die of alcohol poisoning. Balcony falls merit their own sub-category: typically, men try to climb back into their rooms while drunk. One Ibizan hotel, the Pisces Park, is notorious for stag-do balcony deaths – two British men died this way in 2015. The second category is death by suspicious causes, such as Rhoden’s death at the hands of police. Then there’s death by brute bad luck unrelated to stag-do activity: undiagnosed heart conditions, or blood clots.A covenant of silence, forged in party capitals around Europe, persists around stag dos. What happens on tour, stays on tour. But when men die on stag weekends, silence becomes codified into omertà. People don’t want to talk about the fatalities: interview requests fall on deaf ears.Sometimes, families are ashamed of the circumstances in which their loved ones died. “You don’t want people thinking bad things about your son,” explains one mother over the course of a tearful phone call.For others, the grief pounds as strongly as a new hangover. “I hate talking about Paul’s passing – it just makes me too sad,” writes the Racing Post columnist Steve Palmer, whose best man, Paul Bush, died on his stag weekend. Palmer sends me the column he wrote after Bush died. “Returning from Budapest with an empty seat beside me on the plane was a soul-destroying experience. I was due to get married just five days later, something I considered almost impossible… A week after the worst day of my life, came the best.”I make inquiries, pushing into people’s grief. As I’m writing, news breaks that a 29-year-old Scot named Liam Colgan is missing. Liam is his brother Eamonn’s best man and was last seen in Hamburg’s Reeperbahn district, an area popular with stag parties. When I speak to Eamonn, it’s been two days since Liam’s disappearance, and he’s returning home. He sounds weary.“I’m beyond worried,” Eamonn says. “It’s totally out of character for Liam to go missing. He doesn’t use drugs or anything like that. Obviously, he was under the influence of alcohol quite heavily, as anyone would be on a stag do. But for him not to have any contact with anyone…”Eamonn trails off, panic edging into his voice. “He doesn’t have his passport. He’s missed his flight.”Many cultures have rituals by which boys become men. In Brazil, male initiates to the Sateré-Mawé tribe plunge their arms into gloves full of stinging bullet ants. Afterwards, they are welcomed by the tribe, as men.Like the men of the Sateré-Mawé tribe, Brits are also expected to demonstrate their masculinity through the complicated and often costly ritual of the modern stag do. Dentist’s chairs – a game where you sit and have alcohol free-poured directly down your throat – were banned in the UK in 2010 as part of a package of proposals aimed at tackling binge drinking. However, they remain popular in many European stag hotspots. In 2013, a British man, Paul Tobutt, died at his own stag party in Benidorm, after playing the game. Sateré-Mawé men suffer trial by venomous ants British men endure trial by dentist’s chair. Both practices are likely to prove poisonous and painful.It wasn’t always like this. The modern British stag do as a performance of masculinity exploded in the late 2000s, with the advent of cheap airfares to European capitals – where alcohol is cheap, strip-clubs are plentiful and beer is super-strength. Films such as 2009’s The Hangover captured the spirit of this emerging phenomenon, and reinforced the narrative that a stag do isn’t a stag do unless something stupid or dangerous happens.“A generation ago, the stag night would have been the groom and some friends down the local pub,” says Dr Thomas Thurnell-Read, lecturer in cultural sociology at Loughborough University. Now, stag dos are a ritual of male friendship. “The stag passes from unmarried man to married man. The cultural urge to mark that transition causes all the hedonistic and ostentatious behaviour you see on stag weekends.”Reckless behaviour, as well as excessive alcohol consumption, is part of the tradition. “There’s this emphasis on ritualistically punishing the stag for this change of status. You humiliate him with fancy dress and make him get drunk,” Thurnell-Read says.Above all, the group takes precedence. “Being seen to not be drinking is an affront to the male-bonding ritual, to the idea we’re all in this together,” says Thurnell-Read. During his fieldwork in Krakow, Thurnell-Read witnessed men furtively tipping drinks into plant-pots, rather than admit to the group they didn’t want to drink any more.I want to know how stag do antics can devolve into dangerous behaviour. In a London pub, I meet 35-year-old Kit. He’s a veteran of more than 20 stag dos. “This is how people can die on stag dos,” he says casually. “When you’re in a group of guys, you regress back to how you were as boys. And there’s an amount of peacocking involved. You’re always egging someone on.”On a recent stag weekend in Hamburg, Kit witnessed a stag – dressed in a hamburger outfit – climbing a telegraph pole. “We’re chanting: ‘Have you ever seen a burger up a pole?’ So he’s like, fuck it. It’s 30ft and he’s pissed. Everyone’s chanting. Falling from that height, he definitely would have died.”Kit sips his drink. “But you don’t want to be the guy who spoils it. That’s why no one wanted to stop it being dangerous.”These often extreme stag dos offer up a romanticised version of male friendship but by contrast they also result in violence or injury. When masculine ideals are collectively being performed by groups of drunk men, it’s easy for things to go wrong.James Thorpe, 29, knows this first-hand. After breaking his neck on his own stag weekend in Magaluf in 2016, the former firefighter is now in a wheelchair. “I suppose a little bit of stupidity was involved,” Thorpe remembers. “We’d had a couple of drinks and saw some friends swimming and we were trying to get into the spirit of it, so we went for a swim. I’m not quite sure if I tripped or ed – I can’t remember. But I banged my head on the sea bed and broke my neck.”Luckily, a friend dragged Thorpe out of the water. “If they hadn’t found me within the next 30 seconds, I’d probably have drowned.”Since his accident, life has changed dramatically. “Day-to-day stuff is difficult. Getting yourself up is an effort getting dressed is an effort. I still have dark days, but I’m starting to get my independence back.”Despite everything, Thorpe would go on another stag do. “I haven’t changed my mind on stag dos,” he tells me. “They do have the potential to get out of hand, when you’ve got that laddish behaviour, a bit of peer pressure and showing off. That’s where they tend to go wrong. But I’d still go on one.” He laughs. “I probably wouldn’t return to Magaluf, though. Too many bad memories.”Messing around near water has proved fatal for other British stags. In 2015, 24-year-old Dale Joint drowned on his stag do after jumping into the water near moored boats in Salthouse Docks, Liverpool.“Until it touches you, you don’t really think about it,” his aunt, Gaynor Isherwood, tells me. “In one fell swoop, a night out ends up with this. It’s hard to take in.” After Joint died, Isherwood says, she felt like she’d been hit by a bus – and finally understood what that metaphor means. “He was just larking around with his mates.”Isherwood feels that not enough has been done to prevent similar accidents taking place at the docks. After we speak, I go online. “The recently renovated Albert Dock area is an ideal place to start any stag night out,” I read.Not all deaths are down to drunken misadventure. Sometimes, nefarious or criminal factors are at work. “Being in a foreign city tends to make people vulnerable,” Thurnell-Read says. “Especially if you’re in fancy dress. You’re very obvious. If anyone wants to mug or attack some foreigners, they stand out.”When men die on stag dos, it’s easy for them to be victim-blamed. No Ibizan civil guard officers have been charged with Rhoden’s unlawful killing. “They kicked it under the carpet,” Luke’s father, Norman, tells me. “They said it was a done deal, an accidental death. People think: ‘Oh well, it’s just a stag do, he had too much to drink.’”Entire economies are propped up by stag-do tourism. When money’s involved, there’s a vested interest in the authorities downplaying deaths. Justice may be a long time coming, or may not come at all.I speak to David Swindle, a private investigator working on the case of Craig Mallon, killed from a single punch on a Spanish stag weekend in 2012. “Numerous evidential opportunities weren’t pursued,” Swindle explains. “There hasn’t been the level of investigation we’d expect. And there’s a wider issue about a lack of support by the British government for the families of murder victims abroad.”“I’ve realised that my son’s death was just a drop in the ocean,” Norman agrees. “There’s big money involved. And what’s happening isn’t highlighted enough. As quickly as it happens, it’s forgotten. It’s only the people who were around that remember. I’ll be chatting to people I know, and they’ll say: ‘My boy’s off to Ibiza… Oh, sorry I didn’t realise.’ That’s how quickly they forget.”It’s a brutal alchemy, when men die on stag dos: a life-affirming celebration combusts into death. Tough questions need to be asked. What is it about our society that requires men to perform masculinity according to rigid protocols that result in physical injury or worse? And why do we laud men for adhering to these rituals? I read one satirical article that sums up this approving spirit: “Prince Harry’s stag do likely to end in at least one death.”Liam Colgan is still missing. Eamonn returned to Hamburg to search for him. “The wedding won’t go ahead without Liam,” he tells me. “We have to find him soon and get him home.”While some search for their loved ones, and others fight the authorities for justice, for those left back home, life returns to normal – almost. “Everything changes. It’s a different life,” Mike Rutter tells me. “It doesn’t matter what you do. He’s not coming back. That’s probably the worst part.”Rutter is back at the boxing gym that he and Luke Rhoden used to frequent. For a long time, he stayed away. “I couldn’t go back. I’m back now. I’ve gone back to boxing, finally. It’s good. Things are good.”For reasons he can’t even fully understand, Rutter has started racing motorbikes. “Luke always used to say this phrase: ‘Life’s for living.’ And for some reason I’ve started racing motorbikes. I don’t even know why. People say it’s stupid, but life is short.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/857b5eda35227c493f812b84717685bc7ca92b86/0_74_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7829ddb177622040a3513413309666aa 2600w","title":"smart ideas times two a home that marries old and new","story":"Affordable designer touches give this London flat a distinctive edgeDean Louw and Rafael Borrego are partners in life as well as business, which means spending a certain amount of time together. “It was 24 hours a day, which took a bit of adjusting to,” Dean says, in the living room of the flat the couple share in Stockwell, south London. He’s sitting on a Saba dining chair, at a large round table he and Raf made themselves, using legs from Pretty Pegs and a piece of glass-topped stained oak. “You have to respect each other, and learn not to tread on each other’s toes.”They now have a son, which means that one of them has to stay home while the other goes to the gym. The 24 hours have been brought down to a more manageable 23.The business, on the other hand, keeps moving forward. For the past 10 years the couple have acted as a kind of one-stop shop for residential property. They’ve bought houses to fix up and sell on, developed larger multi-unit sites, and advised on interiors for clients. Dean, originally from South Africa, who trained and worked as a chartered accountant for many years, provides the numerical rigour. Raf, an architect who was born in the Canary Isles, brings the creativity. Raf says Dean keeps his feet on the ground, while Dean says that without his input, Raf would blow the budget every time.From the outside, their flat, which occupies the ground and basement floors at No 9, looks exactly the same as No 3. Both frontages are noticeably smarter than the others on the road, with teal paint and black tracery. It’s not an accident: having renovated their own home (they let out two flats upstairs), the developers saw the house for sale down the road and bought it, decorating the exterior in the same style.For their new project, however, they have taken their design nous and made it available to the general public. RB12, which opened in February in Shoreditch Village – a former timber yard that has been converted into a shopping and dining area – is a showroom spread over two floors and featuring designs for every room in the home. The idea is to lay things out in a relaxed, informal manner.“We’re trying to do more of a homey showroom than a furniture shop,” says Raf. “Things don’t look too different there from how they are here.”And a tour of their living room, the pride and joy of the flat, reveals that many of the items are from brands on display in the showroom, such as floor lamps by Czech firm Brokis and a rug by Armadillo \u0026amp Co. At the end of the room sits a Quilt sofa by Saba, which looks like it would be an easy place in which to lose a quiet afternoon. “Often beautiful sofas aren’t comfortable, but Saba really focuses on comfort, too,” Dean says.For several brands RB12 is the exclusive UK distributor, in some cases the result of relationships forged during the dark years of the recession, when designers couldn’t afford to be as fussy about who they sold to.“We started doing up properties shortly after the crash in 2008, so many of the suppliers who wouldn’t normally work with iniduals were prepared to sell to us,” says Dean. The kitchen, for example, comes from Minacciolo, a family-run Italian business specialising in eco-friendly, industrially inspired designs.Not that they are above more quotidian designers. There’s an Ikea storage unit in the kitchen and a vase from Habitat sits in the living room underneath sculptures by Javier S Medina, a Spanish artisan whose work took off recently when Sarah Jessica Parker bought a piece. The large bright yellow sofa, which dominates one side of the living room, is from the Conran Shop.“We like to mix it up, with cheaper items alongside the more expensive ones,” Dean explains. Their large master bathroom downstairs is a case in point. “The tiles are really quite cheap, which lets us have the concrete finish on the walls, which is more expensive.“I think people sometimes struggle with how to visualise a space, or see how things will work together,” he adds. “For example, a lot of people would never put pink and orange together, and play it safe with a magnolia or off-white instead. But if you find the right tones they can go together very well. You can give a room a lot of character by choosing colours with confidence.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f9fbe78e0bce6422e688e11fd91f742ac51ee0e/400_223_2460_1477/master/2460.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b0440b9de2ec9877175b03a52d735c9c 1240w","title":"i started my business from scratch and now work two weeks a month","story":"Social media entrepreneur reckons he’s earned £250,000 simply by taking private jet charters on frequent holidaysI started my social media consultancy business from scratch at the age of 17, selling\u0026nbsptargeted advertising space on social media sites like Facebook.

There’s no queuing and you get driven right from the plane door to immigration. I must save at least six hours of my time per round trip. That’s important to me, because I tend to work incredibly hard when I’m not on holiday, typically putting in a 10- to 15-hour day.I must have taken 45 or 50 flights in the past year to 30 different places. I like to go skiing or visit Paris, Milan and new places – I love immersing myself in new cultures. I don’t own my own jet I pay for a membership service that enables me to get seats on private charters. I see the expense as cost-neutral because I often meet other CEOs and business leaders onboard.

She loved that.Home is a three-bed apartment on the cliffs near Poole in Dorset. I live alone, except for my English springer iel, Charlie. I must spend £200 to £300 a month on her. When I take her on a walk to my local pub, I’ll buy her a cooked steak – no sauce.I’ve got a six-figure sum invested in cryptocurrencies, and it’s not uncommon for me to make around £1,000 overnight. I’ve made around £60,000 to £70,000 in total although I lost £7,000 recently when bitcoin fell back.I have two buy-to-let properties I own which pay my mortgage, and I’m about to take on a third one. And I do guaranteed rentals I rent, say, a three-bed home and pay £1,500 a month to the landlord guaranteed for five years, then I make it an HMO (house of multiple occupation) doing things like changing the lounge into a bedroom and earning more than the £1,500 rent.Recently, I bought a £12,000 jet ski. I also bought a £70,000 Porsche. I traded in another car I owned to get the Porsche, so it actually only cost me about £10,000 upfront.

We meet seven musicians whose innovative sounds are liberating the genre for new audiencesby  Kate Hutchinson. Photographs by  Antonio Olmos for the ObserverEvery so often, British jazz pops its head above the parapet, gets a Mercury nomination, and has a noodle on telly to remind everyone that it’s still there, like it’s always been, parping away from mainstream view. For many of us, jazz has seemed like something other people listened to. But in the past few years, the genre has had a serious overhaul. When Kendrick Lamar released his landmark album To Pimp a Butterfly in 2015, one of its most extraordinary aspects was its liberal use of jazz, which dovetailed with hip-hop and opened it up for a new generation. Not only did it immediately feel more accessible but, played by the likes of strikingly cosmic characters such as Thundercat and Kamasi Washington, it looked commandingly cool.In the UK, a new and thrilling jazz movement has evolved. As with Lamar, Thundercat and Washington, it is born out of fresh experimentalism, is reaching far younger, more erse audiences and doesn’t care for snootiness. Unlike in previous waves, these musicians are in their 20s and early 30s, come from erse backgrounds and, as with grime, have created their own community outside of major labels and concert halls. Their music, meanwhile, pulls liberally from other genres, whether hip-hop, neo-soul, UK club sounds such as broken beat, or from the African and Caribbean diaspora. And it’s not just at gigs that you can hear it but, much like in the acid jazz days, nightclubs too. British DJs such as Bradley Zero and Floating Points have liberated jazz for the dancefloor to the extent that it’s now not unheard of for a 10-minute Pharaoh Sanders odyssey to be spun on the decks to an appreciative, twentysomething crowd.Notable, too, is how prolific this wave is, with jazz musicians infiltrating summer music festival listings, signing to indie labels or taking their sound abroad. The sheer volume of talent is being recognised across the world. “Wherever I’m travelling, whether it’s in the States, Argentina, Japan, or all over Europe, everyone is talking to me about the British invasion,” says DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson, who himself helped usher in the acid jazz sound of the mid-80s. “I’ve had people talking about Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson in slightly hushed tones, but I’ve never had this before. They feel this is a very important movement.”The movement hasn’t just sprung out of nowhere. In London especially there is the sense that today’s jazz musicians have come up together over the past few years. They are collaborative, constantly threading through one another’s projects, and jamming together at a number of DIY stomping grounds, including the Church of Sound in an east London chapel and Dalston’s Total Refreshment Centre. South of the river, where much of the capital’s abundant scene has coalesced, music nights Steez and weekly Afrofuturism session Steam Down – recently attended by Kamasi Washington – are where players team up and try out new material. Broadcaster Teju Adeleye says: “The artists don’t feel like inaccessible superstars, they come to all the gigs and jam nights.”Adeleye is one of the new crop of radio hosts who are supporting jazz’s rising stars on internet stations such as NTS and Worldwide FM. “Having affordable spaces where people can go and experiment in front of audiences is important,” she says. “It fosters something genuine in a city where so much is driven by corporate ventures.” Also crucial are the jam sessions and artist development charities that have nurtured many of the new wave. These include Tomorrow’s Warriors, at London’s Southbank Centre, whose ethos is to support the development of jazz newbies, especially women and musicians of colour. It’s an ethos shared by Jazz re:freshed, Justin McKenzie and Adam Moses’s promotions company turned label, which has played a huge part in supporting new jazz, whether giving musicians a stage in the UK or overseas.Perhaps what’s most exciting, though, is the sense that this generation is wresting jazz from its gatekeepers and making it their own. With this scene, says Adeleye, “not everyone is classically or formally trained”, and as a result “there’s an accessible, anti‑hero energy that feels like sweet vindication for a music that should be for everyone, but has felt locked away and preserved only for a few. They’ve liberated the sound.”Soweto Kinch, an established saxophonist who runs Birmingham-based jam session The Live Box, agrees. “Genre boundaries are more fluid,” he says. “There’s less kowtowing to the jazz police.” The UK’s next-gen jazzers have an important confidence and it’s bolstered by the fact that their audience want to hear something original. It’s why Kinch hopes this jazz wave won’t end up being a wave at all, but will be here to stay: “It’s music of quality and of longevity it’s not disposable new music,” he says. Peterson agrees: “This lot are all doing original music, and that’s a really important sign. The last thing jazz needs is another version of Summertime or Feeling Good. Just make original music – that’s what people want.”London-based drummer, composer and producer, 26“I’ve been in Cape Town and people are talking about what’s going on here,” says Moses Boyd of the London jazz scene, which he has played a central role in shaking up and making new over the past few years. “In New York and at South by Southwest, people stop me in the street and show interest. It’s definitely a good time.”You can hear this very clearly in Boyd’s 2017 solo EP Absolute Zero, which fuses live jazz drumming with synthesised sounds and grime rhythms. Even his more straightforward jazz tracks have the potential to fill dancefloors. When he recorded Rye Lane Shuffle in 2016, Boyd sent it to his mentor Sam Shepherd, AKA DJ and producer Floating Points. “Before I knew it, Sam had cut a dubplate and was sending me videos of him spinning it across the world. Suddenly my inbox was filling with DJs asking, ‘Where can I get this?’ That was a big shift for me.”These days Boyd is surrounded by jazz musicians with a similarly open-minded approach to genre and process, but 10 years ago, when he started playing around London, things felt very different. “There was a big audience but it wasn’t really people like me. The jazz world felt very separate.”Touring with Soweto Kinch and meeting Gilles Peterson helped Boyd find his own way. “Seeing how Gilles used jazz in club culture, the dots all started to connect for me. I was like, ‘there is a place for the music I’ve been hearing in my head’. Because it’s easy to get disillusioned: maybe it’s just me, maybe I’m in the wrong country, maybe I’m some alien planted here. But gradually it started to click.”Another big influence on the current sound, Boyd says, is London itself and its vibrant sound‑system culture. “I think London is a unique place, a very culturally integrated place,” he says. “You walk down the street and hear 10 different languages being spoken and that’s not strange. That definitely seeps into the music.”Interview by Killian FoxMoses Boyd plays at the Love Supreme jazz festival, Glynde, East Sussex, 29 June-1 July London-based bandleader and saxophone and clarinet player, 33Shabaka Hutchings is easily one of the most interesting bandleaders of the past decade. He deals in shape-shifting sax and clarinet, but it’s his carefree approach to other genres that’s established him as a musical outlier who’s rattling rigid jazz traditions. His three projects, Shabaka and the Ancestors, Sons of Kemet and The Comet Is Coming – the latter a nominee in the Mercury’s “token jazz category”, he jokes – are peppered variously with calypso, dub, Afrofuturist beats and hat-tips to Sun Ra, Miles Davis and sweat‑soaked New Orleans party music.Trumpeter and Gondwana label boss, Matthew Halsall, calls Hutchings “the Kamasi Washington of the UK jazz scene” and it’s easy to see why. Hutchings – who is from Birmingham by way of Barbados, where he lived till he was 16 – is a similarly gifted brass player, has a commanding presence, and comes with a penchant for all things cosmic. He is also as ubiquitous, having played with the likes of mid-00s breakthroughs Melt Yourself Down, Ethio-jazz pioneer Mulatu Astatke and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, on the latter’s soundtrack for Paul Thomas Anderson’s film The Master.Hutchings is also helping to document the scene, and last month oversaw We Out Here, a compilation that spotlights south London’s rising stars. He gathered together Maisha, Ezra Collective, Moses Boyd, Theon Cross, Nubya Garcia, Triforce, Joe Armon-Jones and Kokoroko and recorded them over three days of jamming last year. He says of these musicians that, much like him, “the differences in the generation now and generations past is that it feels like young musicians aren’t trying to satisfy the standards that were set by jazz in the past. They’re just going, ‘What is the music that represents me today?’”This generation are bringing with them a younger audience, though it tickles Hutchings because, at 33, he’s old enough to remember “the time where jazz wasn’t cool at all. If you said, ‘I play jazz’, people were just like, ‘Oh no, that’s terrible’.” But he suggests that jazz will continue to innovate regardless of trends. Like punk, “it’s an attitude of, ‘Fuck it, we’re doing something that’s probably not going to be popular anyway’. Jazz is that music that no one’s expecting to go anywhere, and the musicians are just getting on with it.”Interview by Kate HutchinsonYour Queen Is a Reptile by Sons of Kemet is out now on Impulse!If there is a movement happening in the UK, says Sheila Maurice-Grey, then it’s not limited to jazz alone, it’s a “new wave of British culture”. The 27-year-old trumpeter and visual artist grew up in Vauxhall, south-west London, her mother from Sierra Leone, her father from Guinea Bissau and her stepfather from South Africa and Zimbabwe. She says that heritages such as hers – “this idea that I’m British, but I’ll never be classed as English” – is “what’s adding to the scene everyone keeps talking about”. She and her peers are changing things up because they are “taking from different aspects of their culture and making it a British thing”.Maurice-Grey was encouraged to pick up her instrument by the late Mat Fox, who as well as being her music teacher also ran the carnival band-style youth project Kinetika Bloco. She was inspired to hold her own masterclasses as part of Kinetika, called Bloco Lates, because “it’s important to always be aware of the people coming behind you”. Kinetika is also where the west African influences in her band, Kokoroko, have come from. She met their percussionist, Onome Ighamre, during a musical project in Kenya and the two were “complaining to each other that there are so many Afrobeat bands in the UK that perform for people that don’t look like us”. They decided to start a group to challenge that and represent “the idea of being young, black and British”.Yazmin Lacey didn’t exactly elbow her way into a career as a singer of smoky, soulful jazz music she had to be enticed. Growing up in a musical family in east London, she had a strong singing voice but never felt inclined to show it off. Shortly after moving to Nottingham in 2013, she let her guard down. “I’d had a lot to drink,” she laughs. “Someone persuaded me to sing. Then this girl came over and said, ‘Oh my gosh, I run this acoustic night, do you want to perform?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, take my number.’Gradually, while working at a children’s charity by day, Lacey built up a repertoire and a following. Performing at a night organised by Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings brought her to the attention of Future Bubblers, the label’s talent discovery scheme, and she was accepted on to the year-long development programme in 2015. It connected her with like-minded musicians and set her up to release an assured, richly melodic EP called Black Moon last summer. A second EP, 90 Degrees, is out on 19 May.Though her music blurs genres, including R\u0026ampB, soul, reggae and even garage, the 29-year-old feels especially connected to the resurgent British jazz scene – she cites Ezra Collective, Nubya Garcia and Shabaka Hutchings as inspirations. “I think there’s an undercurrent of everybody speaking their truth now,” she says, “and for me that’s what jazz means. It’s rebellion music, there are no rules. You sing from the heart, tell the stories that are real, say what you see, what’s going on in society. There’s a strength in that.”She finds strength, too, in collaborating with other musicians. “My guitarist said something that really stuck with me: when it was just the two of us, the music sounded so lonely and delicate, but play the same song now with a band and it sounds really powerful. That’s jazz in action: people connecting and talking about what’s real.” KFManchester-based trumpeter, composer, arranger and bandleader, and founder of  Gondwana Records, 34Manchester may be best known for its wayward rave days, but Matthew Halsall has more recently helped to put the city on the jazz map. A trumpeter from the age of six, he grew up in a mill town near Wigan and balances music-making with running Gondwana Records, the label he started 10 years ago to capture the cross-pollination of jazz with hip-hop, trip-hop, classical and electronic styles that was happening live on stage at a Manchester haunt called Matt \u0026amp Phred’s.The venue was a hub for acts such as the Cinematic Orchestra, hosting jam sessions where Halsall, now 34, was able to play alongside local A-listers including Nat Birchall, Jon Thorne and Chip Wickham. Inspired by their shared sensibilities, he began building his own collective, explaining how “all the early Gondwana releases were the same group of Manchester’s most interesting musicians performing together on each other’s records”.The sound they’ve developed references the ruminative approach of John and Alice Coltrane – but it’s also distinctively northern and, says Gilles Peterson, “beautifully delicate”.“Someone wrote that it has a ‘rain-stricken spiritual jazz feel to it’,” says Halsall. “It’s definitely different to the London scene. In some ways it’s more mellow and floaty. The people I work with are quite spiritual and into meditation, and a lot of them live in the countryside, so they are very chilled out.”Meditation in particular, he says, is “ingrained in the music”, Halsall having attended the Maharishi Free School in West Lancashire, which teaches a “consciousness-based education”. These days, though, he is “more interested in the exciting movement of a larger number of people”, adding that jazz has “always been greater than the sum of its parts”. It’s why he started the Gondwana Orchestra, an official ensemble of his regular players, who’ll be performing as part of the label’s 10th anniversary festival at London’s Roundhouse in October, alongside established minimalists Portico Quartet and north African‑inspired Norwich newcomers Mammal Hands, who have also recently released music on the label.Back in Manchester, Halsall says, there is a “massive demand” for jazz, with his early discovery and last year’s Mercury prize nominees GoGo Penguin due to play the city’s Albert Hall in November. And it continues to evolve, too. “The hip-hop scene in Manchester has brought in a lot of jazz recently, and when I go out on weekends it’s amazing now how many DJs will be playing jazz records.” Being a hometown hero, even an unassuming one in a flat cap and cardigan, does he get stopped on the street? “Yeah, yeah I do,” he says. “You wouldn’t think that was possible in the jazz world. But people are really into it now.” KHGondwana 10 is at the Roundhouse, London NW1, on 10 OctoberWhen Theon Cross was eight, his parents signed him and his brother Nathaniel up for brass lessons at school in Nunhead, south London. Nathaniel chose the trombone, and now he’s a prominent trombonist on the London jazz scene. Theon, meanwhile, picked up a French horn. Later he progressed to the euphonium and eventually, when he was big enough to grapple with it, a tuba. Now Cross’s tuba playing underscores some of most exciting UK jazz records of the past few years, including Rye Lane Shuffle by Moses Boyd and the last two albums by Sons of Kemet, as well as his own highly accomplished Aspirations EP from 2015.The largest and lowest-pitched member of the brass family may seem an odd presence on a London jazz stage – you’re far more likely to see it in marching bands or classical orchestras – but Cross reminds me that “the tuba was actually the first bass in jazz. When they were recording for gramophones, the tuba was the only instrument loud enough to be picked up, so they used it instead of the double bass. It’s been at the forefront right from the start.”Now Cross is making it a fixture of the new London jazz sound. “It’s an anchor for music, it’s got so much power,” he says. “I’m quite a reserved, quiet guy and I’m amplified by that instrument.” Recently he’s been playing with the London rapper Kano, who features a brass section in his live show. “When I come out at Glastonbury with my tuba, people are like, ‘What’s that about?’ But when they hear me doubling the bassline, they’re like,” – he widens his eyes and nods his head – “‘OK!’”Cross credits much of his success to good music teachers at school and free workshops around London supported by now-dwindling arts funding. As a teenager, he played with Kinetika Bloco, a youth performance group that runs a summer school at the Southbank Centre. “We’d be playing the Notting Hill carnival or Thames festival and marching for hours,” he says. This prepared him for Sons of Kemet’s frenetic live shows where he plays “intensely with two drummers for an hour and a half. That requires real stamina.”Much of the year ahead will be given over to Sons of Kemet – he’s just got back from playing with them in São Paulo – but he also needs to clear some space for his own music: he’s releasing a new single in October, with an album to follow around the end of the year.Clearly, committing to an unusual instrument has not served him badly in the London jazz world. “I’ve been lucky with the tuba,” says Cross. “I’ve always gravitated towards it since I was young. It wasn’t really a choice: I’d say the tuba picked me.” KFLondon-based saxophonist and composer, 26As one of the few female brass players at the forefront of contemporary jazz, Nubya Garcia is familiar with challenging expectations. “People do look at you, and it used to bother me a lot, but I’m trying to learn how to deal with it,” she says. “If you get comments like ‘Whoa, it’s so nice to see a woman on stage’ every time you gig, which I do, eventually you’re like, ‘Godammit!’ It’s not a negative thing, it’s just that person one doesn’t know that person 30 is also saying that. It’s just normal to me, but not normal to everyone else.”Garcia, 26, from Camden, north London, graduated from Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance two years ago and since then her career as a saxophonist and composer has taken off. She got back a few days ago from playing taste-making Texas festival South by Southwest, where she was a little unprepared for the demand. “This huge queue of people followed me outside to buy my vinyl,” she says. “I was like, ‘fuck, I’ve only got 11’.” That record was last month’s When We Are, a solo EP laced with jazz, gospel, neo-soul and the electronic touches she picked up under the tutelage of the jazzdance producer Floating Points. She has also soundtracked a current touring production of A Streetcar Named Desire and she’s part of spiritual jazz-inspired ensemble Maisha. And with Nérija, the collective she is in alongside Sheila Maurice-Grey, she’s just signed her first record deal with indie label Domino."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4a07efc6214bcbd69f8d19b37316e2d2571e87/137_0_5413_3248/master/5413.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=784e45bc9fa4e87160287f679feb49af 10500w","title":"way of grief and park life fridays best photos","story":"The Guardian’s picture editors bring you a selection of photo highlights from around the world including Orthodox Christians marking Good Friday and reaction to a former South Korean president’s prison term"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d04c4cb7510a4bd9a8bec449f53425aeccee895/0_71_1731_1038/master/1731.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7b51b0673e228ade28d936bf4081213 3000w","title":"how to give your kitten the purrfect start in life","story":"Eager to bring a ball of joy and fluff into your world? Get set with everything from advice on finding your feline friend and turning your pad into a puss-worthy palace to grooming and getting them ready for the outside world. They grow up so fast …Getting you and your pad kitten-ready need not be a drama, as long as you get to grips with just what they need to feel safe and secure. Understanding how young cats work is the key to making their transition from kittenhood to a much-loved family member as smooth as possible.“Do you need eyes in the back of your head? Maybe,” laughs registered feline behaviourist, Lucy Hoile. “But knowing how a kitten matures helps us understand their behaviour, which means fewer surprises (hopefully) and you can build a solid foundation for a lifetime of wonderful feline companionship.”Finding your new kittenIf you are responding to an advert for a kitten, there are a few pointers to be aware of to ensure you are buying from a reputable breeder.“Unlike dog breeding, there isn’t the same legislation in place for cats, so it’s best to ensure you can see the mother and her litter,” explains Hoile. “Expect to be asked a lot of information about your home setup – a caring breeder will want to know where their kitten is going.”Equally, most animal shelters have lots of unwanted kittens that need rehoming, so it is often a great place to start your search. Try the RSPCA, Cats Protection League, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home or Blue Cross for more information.Prepping your padInside, tape up any gaps that could intrigue your new kitten, such as that tiny space in between your washing machine and tumble dryer. “It’s incredible the tiny gaps your kitten can squeeze through, so better safe than sorry,” says Hoile. “Kittens are programmed to explore – they’re hunters by nature, so every new thing is an adventure. In these early weeks they have less fear than when they are a little older – they really are fearless.”You may also have noticed by now that cats can climb, so don’t presume your fencing will retain them. Kittens won’t be as strong, but they can still scale a decent height. Ensure you can keep your kitten in until they have had their first set of vaccinations (about eight weeks), before letting them explore the area around their new manor.Tip: Discuss neutering with your vet as soon as you bring your cat home – a female cat can get pregnant at around six months and an unneutered Tom is not an ideal family pet.Getting the right kitWhen it comes to shopping, less is generally more, but some specific kit is essential for settling in a kitten. “You do need to buy kitten-sized kit,” advises Hoile. “It may sound obvious but a high-sided litter tray will prevent a kitten from using it, the wrong-sized litter will be sore on a kitten’s paws and a food bowl that’s too deep will deter it from feeding adequately,” advises Hoile.As a starter kit you will need:“Buying a climbingscratchinghiding kit might seem excessive, but it’s not,” says Hoile. “Kittens climb, explore and want to hone their physical ability, if they don’t have something to climb they will shoot up your curtains, along your carpet, round your sofa … they’re programmed to train their bodies, so they need an outlet to do it.”Feeding“Kittens need to be fed little and often,” says Hoile. “Ask your breeder what foods your kitten has been used to and follow suit, making sure it is age and weight appropriate. If in doubt, ask your vet.”Myth buster: kittens and cats should not be given cow’s milk. “They can’t tolerate it and it’s a myth they crave it,” says Hoile. “Kittens and cats need fresh water in the wild they would drink from fresh running water, so they prefer to drink water fresh from the tap. Wet food is good for cats as it contains water – cats need water in their diet as they often have kidney and urine issues in later life without adequate quantities.”Worming and vaccinationsA responsible breeder or animal shelter will already have wormed your cat or will raise the issue of vaccinations with you.“Once you have your kitten, book a visit to your vet as soon as possible. Many vets hold kitten days now, they will check your kitten’s health and weight and advise on the worming, flea and vaccination programme. It is also a great way for your kitten to get accustomed to a vet’s visit. The more they are exposed to as kittens, the easier they will be to handle as adults.”GroomingGrooming isn’t just for a sleek coat, it also helps us get to know our cat’s physical shape and allows us to spot any health issues as soon as possible. Short-haired cats need grooming once a week to ensure the coat is kept free of dead hair and it helps you to bond with your cat. Longer-haired cats, such as persians, need to be groomed daily.“Otherwise, the damage to their coat and their skin can be devastating,” says Hoile. “Long-haired varieties very quickly get matted and this causes problems that go beyond just a matted coat – it can lead to skin infections and more.”House-trainingIf you get your kitten at between eight and 12 weeks, they will probably have been litter trained already.“Provide a kitten-friendly tray, with kitten-sized litter and ensure it is kept clean and accessible at all times,” says Hoile. “If your kitten isn’t using it, chances are it’s not big enough, not clean enough, or the litter is either a) too highly scented or b) too big for the kitten to rake easily.”Cats are very clean animals by nature. Once your kitten is old enough to go outside, move the litter tray outside during the day and, at night, leave a clean litter tray by the door.Going outsideYour kitten should be vaccinated before it ventures outside under supervision. International Cat Care recommends your kitten is four months old and also neutered before going into the great outdoors on its own. Most vets will microchip your kitten when they are neutered, before then a kitten safety collar with a name tag is a good idea just in case they escape – and it’s not the worst idea to keep a safety collar with a home address disc on, especially in these early days. When they are ready to go outside, monitor short trips into and around the gardensurrounding spaces.Tips for a (relatively) stress-free first-timer:Of course, not all cats love the outdoors, some are happier as house cats – if you’re unsure what’s best for your cat, speak with your vet.Whether they’re in, out or – most likely – all about, an energetic new cat needs food tailored to them. Royal Canin provides nutritionally complete, age- and breed-specific diets for optimum feline health "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d43975afe3b6461e1a29cd9ba59a3831260112/2_266_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9c747103d05d3000d4eadff648e9f2a7 1240w","title":"ever evolving story humanity david reich interview neanderthals denisovans genome","story":"For David Reich, research can be a harrowing experience. The 44-year-old Harvard University geneticist says he now goes to bed terrified he will wake up to find his team’s recent, stunning discoveries about human ancestry have been proved wrong. “We are now making so many startling insights I sometimes fear it must all be incorrect,” he says.To be fair to Reich, no one has yet found any hint his results are invalid. “That still doesn’t stop me worrying,” he insists.Reich’s work as a leader of prehistoric population studies includes the discovery that all people of non-African descent carry small amounts of Neanderthal DNA, showing that Homo sapiens – at one stage – must have interbred with this long-dead species of ancient humans. Reich was also involved in uncovering the existence of Denisovans, a previously unknown species of ancient humans, using DNA found in fossil scraps in a Siberian cave.In addition, he has discovered that 5,000 years ago northern Europe was overrun by invaders from central Asia, a migration of profound importance – for those newcomers became the first people of the British Isles.These remarkable recreations of our past are outlined in Reich’s book Who We Are and How We Got Here, in which he chronicles the spectacular rise of ancient DNA studies in the last few years. Thanks to this remarkable new science, we now know that about 70,000 years ago, our planet was remarkably rich in terms of its human variety.It was populated by modern humans, Neanderthals – and the Denisovans who, Reich has recently discovered, must have existed as at least two separate varieties: Siberian Denisovans and the more recently discovered Australo-Denisovans from south-east Asia. In addition, we also know that the Hobbit folk – Homo floresiensis, a race of tiny humans whose remains were discovered in 2003 – were then thriving in Indonesia. In those not too distant days, there were many ways to be a human, it transpires.The ingrained notion – that there has only ever been one species of human being, Homo sapiens – is a latterday fiction born of our own self-important view of ourselves. Think instead of the bar scene from Star Wars with all those various people playing and drinking, says the Israeli palaeontologist Yoel Rak. That gives a far better flavour of our evolutionary past.In making constant new discoveries about humanity, Reich and his Harvard team are now plunging into uncharted academic waters. “We are going out on a limb on so many different studies,” he says. “It is very lonely and somewhat terrifying. We don’t have the comfort of standing on the shoulders of others. We are the first. That’s why I worry.”Reich’s influence in this field has been immense and the output of his department monumental. This year alone he has been involved in producing an analysis that reveals the existence of a previously unknown group of ancient Native Americans from fossil remains uncovered in Alaska a study that shows the ancient British people who built Stonehenge and other great neolithic monuments were almost completely replaced by invaders from central Asia 5,000 years ago and a paper that indicates there were at least two waves of settlers, from Taiwan and then Papua New Guinea, which were responsible – 3,000 years ago – for the settling of one of the last pockets of the planet to be reached by humans, Vanuatu.Ancient DNA studies are overturning our oversimplified vision of our past and are the outcome of a late 20th-century revolution in molecular biology that gave scientists the power to study DNA, the material from which our genes are made, with startling precision. For the first time, the exact structure and makeup of a gene could be determined and the detailed origins of many inherited illnesses and cancers outlined, setting in motion the slow, ongoing task of developing new treatments.By contrast, the study of ancient DNA, which uses the same basic technology, began late but has since flowered far more dramatically. “It is in the area of shedding light on human migrations – rather than in explaining human biology – that the genome revolution has been a runaway success,” says Reich.The field’s hesitant start is understandable. In samples from living animals, DNA exists in long, healthy, easily analysed strands. However, DNA starts to decay the moment an organism dies and those strands quickly fragment. And the longer the passage of time, the shorter the fragments become.This disintegration poses problems. If, for example, you want to study Neanderthals, who dominated Europe for around 400,000 years and who were close in evolutionary terms to Homo sapiens, DNA from their fossils is going to be in minuscule pieces. The last member of this doomed species died more than 40,000 years ago, after all. Genetic material taken from Neanderthal fossils is also likely to be contaminated with large amounts of DNA from bacteria and vegetation – and sometimes from researchers.Trying to create a genome from these sullied scraps has been likened, by writer Elizabeth Kolbert, to reassembling “a Manhattan telephone book from pages that have been put through a shredder, mixed with yesterday’s trash and left to rot in a landfill”.Nevertheless, scientists have persevered and in 2007, geneticist Svante Pääbo, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, decided to assemble a team of experts to sequence a Neanderthal genome that would be billions of DNA units in length. Reich, an innovator in the field of studying population mixtures, was asked to join and has since played a key role in the fledgling field’s remarkable development.Clean rooms were built, advanced gene sequencers purchased and DNA extracted from Neanderthal bones that had been found in Vindija cave in Croatia. A Neanderthal genome was slowly spliced together from pieces of DNA only a few dozen units in length. It was a brilliant achievement though Reich makes clear progress was halting. “The Neanderthal sequences we were working with had a mistake approximately every 200 DNA letters,” he reveals in his book.So yes, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals had a common ancestor, about 500,000 years ago, before the former evolved as a separate species – in Africa – and the latter as a different species in Europe. Then around 70,000 years ago, when modern humans emerged from Africa, we encountered the Neanderthals, most probably in the Middle East. We briefly mixed and interbred with them before we continued our slow diaspora across the planet.In doing so, those early planetary settlers carried Neanderthal DNA with them as they spread out over the world’s four quarters. Hence its presence in all those of non-African origin. By contrast, Neanderthal DNA is absent in people of African origins because they remained in our species’s homeland.Reich has since established that such interbreeding may have occurred on more than one occasion. More importantly, his studies show that “Neanderthals must have been more like us than we had imagined, perhaps capable of many behaviours that we typically associate with modern humans”. They would, most likely, have had language, culture and sophisticated behaviours. Hence the mutual attraction.That itself is intriguing. However, there is another key implication of Reich’s work. Previously, it had been commonplace to view human populations arising from ancestral groupings like the trunk of a great tree. “Present populations budded from past ones, which branched from a common root in Africa,” he states. “And it implies that if a population separates then it does not remix, as fusions of branches cannot occur.”But the initial separation of the two lines of ancient humans who gave rise to Neanderthals and to Homo sapiens – and then their subsequent intermingling – shows that remixing does occur. Indeed, Reich believes it was commonplace and that the standard tree model of populations is basically wrong. Throughout our prehistory, populations have split, reformed, moved on, remixed and interbred and then moved on again. Alliances have shifted and empires have fallen in a perpetual, sliding global Game of Thrones.An illustration is provided by the puzzling fact that Europeans and Native Americans share surprising genetic similarities. The explanation was provided by Reich who has discovered that a now nonexistent group of people, the Ancient North Eurasians, thrived around 15,000 years ago and then split into two groups. One migrated across Siberia and gave rise to the people who crossed the Bering land bridge between Asia and America and later gave rise to Native Americans. The other group headed west and contributed to Europeans. Hence the link between Europeans and Native Americans.No physical specimen of the Ancient North Eurasian people had ever been discovered when Reich announced their existence. Instead, he based his analysis on the ghostly impact of their DNA on present-day people. However, the fossil remains of a boy, recently found near the Siberian village of Mal’ta, have since been found to have DNA that matches the genomes of Ancient North Eurasians, giving firmer physical proof of their existence.“Prior to the genome revolution, I – like most others – had assumed that the big genetic clusters of populations we see today reflect deep splits of the past. But in fact the big clusters today are themselves the result of mixtures of very different populations that existed earlier. There was never a single trunk population in the human past. It has been mixtures all the way down.”Instead of a tree, a better metaphor would be a trellis, branching and remixing far back into the past, says Reich, whose work indicates that the idea of race is a very fluid, ephemeral concept. However, he is adamant that it is a very real one and takes issue with those geneticists who argue that there are no substantial differences in traits between populations.“This is a strategy that we scientists can no longer afford and that in fact is positively harmful,” he argues. Plenty of traits show differences between populations: skin colour, susceptibility to disease, the ability to breath at high altitudes and the ability to digest starch. More to the point, uncovering these differences is only just beginning. Many more will be discovered over the decades, Reich believes. Crucially, we need to be able to debate the implications of their presence at varying levels in different populations. That is not happening at present and that has dangerous implications.“If as scientists we wilfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, we will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience, an outcome that is far worse than anything we could achieve by talking openly,” says Reich.The genome revolution provides us with a shared history, he adds. “If we pay proper attention, it should give us an alternative to the evils of racism and nationalism and make us realise that we are all entitled equally to our human heritage.”• Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past by David Reich is published by Oxford University Press (£20).

Reed could become the first ever Masters winner to shoot four sub-70 rounds.McIlroy has waited seven years to be in the last Masters pairing. How he reacts will draw glances from beyond golf. It is hardly a leap of faith to point out the majority within the sport will root for the Ulsterman. McIlroy himself was brilliantly bullish on Saturday evening as he firmly laid down the gauntlet to Reed. McIlroy’s day-three 65 outscored Reed by two.“Patrick has a three-shot lead I feel like all the pressure is on him,” said McIlroy. “He has got to protect that and he has some pretty big-time players behind him. He has to sleep on that tonight. I feel like I have nothing to lose.“My game is right there. I don’t feel like there is any shot on the golf course that I can’t execute and I think I’ve shown that in the last three days. This isn’t my first time in this position. I have a lot of experience and experience that I have learnt from, good and bad.”In a further, obvious jab McIlroy added: “I know what it’s like to be in that position. It isn’t easy, especially if it’s your first time. I’m going to free‑wheel it and play like I have nothing to lose, everything to gain. Which is true.”Reed had dropped a shot at the 12th hole when seeing his lead over McIlroy reduced to two. The battle was on the Northern Irishman saved par from the middle of an azalea bed ahead at the 13th. Proof that Reed lacks nothing in competitive spirit was to follow.Reed’s 215-yard approach to within 14ft of the 13th hole might be the shot of this tournament. The Texan duly converted for an eagle. That Reed may have the golfing gods, as well as obvious talent, in his corner could be readily inferred two holes later. Reed, in a tricky lie 30 yards out from the flag on 15, chipped in for another two-stroke boost. For McIlroy hope, unlikely hope, appeared one hole later as Reed three-putted for a bogey. Better was to come for McIlroy before he strode so purposefully from the 18th green following a birdie. Reed missed an opportunity for the same.It would be folly to believe only two players can win this major. At any other venue this would be a two horse race but fortunes can switch so rapidly at Augusta National that the leaderboard as a whole must be considered. “There’s a lot more players in this tournament than Patrick Reed and I,” McIlroy warned. “Guys can get off to hot starts on a Sunday here.”A host of illustrious names lurk with intent. Rickie Fowler is the most prominent among them, his 65 meaning a 54-hole total of nine under. This was Fowler’s lowest ever major championship round and his first bogey-free round at the Masters.Jon Rahm would love nothing more than to receive a Green Jacket from his fellow Spaniard, Sergio Garcia. Rahm’s third round of 65 – matching Fowler and McIlroy as the best score of the day – moved him to minus eight. Recent history says Rahm will not buckle under pressure should he find himself in a position where winning is possible. His credentials should be taken seriously.Henrik Stenson is seven under. Bubba Watson has improved his scoring in each round of this event. A 68 moved him to six under. He has Tommy Fleetwood for company there.Not even a bogey at the last could remove the smile from Fleetwood’s face. In only his second Augusta appearance the Southport man produced a Saturday 66. Can he win? “I’ve no idea,” replied Fleetwood. Which does not mean by any stretch that he will not try.He added: “I’ve watched the Masters in the past and I know anything can happen. I suppose it depends on how many players there are that are up there in the mix but it doesn’t matter that much to me. I’m just happy that I shot that score today and put myself into some kind of spot on the leaderboard. It was just nice to do that, really. Two years ago, I was not close to being part of this.“As much as it suits my eye, and hopefully I’ll have many more times where I’ll play the tournament, there’s so much to learn on the golf course. And I’m kind of really enjoying doing it. You know, we turn up at so many tournaments and we have two days to prepare and you can generally get a really good feel for it.“At Augusta, you never feel like you’ve done enough. You never feel like you can actually do enough. I’ve enjoyed that side of it.”A 72 from Tiger Woods retained his plus four total. Woods again bemoaned poor iron play, with the returning 14-times major champion setting a Sunday target of returning to even par by the end of round four. Such an ambition, of course, is a far cry from the aspirations of the masses as Woods entered this tournament. He will, at least, move back inside the top 100 of the world rankings from next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d027a812679c97624d2fe410770c0aba7b09c315/0_19_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=fb73a6a914baa97b1531607a8488f434 1240w","title":"fernando alonso no regrets id make the same decisions 100 times","story":"He is happy now McLaren are allied to Renault but the 2005 and 2006 F1 champion has had a difficult decade. Still, he believes he has always made the right call given the situationFernando Alonso has so often presented a stern grimace for the past three years that it is hugely pleasing to meet him relaxed and buoyant and now sporting a broad grin. He is one of the greatest talents of this generation but the latter part of his career has been almost as torturous to watch as it must have been for him to endure. This season, sitting in the paddock, the Spaniard exudes optimism as well as the familiar determination that has brought him two world championships and kept him fighting through a rollercoaster career in Formula One. Times may have been hard but the passion that drives Alonso has never left him.After wrestling with a woefully underpowered McLaren-Honda for those three years the negativity became so all-encompassing that he tired even of talking about it. Now McLaren are allied with Renault and looking to return to the front of the grid Alonso is happier to open up on what kept him going.“I am a very competitive person in everything,” he says. “Not only F1 but in everyday life. That has helped me to continue for so long. Every day, every year, every new season is a reset from the last and you are still hungry for success, to do things better and better.“I always had that, even when I was a kid in a go-kart or when I was playing soccer or tennis, that need of winning. It was there all my life and it’s still there now.”It drove him to those two titles for Renault, in 2005 and 2006, when he became the then youngest double world champion, aged 25, both times beating Michael Schumacher, who already had his seven championships. Such was Alonso’s talent that more seemed inevitable. However, now 36, he has yet to repeat the feat, while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel have gone on to take four apiece.The Spaniard’s career since leaving Renault has been one of huge expectation that has remained unfulfilled. A torrid year alongside Hamilton at McLaren followed before he returned to Renault for three years, during which time he might have joined Brawn or Red Bull – both of whom proved to have title-winning cars – but he opted to join Ferrari in 2010. By the end of 2014 his relationship with the Scuderia had broken down and he returned to the bright hope, and then disappointment, of McLaren’s renewed partnership with Honda.His relationships with teams have been known to be difficult, doubtless fuelled by the frustration he has felt at not quite being in the right place at the right time. But now in his 17th season in F1, there is no interest in dwelling on the past.“I don’t regret any decisions,” he says. “Obviously if you can see the future with a crystal ball, you would make different decisions because the performance in the following years were very different. But I don’t regret it because at the moment I took those decisions, I would make the same decision 100 times again. For me at that point it was black and\u0026nbspwhite.“I don’t look back but I understand the questions. The fans would like to see me winning.”He is understandably popular. Winning or not, Alonso is compelling, with an ability to extract more from a car than almost any other driver. His defence against Schumacher at Imola in 2005 was a masterclass. A year later he qualified his Renault in fifth place at Monza while missing part of the rear bodywork, a performance that the team’s data suggested should have been impossible.In 2010, despite his Ferrari not being as quick as the Red Bull, it was only a strategic error by his team that cost him the title at the last round. In 2012 he fought back again. Ferrari opened with the fifth fastest car but Alonso’s skill manhandled it to a lead in the championship and then to a deciding final race only to be denied once again by Vettel.He acknowledges the German and Hamilton as great talents but insists it is still Schumacher that commands his greatest respect. “Michael was a competitor, a driver that never gave up, he never stopped believing in the win,” he says. “It was difficult to open a gap in terms of points because he was always there delivering something special. Michael didn’t need the perfect car – he was always delivering the result.”He admits to becoming frustrated (which is often made public in exasperated radio messages) but insists that he has taken positives from every experience, particularly with British teams. “Maybe the British culture is that way,” he says. “For us more Latin characters maybe we get very high and they will always calm things. When things are bad they are very united, they are very proactive to change things. This has influenced me a lot in my career.”Alonso’s fifth place in Melbourne flattered McLaren’s real position in this season’s pecking order and he has warned that a successful upgrade of the car over the next two months is crucial to the season ahead. To qualify 13th for Sunday’s race in Bahrain proves there is work still to be done and he will be busy. He will also compete at Le Mans as part of a full season of the World Endurance Championship with Toyota. With two victories in the Monaco Grand Prix, winning the 24-hour race would leave Alonso missing only the Indianapolis 500 in his pursuit of motor racing’s triple crown.But at McLaren the mood is already palpably more upbeat and they need to deliver to keep him on board. He is the team’s greatest asset and still capable of making a difference beyond the machinery he is given. Last season the recurring question was whether he would call it a day in F1 for now, happy behind the wheel, his passion for the sport is as strong as ever and once again the only season that matters is this one.“In 2007-08 I thought: ‘Maybe I will race a couple more years,’ but then situations change, your career changes,” he says. “It is difficult to take in how long you have been doing one thing when you compete at the highest level and always with the highest intensity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1d74290c2ed02f9b5a9368bcebfcd3f8010db2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=02a7fdefe6fe511f5f7277f00ff86d9f 1240w","title":"james degale wins back ibf super middleweight title from caleb truax","story":"James DeGale regained the IBF super middleweight title he lost in December to Caleb Truax with a bloody, 12-round unanimous decision on Saturday at the Hard Rock Hotel \u0026amp Casino in Las Vegas.The fight was an immediate rematch of what many thought was the upset of the year in boxing in 2017. The 32-year-old DeGale (24-2-1 14 KOs) held the IBF world title at 168lbs for 31 months before losing it to the 34-year-old Truax (29-4-2, 18 KOs) on DeGale’s home turf in London.“I’m back,” DeGale said. “Two-and-a-half years I had it and I lost it to Caleb. He embarrassed me, but we’re back.”DeGale suffered a massive cut just over his right eye on an accidental head butt that led to extensive bleeding in the third round.“I couldn’t see from my right eye,” DeGale said. “I couldn’t see. But I’m just glad I got through it. I showed some heart. In my last fight, I was like a weak little kid.”“I want to be busy,” DeGale said. “I have a couple years left in this sport.”Truax was just the fourth boxing world champion ever from Minnesota.“I thought I did enough to win the fight, but I also thought I was pretty flat and didn’t get my shots off like I wanted,” Truax said.The rematch was the co-main event to the junior middleweight title unification fight between Jarrett Hurd and Erislandy Lara, where Hurd used a 12th-round knockdown to secure a split-decision victory to unify the IBF and WBA junior middleweight world titles.Two judges scored the fight 114-113 for Hurd, while the third judge had Lara winning the fight by the same 114-113 scorecard.Hurd connected on a short left hook with less than a minute remaining, knocking down for former WBA champion Lara (25-3-2, 14 KOs), the longest reigning champion at 154lbs entering the fight. Lara was attempting to defend his title for the sixth consecutive time.“I didn’t feel like I needed the knockdown for the win,” said the 27-year-old Hurd, from Accokeek, Maryland. “I felt like I was in control the whole fight, applying the pressure.”The win for Hurd (21-0, 15 KOs) sets up a potential mega-matchup against Jermell Charlo, who has held the WBC light middleweight world title since 2016.Hurd is the seventh unified world title holder in 154lb history, joining Hall of Famers Terry Norris, Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya and Winky Wright, as well as Floyd Mayweather and Canelo Alvarez.The 34-year-old Lara from Houston thought he won the fight, despite the knockdown in the final round.“I was up by a large margin going into the last round,” said Lara, who suffered swelling and a cut around his right eye. “The problem was the cut on the eye. I couldn’t see in the last round.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4e5356ef5ff41fa635998c517fc7a484bcaf46f/0_219_2578_1547/master/2578.jpg?w=2500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a325ce6856494bcd9da95e0fbb6c3030 5000w","title":"commonwealth games day three in pictures","story":"All the latest pictures from the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as gymnasts, swimmers, cyclists and weightlifters battle for medals"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f772248fa1d83d95cc1152c4b4c6370c390948fb/0_102_3570_2142/master/3570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d372db4f8e37a4850397047cc5575c2f 1240w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day four athletics basketball hockey and more live","story":"The women’s 10km scratch race is close to ready.

He and Inglis are the fastest losers.In they go, and Peaty has a terrible lion tatt, but is leading nonetheless! Now, here comes Adam Peaty! It’s time for the semis of the men’s 50m breaststroke. Van den Bergh of RSA wins the first heat with McKenchie of Australia second, Inglis of Scotland third and Benson of Scotland fourth. Quote of the Games so far comes from Cate Campbell: “I had goosebumps when the crowd started shouting Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oi, Oi, Oi.”We’re just watching Duncan Scott’s medal ceremony. Obviously Chad Le Clos’s da is there, enjoying his life. We’ve got some women’s keirin heats on the track at the moment, but in eight minutes it’s the finals of the women’s 10km scratch race. That was incredible. He had to wait till last, he had to dismount, and then he absolutely punished the field anyway.Dawkins of NZ is takes silver and Chambers of Scotland bronze. The winning time, 59.340, is the fastest ever set at sea level. And the crowd are going wild! They’re roaring Glaetzer home! He’s inside it by miles, 0.81 with 500m to go!And he’s still ahead at halfway! Glaetzer is leading by three tenths!He’s ready to go, but there’s a clock issue, so down he comes. Juat what you need. Matt Glaetzer of Australia, the world sprint champion and only man to go faster this season than Dawkins has, is on the line...And he’s there in 1:01.083! That’s enough for second, and he’s guaranteed himself a medal! Calum Skinner is out and +0.394 at the bell....Zac Williams of NZ is out on the track, and he doesn’t threaten his team-mate but does register the second-fastest time of the contest. Only Skinner and Glaetzer still to come...Email from Dylan Wilson: “Any chance of an honourable mention for Steven Kari, the weightlifter from Papua New Guinea who broke the Commonwealth Games clean and jerk record in the men’s 94kg category to snatch (pun intended) victory? I was there with my kids and it was a thrilling performance (having never seen live weightlifting before). The Canadian Boady Santavay had already broken the snatch record and Kari had to go big to win gold. There were tears on the podium, PNG’s first gold of the championship. No one else has picked up on it.”Laura Daniels of Wales takes silver, after leading more or less all the way through the match. But he can’t hang on! He’s fifth, and Dawkins is nearly there! Joe Truman is half a second inside Dawkins at halfway!Back at yon velodrome, Mohd Zonis starts well in his chase, but ties up badly in the fourth 500m and winds up seventh.

They’ve just played the 22nd end. Soniia Cheah has beaten Chloe Birch 2-1 in their badminton singles match - Malaysia now lead England 2-0 in their mixed team semi. But in the meantime, the bowling is now 17 apiece. In just seven minutes’ time, we’re into the pool for the women’s 200m backstroke final. In the bowls, Daniels’ lead is now down to a point after 20 ends. Can she hang on for Wales? He’s plenty off. He finishes in second, 0.4s ahead of Paul. Patrick Constable of Australia is on the track, the first serious challenger to Dawkins ... but he’s outside the time at halfway, and drifting further off!In the bowls, Edwards has closed on Daniels – Wales now lead NZ 15-13 at the end of the 17th end. In the men’s kilo, Dawkins is still leading, but there’s plenty still in the hutch. Look at Tin-Tin Ho! She flies through the deciding set, and when Miao Miao nets a backhand, that’s enough for 11-6!The greatest cuisine in the world apart from maybe Ghana. Fight me.

Her family, farmers in a rural county of China’s south-western Sichuan province, never treated her differently. When Kang asked about her birth parents, she was told she had been found on the street, a little girl no more than four years old, probably abandoned.In March, Kang, now 28, learned that was not the whole story. Married and with children of her own, she began to wonder about her own mother. She searched online for “child lost more than 20 years ago” and came across a sketch that made her stop. The drawing had been posted by a couple in Chengdu, about 100 miles from where she grew up, who had been searching for their daughter for the last 24 years. The father, a taxi driver, had been handing out cards about his missing daughter to all of his passengers. The online ad was their latest effort.She called the contact listed and, less than a month later, flew to Chengdu to meet her birth parents. The family met for the first time on Tuesday in an emotional reunion that captured the public imagination, a rare happy ending for one of the thousands of Chinese families who have lost a child.On Friday, Kang was visiting her parents again to celebrate their reunion in her father’s village, two hours from Chengdu where they normally live. Her mother washed dishes and prepared food in a dark kitchen at the back of the family home. Kang took her children to play outside. “I thought it would be awkward meeting them after so much time, but it felt natural. I guess it’s because we are family,” Kang said.In China, anywhere between 50,000 and 200,000 children go missing every year, according to estimates. In most cases the children have been abandoned, the result of multiple factors: rural poverty, China’s formerly stringent one-child policy, a preference for sons and larger families, and local traditions.But many have also been kidnapped, to be sold within the country as couples struggle with rising infertility rates and imbalances caused by population controls. Boys fetch higher prices, but according to Anqi Shen, a professor at Northumbria Law School in Newcastle who researched trafficking, girls are also in demand because of the belief they will take care of ageing parents.“What we can say is that child trafficking and abduction was a historical social problem in China, and it remains a serious problem,” she said.Kang’s parents, Wang Mingqing and Liu Dengying, were selling bananas at a market in Chengdu in 1994 when Kang, whom they had named Qifeng and called Fengwazi, or “Feng baby”, went missing. Liu sent her husband to get change for a customer. When he returned, Kang had disappeared. They ran through the market shouting her name but she was gone. She was three years old. Liu sank into a depression, refusing to work, sleep or eat. Her husband cycled the streets of Chengdu calling his daughter’s name. Eventually they went back to work. They had two other children.But they never quite let it go. Wang subscribed to a newspaper hoping for news of Kang. In 2015, he began driving for the taxi-hailing app Didi and had hundreds of cards printed with information about their missing daughter. They did not have a photograph of Kang so they used a picture of her sister. Every time the phone rang, Liu would jump, thinking it might be Kang. Eventually, news of Wang’s efforts went viral and a police sketch artist volunteered to do the drawing that caught Kang’s attention. When Kang called them in March, the three of them spoke over video on WeChat. Wang and Liu had spoken to 30 other women they thought might be Kang but this time felt different.“When we saw her I had this feeling of being a mother that I never felt with any of the others. I knew for sure she was my daughter,” Liu said.They started to talk over the phone every day, and decided Kang should do a DNA test. When she became anxious about how long it would take, Wang told his daughter: “We’ve been waiting for this for years. It’s OK if we wait a few days more.”China has criminalised the buying of children, punishable with three years in prison, and established a national DNA database for searching families. Still, the problem persists. On the website, Baobeihuijia, or Baby Come Home, more than 41,000 sets of parents are looking for lost children. On 1 April, Kang got a call from the police telling her she should book a flight to Chengdu. Her DNA matched. Two days later, Kang made the journey with her husband and two children. They were swarmed by a horde of reporters and television crews.“I’d never seen so many people. My mind went empty,” she said. In the crowd she saw her mother holding a sign: “Child, welcome home.” Kang went back to her parent’s home in Chengdu, where they stayed up until the early hours of the morning. “I don’t remember what we talked about. We just didn’t stop talking,” she said.The next day, Kang’s father wanted to take her to his village, two hours from Chengdu, where his family has lived for generations. Relatives and friends came, filling 20 dining tables set out in the yard. Kang’s father parked at the village gate and insisted on carrying her on his back the rest of the way. He told her how much his parents, now dead, had prayed that she would be found. “Now I can finally tell my mom I’ve brought our Fengwazi back,” he said.Kang, who lives in China’s northern Jilin province, more than 1,500 miles from Chengdu, still talks with her birth parents most days. They understand that she has a separate life and her own family. On Thursday on Tomb Sweeping Day, a holiday for families to honour their ancestors, Wang drove them three hours to where Kang’s adoptive father and grandparents are buried. Kang watched as her parents knelt and kowtowed at their graves. They thanked them for raising their daughter and said they were sorry they had not.“At that moment, I really felt like crying. I don’t want my parents to feel regretful. It’s not their fault,” Kang said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68a8e5e257bf425d8fc566f4871f0b477b805b04/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bfa451b79b2562ba502dd26e0195c15c 1240w","title":"the spirit of 1968 rises again can french students and workers triumph","story":"President Macron faces his biggest challenge as strikes and protests recall the epic struggle that rocked France to its core. We can win, insist this generation…At Nanterre university, on the outskirts of Paris, militant students have a dilemma: how can they pass their end-of-year exams while simultaneously fighting to derail the French government’s education reforms?“It’s a worry, but we’ll find a way,” says Annaël Lombe, a student union leader who is taking his political science finals in a few weeks. “Exams or not, we won’t stop the protest. We will carry on the action.”Fifty years ago, Nanterre students issued much the same warning. It turned out to be far from an idle threat. Subsequent protests at Nanterre sparked the May 1968 civil unrest that drew 10 million students and striking workers on to the streets and brought France to a halt. It was a dramatic – some thought revolutionary –moment in French history that nearly toppled a government.In the end, the protests fizzled out, but even now the events remain a model of how people power can rattle French political leaders and in doing so change society.Today, as France again faces revolts from students and workers, the left sees a rare opportunity to reignite the spark that set the country alight in 1968: railway workers opposed to legislation to change their status have taken to the streets en masse and halted much of the train network Air France pilots are striking over pay the elderly are furious about pension reforms students are protesting over proposed changes to access to higher education.President Emmanuel Macron plans to change the baccalaureate requiring students to specialise earlier and to introduce more selective entry requirements for universities as opposed to the current lottery system. Opponents say the measures go against France’s tradition of free education for all and will penalise poorer students.For Macron, this is the biggest challenge to his leadership since his election a year ago. For others, such as the hard-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, this chaos has the makings of a long-awaited convergence des luttes: a coming together of various worker and popular struggles into one general movement. May 1968 revisited, in other words.“The president of the rich has decided to confront us,” Mélenchon said last week. “We will fight back. We will see who will have the final word. If we have the wisdom to unite across the country … the final word will be ours. To those who suggest with a wry smile that I dream of May ’68, I say, yes it’s a fine dream. I prefer my lovely dream to the nightmares that are in the process of happening.”Protest – often violent and disruptive – is part of France’s political culture. As the historian, writer and commentator Jacques Julliard pointed out: “To go from Louis XVI to Louis XVIII, that is to say from moderate absolutism to parliamentary monarchy, those maladroit foreigners would have gone by way of a Louis XVII. Instead, we went via Robespierre and Napoleon.”May 1968 still ides France, half a century on: a triumph of idealism and emancipation for the left a tragedy marking the beginning of the end of the Gaullist era and the disintegration of French society for those on the right.Les évènements were unexpected but did not come out of the blue. Charles de Gaulle, 77, had been in power for almost a decade, and while France was economically prosperous, it was run by a rigidly conservative administration. Women were not allowed to open bank accounts without their husband’s permission homosexuality and abortion were crimes there was a record number of university students, who were strictly segregated into separate dormitories.The Nanterre students took their protests to the heart of Paris: the Left Bank and the Sorbonne, ripping up paving stones to lob at CRS riot police, whom they taunted with CRS SS placards. Paris’s most celebrated quarter became both a battleground and a debating club. The students joined forces with eight million angry workers – who worried De Gaulle’s government more – but union leaders were as traditional and paternalistic as the president, and spooked by his suggestion that the youthful revolution was heading towards a Communist takeover.The government wobbled, saving itself by making major concessions to the striking workers. Despite the rallying call of Jean-Paul Sartre, committed to the strikers’ cause, workers went back to work and the students returned to their studies. “The Communists are afraid of the revolution,” Sartre wrote afterwards.Thomas Guénolé, of Mélenchon’s La France Insoumise party, says May 1968 was not just about 60s sexual emancipation or a “spiritual revolution” but was also part of a “global revolt against capitalism” which carries on today. “From beginning to end, May ’68 was a social movement, with the aim of overthrowing the system. It didn’t succeed, but it would confirm the fundamental lesson of the massive strikes of 1919-1920 and 1936, and that is: when a large strike paralyses the economy of a country, the government and employers give in after a few weeks at the most. Fifty years on, this lesson is still valid,” Guenolé said recently.Others see little chance of today’s protesters, with their erse demands, forming a strong enough alliance to force the reformist Macron and his government, elected only a year ago, to capitulate.Laurent Bouvet, a political scientist, believes today’s protests are the French left’s attempt to rerun last year’s presidential and legislative elections, in which they were defeated (and in the case of the Socialist party trounced).“This is Mélenchon, the unions, the far left and even the Parti Socialiste trying to get their revenge for Macron’s election. It’s a return match,” Bouvet told the Observer. “But having voted Macron in only a year ago, I cannot see the French in massive numbers turning against him – even those who didn’t vote for him and don’t agree with his reforms.”He added: “People have forgotten the reality of May ’68. They forget the general strike that paralysed transport and remember it as a student revolt. What happened, and this is particularly French, is the people who organised this revolt quickly became people who had responsible jobs in the media, and when the left finally arrived in power in 1980 they began celebrating ’68 because it was such an important date in their youth.“And so a mythology emerged about the events on both sides, left and right, that was completely false.” It was really the last big movement in which the left played a big part, and everyone on the left wants to keep that illusion.”As the current wave of rolling strikes by rail workers, and sit-ins and blockades by students continues, opinion polls show France is ided over support for Macron’s economic reforms, a pillar of his presidential manifesto. La France Insoumise has been leafleting students across the country, and Mélenchon has called for two anti-Macron demonstrations in Marseille, his parliamentary constituency.Outside the Sorbonne in the Latin Quarter of Paris, there is no blockade, and many students seemed indifferent to the protests. “I’m not happy with the reforms, and I think Macron is being authoritarian,” said Anya, a humanities student reading in the sunshine. “We have to protest for what we believe that’s what young people do. But this isn’t May ’68. The social context is completely different.”Nor was there any sign of students revolting at Nanterre on Friday. But Lombe, 24, the treasurer of France’s main student union UNEF, which has 30,000 members, including 800 at Nanterre, says the protest movement is growing, directed at a society in which “precariousness has replaced prosperity”.“1968 was our grandparents’ battle. In every era the young have decided to mobilise because they have had something to say and they don’t agree with society. It’s what we do: we challenge, fight, make demands. Although our demands are different, the young today, like those in 1968, want to be autonomous, emancipated, recognised as equals to the rest of society. We want people to listen to us,” Lombe said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1892a236b5d8b2d9a65835a0c6ae464bfd1c9949/14_0_1873_1124/master/1873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4515a00b91f2bf05a6864e0453ad2afc 1240w","title":"rudolf slansky czechoslovakia show trial","story":"It was among the most notorious show trials of the 20th century, the prosecution and sentencing to death of Czechoslovakia’s leading communist, who had been arrested in a brutal purge ordered by Stalin.But an event that has fascinated historians could soon be seen in graphic detail after footage and audio recording of the 1952 trial was found. Hours of film and voice recordings, much of it mould-damaged, believed to cover most of the eight-day procedure were found stashed in metal and wooden boxes – along with millions of classified Czechoslovak Communist party documents – in the basement of a bankrupt former metal research business in Panenské Břežany, near Prague.The discovery came after Czech historians and archivists lost trace of recordings known to have been made on the orders of the communist authorities in preparation for a propaganda film that was never produced.The material was found by an insolvency specialist, who alerted historians after seeing labels on the boxes that clearly advertised their content.By strange coincidence, the bankrupt plant occupied the same grounds as a castle which, during the occupation of Czechoslovakia, was used as a residence by the Nazi governor of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of the Holocaust, until his assassination in 1942.The items are believed to have been removed from the Communist party’s headquarters and hidden after the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule in what was then Czechoslovakia.Historians are unsure whether they were spirited away to ensure their safekeeping with a view to selling them for profit or to conceal evidence about the trial, which is widely considered one of the darkest stains on the party’s record.The material – consisting of six hours of 35mm black-and-white film and 80 hours of audio – is now with the Czech National Film Archive, which is asking the government for an estimated 12m koruna (£410,000) to fund delicate restoration work that would make it fit for public viewing.Michal Bragant, the archive’s chief executive, called the discovery “a great opportunity” because it would allow Czech archivists to compile a rare video depiction of Stalin-era show trials, very few of which have available long-form footage.“The priority is to make the footage safe,” Bragant said. “But it will be even safer once it’s publicly available, because we also need to make the knowledge safe. We still have not learned enough from the 20th century. The more people learn about it and the horror of the show trials, the safer we will be.“One day, when we can make it available for the public, you will be able to see the facial expressions, people’s movements, the body language and the staged performances. Because this was nothing to do with due process. It was all rehearsed.”Slánský, who spent much of the second world war exiled in Moscow, was put on trial along with 13 other high-ranking communists in November 1952, accused of “Titoism” and Zionism. The charges were fuelled by Stalin’s wish to purge eastern European communist parties after the Soviet Union’s break with the Yugoslav regime of Josip Broz Tito and his anger that Israel, born four years earlier, had not become a communist state.The trial had antisemitic overtones, with Slánský and 10 of the other defendants being Jewish. Slánský is believed to have been tortured into a convoluted, rehearsed confession, which he made in court before requesting to be punished with the death penalty.He was hanged in Prague’s Pankrac prison on 3 December 1952, but was exonerated during the liberalising Prague spring of 1968. Plans to turn the trial footage into a propaganda film were shelved after Stalin died in March 1953."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeab28d6b37cfa2416e261a26aeda8f497f6b2da/0_158_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ad5e7f10de08264346470011e515c9ca 1240w","title":"these are people with nothing to lose inside defiant gaza","story":"Hashem Zakout should have been at his local hospital yesterday doing the voluntary work as a clerk that he hopes will lead to a paid full-time job. Instead the 24-year-old was a patient in the emergency room at another northern Gaza hospital, shot in the left knee after throwing “little stones” at Israeli troops across the border, east of the Jabaliya refugee camp where he lives.Zakout was wounded on Friday when he was 10 metres from the border fence, hit by a sniper during the latest mass protests at the ide between Israel and Gaza. The “Great March of Return”, a series of protests intended to continue until 15 May, the 70th annual commemoration of “the Nakba” or catastrophe, when 700,000 Palestinian refugees were forced from their homes in the 1948 war, has captured his imagination.Insisting he was “not afraid”, Zakout said he had been taking part in the protests for the idea of a “return to our lands” – the home in what is now Israel, from which his grandparents had to flee in 1948. But he also said he would not have joined Friday’s border demonstration if he had a full-time job.As it is, he relies – humiliatingly – on “pocket money” from his father, a former policeman for the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority, which has itself been cut by half as part of President Mahmoud Abbas’s sanctions on Gaza, which are designed to squeeze the Hamas leaders who run it. Zakout would like to get married but couldn’t afford it. “I have energy,” said Zakout. “But I need someone to employ me.”As an unemployed man Zakout is typical of many of the 491 Palestinians injured during the latest protests. He was lucky not to be one of the nine killed, among them a 14-year-old boy and a politically unaffiliated Palestinian video journalist, Yaser Murtaja, shot dead despite wearing a jacket showing he was press.The injured were being treated for gunshot wounds, or after being hit by teargas canisters and inhaling the gas, on the second Friday of what may yet prove a historic phenomenon: the first mass unarmed demonstrations in Gaza since the first intifada more than 30 years ago. That was the uprising that led in time to the 1993 Oslo accord between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat and the huge hopes they engendered of ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The spectacle presented on Friday in warm sunshine at the border areas, where some 20,000 Palestinians had gathered, was a confusion of near-fiesta and battlefield. Music mixed with the cries of foodsellers – some wearing gasmasks – advertising everything from lupine seeds and smoothies to calf liver sandwiches.The festive sounds mingled with the crack of teargas canisters and the whistle of bullets, fired by troops on youths throwing stones and petrol bombs. White coils of teargas streaked across huge clouds of thick black smoke, billowing towards the sky as young Palestinians sought to obscure the Israeli troops’ sightlines by burning dozens of tyres. Sirens sounded as ambulances stationed 150 metres or so from the border, red lights flashing, relayed the injured to hospitals and field clinics outside the danger zone.The previous evening it had looked as though families would stay away, deterred by the 17 Palestinian deaths in the 30 March protest, the highest number on a single day since the 2014 war. Few if any buses ferried the demonstrators to the border, as they had the previous week when the protest co-incided with “Land Day”, marking the deaths of six Israeli Arabs protesting against the government’s seizure of agricultural land in 1976.At the Zeitoun border, south-east of Gaza City, close to the long-closed main Karni cargo crossing, teargas canisters occasionally landed further than 300 metres from the fence. By late afternoon in the north of the strip in the Abu Safiya district of Jabalya, 700 metres from the border, picnicking families, including grandparents and small children, had joined the march on foot or in cars, watching events unfold below in safety from the top of a gentle slope.Initially the Israeli military’s use of live fire was reduced compared with the previous week, but more bullets began to fly as numbers close to the border swelled. The respected Israeli human rights agency B’Tselem has urged soldiers to disobey orders to shoot at unarmed civilians. Three leading jurisprudence academics have said that firing on unarmed protesters is illegal in international law.The sustained numbers suggest that the protest organisers may be able to maintain some momentum in the weeks leading up to 15 May. The next day President Donald Trump is scheduled to defy angry Palestinian protests and a half-century-old international consensus by transferring the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.According to one Hamas source, an attempt to encourage a break across the border on Nakba day is being discussed, but no decision has been taken. If this is not sabre-rattling, much could depend on how Israel responds, and not least whether it is ready to ease the decade-long blockade of Gaza.Israel has repeatedly stated that what it describes as the “riots” are being controlled by Hamas. The protests certainly have Hamas’s active endorsement, indicated by the payment of injury compensation on a sliding scale up to $3,000 for the families of those killed in the protests. Hamas has also provided crucial logistical support, from the renting of farmland for the mini-tent cities, including children’s play areas and lavatories, at each demonstration point, to the policemen supervising parking at the sites.The “Great March of Return” has given Hamas, increasingly friendless in the region, an initiative it badly needs. But there are several reasons why this is not the whole story.Even if it did not take off until backed by Hamas, the original idea for an unarmed protest – with a conscious nod to Gandhi and Martin Luther King – appears to have originated with a group of young Palestinian intellectuals and graduate students. It was then endorsed by all the factions, including Hamas but also its arch-rivals, Fatah.One of the protest’s most ardent supporters is Atef Abu Saif, whose family were forced to leave for Gaza in 1948, and who is Gaza’s best-known living novelist.“We know we cannot defeat you. You are one of the strongest countries in the world ... but we know our will is strong. If Israel wants to belong in this territory, it has to make peace with the Palestinians.”But the wider demonstrations also attracted members of the more prosperous middle class. IT consultant Jalal Marzouk, 40, said that, as the father of four “beautiful children”, and with a wife who was furious he was attending at all, he would not be getting “too close” to the border. He said that many of his younger compatriots “don’t have any future and they are totally desperate. I have something to lose, but they have nothing to lose.”“Israel has reduced the conflict to its fundamentals,” said Raji Sourani, head of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, and the doyen of Gazan civil society. “We are back to square one.” He said Gaza has always “set the tone” for the Palestinian struggle for rights, and claims Israel’s concerted attempts to “neutralise” Gaza are destined to fail.Sourani fears Israel could draw Hamas into another war, rather than face a continued stand-off. But he believes a long-contemplated return to unarmed action looks like “the right kind of chess move” after a decade in which Palestinians have been on the defensive and preoccupied by the Fatah-Hamas split.According to Abu Saif the outcome of the coming weeks will depend on the political response not only of Israel but of an international community that he castigates for its failure to “say no” to Israel. “Unless there is a political end to it, this will be turned into disaster. Hopeless people have nothing left to lose … Nobody knows the end.”Hamas seizes full control of Gaza. Israel intensifies land, sea and air blockade and places limits on Palestinians it allows to leave through Israel.Gaza invasion launched. Israel said it is response to rockets fired into Israel. More than 1,400 Palestinians die.

It sounds like a win-win situation, but is a Lifetime Isa right for you?If someone offered you thousands of pounds towards the purchase of your first home, you might think the prospect was too good to be true. But that’s what’s on offer if you save using a Lifetime Isa. The latest addition to the range of inidual savings accounts, Lifetime Isas give savers the chance to earn extra funds to put towards their first property or later life.“Having the government bonus is a great way to boost your savings – for every £4 you save you are getting another £1,” says Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director at financial services provider OneFamily. “Even if you have got a relatively small amount to save, it does add up.”There are, of course, a couple of catches – the money can only be used to buy a property if it is genuinely your first, and the accounts can only be opened by people aged 18 to 39. However, the bonus keeps being paid, every month you pay in, until you turn 50. That means if you start as soon as you turn 18 and put in the maximum every year, you can get up to £32,000 from the government.“It isn’t for short-term savings – when people open one, either they are going to use it for a house deposit or it is going to be tucked away for their retirement,” says Audhlam-Gardiner.If you’re a steady Eddie and don’t fancy taking too much risk, a cash Lifetime Isa, similar to a normal savings account, may be most appealing. Anyone prepared to take a bit more risk can opt for a stocks and shares Lifetime Isa. If the stock market goes up, this could provide better returns than a simple cash Lifetime Isa, but you can lose money too. Stocks and shares Lifetime Isas are better suited to longer-term investments, of at least 5 years, so that any dips in the market are balanced out.Whichever you choose, you will have to plan a little in advance – you’ll need to have an account for a year before you can use it to buy a home.Got all that?

The biggest higher-education development in the State’s history will transform Dublin’s north-inner city. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDIT  Grangegorman: Over the coming years, some 20,000 students will be based at the  sprawling new campus.   Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Irish TimesFor two centuries or so, Grangegorman was a place to avoid. Few ventured behind the high walls of the old asylum on Dublin’s northside which, at its peak, housed up to 2,000 patients. This largely hidden side of Ireland seemed to function as a closed, confined space, cut off from the rest of society.Today, this vast walled-in and unknown part of the city is being opened up. A new urban quarter is slowly taking shape – as host to the biggest higher-education project in the history of the State. Over the coming years, some 20,000 students will be based at Dublin Institute of Technology’s sprawling new campus.Pedestrian walkways and the cross-city Luas are already reconnecting the 73-acre site back to the wider city. Playing fields, a playground, a primary-care centre and new primary school on campus are being used by the surrounding community.Soon, construction will begin on the first of several large-scale jigsaw pieces: faculty buildings for DIT, a theatre, gyms and apartments.The multiplier effect of all this social and economic development will be considerable. Its potential impact, say some, could rival the kind of large-scale urban renewal last seen in Georgian-era Dublin.In common with the Wide Street Commission of the time, the new project is being delivered through a combination of State funding, philanthropy and public-private partnerships.But there are real concerns. The sheer scale of the development will change the character of the area forever. Some in this long-established community say they are only now waking up to the scale of the development.Apartment blocks for about 5,000 students are planned or under way in the north inner city more than half of those within 500 metres of the campus.At a recently constructed gated student accommodation scheme – kitted out with flat-screen TVs, en suite bathrooms and access to communal cinemas and gyms – prices start at more than €1,000 a month, well out of reach for your average student.Some locals fear the area will become overwhelmed by students, who would account for 60 per cent of the population in the Grangegorman area if all proposed schemes get the go-ahead.“This is a nice, safe, lovely place to live,” says the resident of a terraced home, who declines to be named. “But an influx of students inevitably changes any residential area.“I’m fearful of what will happen: parties, anti-social behaviour, noise at night time . . . you hear similar concerns in places like Belfast and Cork. There’s no reason to believe this will be any different.”Another resident says investors are already snapping up local houses to rent and feels the voices of local people have been ignored by planning authorities.“The planning process is a waste of time. It’s a big, State-based machine we’re up against,” says one local, whose home backs onto the next phase of the development. “We’re going to be living in the middle of a construction site for the next 10 or 20 years. There are already parking problems and congestion. All of that will just get worse.”Grangegorman is what’s known as a “strategic development zone”, or SDZ, which allows for fast-track planning permission and limits the scope to appeal decisions.Some small business owners also have mixed views. While most see the benefits of a much bigger population on their doorstep, some fear being elbowed aside by developers keen to maximise their profits.Graham Kelsh runs a deli and newsagent in the Park Shopping Centre, off Prussia Street. The building’s owners want to demolish the centre, which includes a Tesco supermarket, to make way for a seven-storey development, which would include apartments for more than 500 students.“For us, nothing has changed yet. There aren’t many students there – but it’s a worry. I’m five years into a 25-year lease. There’s an older population here, there are worries about anti-social behaviour. It could also be good the area is run-down and will benefit, but there are worries.”Ger Casey, chief executive of the Grangegorman Development Agency – the State-backed agency overseeing the development – acknowledges the concerns. “They are views that are totally understandable. Without having studied this in detail, I might have held similar views myself,” he says.He says studies show on-campus, or adjacent accommodation, is good for the city in that it relieves pressure on transport. It also frees up accommodation in the area for families or workers.Apartments for about 2,000 students will be accommodated on the site itself. Demand is so high he believes other student accommodation planned by private developers on the perimeter of the site is a good thing. Well-managed and controlled student accommodation, he says, is not associated with problems around anti-social behaviour.“That’s the feedback from studies on this. We feel confident the developers we’re in touch with are involved in good-quality and well-managed developments,” he says.Whatever about the changes to come, the profile of Grangegorman and the surrounding neighbourhoods has shifted significantly.Rising numbers of young professionals have moved to places such as Stoneybatter in recent years, sparking a boom in trendy pubs and restaurants.There’s also been an influx of nationalities and ethnic groups the latest census shows about one in three residents is a non-Irish national.These changes tend to mask the fact that there are pockets of real poverty and deprivation.The proportion of unemployed people and single-parent families is, for example, about twice the national average.Patrick McCormack is principal of “The Brunner”, or St Paul’s CBS, on nearby Brunswick Street. On the wall of his office is a motto: “Strength and courage aren’t always measured in medals and victories. They are measured in the struggles they overcome.”About a third of his students progress to third level, which is about half the national average. In affluent areas, about three times as many go on to higher education.“Now that there’s a university on our doorstep, we hope it will break down those walls that are preventing students in disadvantaged areas going on to study at third level,” says McCormack. “They’ve been very responsive I get the strong impression that they’re serious about linking in with all the schools.”The school uses DIT’s all-weather soccer, tennis and basketball pitches at preferential rates it is also involved in academic link-ups.Denis Popa, a 16-year-old sixth-year student, has spent time on the campus and is thinking of applying for a course there. “It’s right beside us it would be great to go there. It feels open, it’s a nice, calm atmosphere. I’d like to do something in science,” he says.Craig Fitzharris, a Junior Cert student, says he’s been up on campus regularly for science and programming projects. “You get to know what they do and you get to know people involved. It’s also a nice place to hang out.”While many local residents have concerns over student accommodation,others see the opening up of the campus as a very positive development. They can walk their dogs, bring children to the playground.A serpentine walkway weaves its way through the campus from Stoneybatter in the west to King’s Inns in the east a route that was never possible before. Soon, work will get under way on a plaza near Broadstone, which will be the main entrance on the city side.For community workers, the fact that amenities for the local area were fast-tracked speaks volumes. “What really impressed me was that the first thing that was built, before anything else, was a playground,” says Owen Binchy of An Síol, a community development project that serves the needs of more vulnerable members of the northwest inner city.“It instantly brought young parents into the grounds of the colleges. That, for me, as a statement, was phenomenal. It leaves you optimistic that this will have a really good dynamic in the local community.”A local employment clause means that up to 20 per cent of labour will be locally sourced. “The challenge is how to develop a piece of the city that is student-oriented and welcomed by the local community, and structured so it’s part of the fabric of the city,” he says.In a sense, the development is in its infancy. Casey estimates that less than 10 per cent has been completed so far. A number of major projects are planned that will bring 10,000 students to the site by 2020, he says, but the full development may not be completed until 2030.Growing up on Dublin’s northside, Casey recalls the scary connotations around Grangegorman. Kids, he says, would taunt each other that they’d end up there. Even as student at Bolton Street years later, it was a few years before he realised what was behind the high walls.“It’s lovely to be involved in something that will change the connotation of Grangegorman from being something that many were fearful of to being a positive development.”Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish-news","story":"Anti-abortion rally told \u0026lsquovague\u0026rsquo health claims will lead to terminations beyond 12 weeksPedestrian is struck by car on M9 northboundMinister says Government wants to spend \u0026lsquomany millions more\u0026rsquo on general practiceIMO warns medical profession is \u0026lsquounder attack\u0026rsquo and doctors are \u0026lsquosick of so-called reform\u0026rsquoConference hears party is focused on return to spirit of Belfast AgreementRally held in Dublin hears criticism of Government\u0026rsquos lack of urgency on housing issuesGarda\u0026iacute gave chase after vehicle failed to stop in Garryowen before men tried to flee on footYoung girl travelled to Netherlands with family last year to treat Dravet syndromeEx-Sinn F\u0026eacutein chief says: \u0026lsquoThe people that I know didn\u0026rsquot go to war.

The Department of Finance has looked at whether new legislation would be required for financial services in the event of a hard Brexit given that contracts in this area are governed by English law.The potential number of new customs and excise staff and additional resources required by the Revenue Commissioners to manage post-Brexit inspections and Border checks has also been explored by the department.“A massive amount of work has been going on across all Government departments to ensure Ireland is prepared for every eventuality with Brexit,” said a spokesman for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team.“We have to be prepared for a disorderly Brexit and that work is under way, it is contingency planning we hope never to have to use,” he added.The department has declined to release details of the planning contained within the documents as it was “still being processed and is extremely sensitive” with Brexit negotiations ongoing, said the spokesman.“It is not in the national interest for us to air our contingency planning for all to see during international negotiations which are of such fundamental importance for the future of the island,” he said.EU and UK negotiators have been meeting over the quiet Easter period in Brussels discussing for the first time potential ways to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.In a separate development, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted an invitation to visit Ireland again at the end of this month. Mr Barnier is expected to visit the Border and possibly Belfast when he visits for the Government’s next all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, comprising 1,500 civic society and industry representatives, in Dundalk, Co Louth. Ahead of that visit, Mr Coveney will continue his round of shuttle Brexit diplomacy, briefing foreign ministers of smaller EU countries over the coming week on Ireland’s concerns around the UK’s departure.Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva will visit Mr Coveney at Iveagh House in Dublin on Monday. The Tánaiste will meet the new Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, in The Hague on Wednesday.He will then host German foreign minister Heiko Maas in Dublin on Thursday. Ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday week Mr Coveney will host the foreign ministers of the EU’s Nordic and Baltic member states along with Mr Blok at a dinner the previous evening.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"the-agreement","story":"A central figure in Good Friday negotiations, PUP leader is on political margins, 20 years onFormer deputy leader of SDLP says deal has been damaged in some eyes, but it still has promiseTwo decades after it was signed, the agreement that underpins the peace looks vulnerableFormer US President will receive the award at a ceremony on April 10th in Ulster HallTwenty years ago, a team concluded negotiations that sealed Belfast AgreementThe 1998 accord did not end the Troubles, but it did result in extraordinary progressFormer SDLP leader says deal has been damaged but has not outlived its usefulnessDo our current leaders have the same skills as those who helped secure the Belfast Agreement?Officials in both governments acknowledge lack of chemistry between Varadkar and MayHave we seen the new beginning to policing which was promised asks Joanne Murphy?Some families have campaigned for over 40 years for truth and justiceBritish-Irish relationship is both bedrock of agreement and its driving force, writes Katy HaywardThe Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have staked their political reputations on the comprehensive peace package agreed\u0026hellipPerhaps, in time, the date will resonate in the collective memory of our children and our grandchildren, just as 1916 or 1912\u0026hellipWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayInvalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"asia-pacific","story":"CIA chief Mike Pompeo is leading preparations, CNN reportsSalman Khan (52) sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for 1998 offenceDisgraced ex-president Park Geun-hye\u0026rsquos 24-year sentence no surprise to populaceCase exposed dubious links between government and the \u0026lsquochaebol\u0026rsquo conglomeratesTokyo Letter: As they run out of things to do, officers are becoming more inventive\u0026lsquoDesperate measures\u0026rsquo include redrawing electoral map and \u0026lsquofake news\u0026rsquo crackdownThe women were told to leave a sumo ring while treating an official who had collapsedSalman Khan gets five-year prison sentenceAirline call for recosinderation of abrupt presidential order to close Boracay for six monthsSydney Letter: What so upset Peter Dutton was coverage of his new-found concern for white South African farmersGeneral Wei Fenghe says Chinese and Russian militaries are increasingly closeChinese couple are reunited with their child following her disappearance in 1994Threat to withdraw journalistic credentials under guise of fake news control cancelledChina reiterates adherence to religious freedom despite stalemate on Holy See dealNominee had nationality changed on website under pressure from BeijingThe \u0026ldquovast majority\u0026rdquo of the craft burnt up on re-entry, at around midnight, the Chinese space authority saidNobel laureate fails to elaborate on unrest in Rakhine state and exodus of Rohingya MuslimsEuropean agency forecasts re-entry between Sunday night and early Monday Irish timeK-pop singers perform in North for the first time in over 10 years as thaw gathers paceThe Pakistani activitist (20) was shot in the head by a masked Taliban gunman in 2012Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."}]
