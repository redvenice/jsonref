With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Not only did he have his own cabin, which cost around £20,000, he was years younger than anyone else on board.Quiet, unassuming and impeccably dressed in tailored chinos, a white safari hat and jacket, he introduced himself as 22-year-old William Baekeland, a British aristocrat and great-grandson of Leo Hendrik Baekeland, the Belgian-born inventor of Bakelite — the precursor to modern plastic.Rumours of this young man’s vast inherited wealth and grand heritage were soon rife, and he was quickly welcomed into the fold.His fellow travellers were so impressed by his status, encyclopaedic geographical knowledge and cut-glass accent it is claimed that they soon began to hand over huge sums of money for private expeditions William promised to organise.Little did they know the young man was not who he claimed to be. They now say that they have been left badly out of pocket.In an extraordinary tale of deception, William was not a multi-millionaire British aristocrat, but a former grammar school pupil from the West Midlands called Jesse Gordon. Instead of the homes he claimed to have across the world, including in London and Ireland, he in fact lived with his parents in a £130,000 ex-council house next to a Mecca Bingo hall in the Birmingham suburb of Great Barr.Justice for Helen: Mother demands a change in the law to...\u0027Thank you very much. See you soon. Love you all\u0027: Tragic...Share this articleUntil a few months ago, he managed to keep up this pretence and allegedly convinced dozens to hand over money for expeditions, some of which, to be fair, came to fruition and were declared great successes. But a great many more did not. Now he stands accused of taking £524,000 from 19 people for trips that failed to materialise.Although British police are investigating, few of his victims think they’ll see their money again. Today, there is a lot of anger and embarrassment among this community as to how the wool was pulled over their eyes.So how could this young man, without fame, fortune or ancestry, seemingly manage to hoodwink so many wealthy and experienced travellers into giving him so much money? And how could he keep up the ruse for so long?William, who is now 25, was born Jesse Gordon in Sutton Coldfield in 1993, the eldest of three children (he has two younger sisters, Jasmine, 22, and Grace, 19) of parents Simon Gordon, 62, a railway engineer and Mandy, 53, a housewife.Although his upbringing was relatively modest, he was an exceptionally bright child and obtained a place at King Edward VI Grammar School. Family holidays rarely went beyond Dorset, but from an early age he had a passion for geography and would study maps for hours.Childhood friend Joshua Radcliffe, 25, says: ‘He always wanted to see the world. It was an obsession with him.’          Instead of the homes he claimed to have across the world he in fact lived with his parents in a £130,000 ex-council house next to a Mecca Bingo hall in the Birmingham suburb of Great BarrBut it was not until he finished his degree in international politics and economics at Aberystwyth University in 2014 that William —who officially changed his name from Jesse to William Baekeland in the same year — began to seriously travel.Using a small inheritance from his grandparents, he bought a ticket on the Ortelius and set sail in March 2015, just days after celebrating his 22nd birthday. This was his debut into the community of extreme travellers, who he beguiled with tales of how he could pilot planes and the 100-plus countries he claimed to have visited already.And as they made the long journey together across icy waters, William revealed his plans for future expeditions, including a circumnavigation of Antartica. He depicted himself as a travel fixer, an explorer who could co-ordinate trips to the most far-flung and inhospitable places, with no expense spared for chartered yachts and security teams.Dominique Laurent, 67, a retired French financier and oil executive who has travelled to more than 170 countries, was a fellow passenger on this trip. He took in every word. ‘He looked like quite a wealthy guy although he was very young,’ he recalls. ‘I was very impressed by his knowledge.’Another passenger was British-Greek travel writer Harry Mitsidis, 46, one of only a handful of explorers to have visited every country in the world. By coincidence — and probably to William’s horror — the pair’s paths had crossed in 2013 when William, while still at university, had applied for an internship on Mr Mitsidis’s website. He was using the name Simon Baekeland.Although they’d they never met in person — the job was carried out remotely — subsequent checks by Harry into the intern’s CV revealed he had lied about his education, claiming to have attended the £17,000-a-year Harrodian school in London.He also said he had studied in North Korea for a month, as well as at exclusive international schools in Switzerland and Monaco. Needless to say, Harry ended William’s internship and did not hear from him again until he spotted him on the Ortelius.He says initially William went out of his way to avoid him, but with so much time together onboard (only 24 hours of the trip were ashore) they ended up talking. When Harry asked why William was no longer called Simon, he explained this was his middle name.Bowled over by his charm and geographical knowledge, Harry quietened his suspicions and put the CV discrepancies down to the different first name. ‘William could quote places like Kapingamarangi (an atoll of Micronesia). It goes beyond geek quirk — no one knows this kind of thing. We were all impressed and there was no questioning his legitimacy. He also had a very clear and upper crust English accent and you would think “Wow, this guy sounds like royalty”.‘He was sociable, too, and would come to dinner — what surprised me was the ease with which he conversed with people three times his age. We were partially dealing with a genius who was able to plan and execute behaviour in a precise way in order to achieve his goal. There was great attention to detail.’          William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the PacificWilliam’s choice of the Baekeland name, for example, was most likely meticulously researched. Although it is associated with the creation of Bakelite, it has a dark past, chronicled in the book and 2007 film, Savage Grace, starring Julianne Moore and Eddie Redmayne.This tells the story of Barbara Daly, the wife of Leo Baekeland’s grandson Brooks, who was murdered by her son Tony in 1972 after she had tried to ‘save him’ from his homosexuality by seducing him.In the face of such scandal, William told his enthralled travelling companions, he didn’t like talking about his personal life, and there was no information about his family online because they’d paid Google to delete the results.With contacts made and cash deposits taken for future trips, the cruise was a success and William began the next stage in his plan.He posted photographs on an Instagram account of his travels to exotic places, as well as pictures of him flying first class and in chartered planes and helicopters.In September 2016, he was interviewed for a podcast called Counting Countries, where he said he had visited 154 countries and recounted false tales of childhood expeditions. ‘We went on safaris quite a lot, we went to East Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia...we also went to the Congo.’ There was no mention of the family holidays to Dorset.Over the next year, William travelled extensively and organised a successful expedition to the remote Palmyra atoll 1,000 miles south of Hawaii, in the Pacific, and another to the sub-Antarctic Marion and Prince Edward Islands.In February 2017, he organised a trip for four people, including Dominique, to the remote Clipperton Island in the Pacific, for which Dominique paid £10,000. Three months later, he paid another £10,000 for a visit to the Central African Republic, which was a similarly small group tour. Both worked out well. ‘Our rate of confidence in him was 100 per cent afterwards,’ says Dominique.His reputation boosted by these successes, William continued to take orders, but by the autumn of 2017, trips started to fail to materialise. His explanations were typically outlandish. In a newsletter emailed to disappointed travellers following the cancellation of a trip to the Desventuradas Islands off the coast of Chile, he fabricated a story that his sisters, whom he called Muguette and Ariadne, had died from cancer and ‘weariness of life’ respectively.His mother, Lady Violette, he said, had travelled first class to the funeral in New York and paid for a separate seat for his sister’s teddy bear. He said they were buried in Sleepy Hollow cemetery, the same one where Leo Baekeland lies.In September, Dominique learned that William had failed to show up for a planned trip to South Sudan, reportedly stranding a Russian traveller who had paid £20,000. In an email sent by his ‘assistant’, William claimed he had been detained at Heathrow Airport.News of this ‘no show’ spread fast but Dominique and others weren’t worried. They were expecting to see him at a travel conference in Serbia a few weeks later. But again, William didn’t turn up. Then, a visit to Mali, which Dominique thankfully was not booked on, was suddenly cancelled. To date there has been no mention of a refund.          William posted this picture on Instagram at the camel market of El Fasher in Darfur, SudanPeople started communicating with each other about the tours they had booked with William and it is believed there were at least ten trips scheduled, from November 2017 to early 2019 — including the one he first planned on the Ortelius, the ‘irresistible’ South Antarctic circumnavigation.In total, Dominique claims he is owed £45,000 for expeditions including South Sudan, Somalia, Equatorial Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo which so far have not happened, and there is no suggestion that they will happen.With hindsight, Dominique says: ‘He was very cunning to be able to infiltrate an elite group of travellers and play the long game. I feel cheated. I’ve been travelling for decades and thought I was a good judge of character.‘There was also the feeling of frustration over not being able to visit those countries he said he was going to take us to.’ Dominique has reported what happened to the British police, but feels they did not take him very seriously.As for Harry, he was determined to get to the bottom of the story. He turned investigator and found no record of William’s birth in Britain, but instead a Jesse Simon Gordon with the same date of birth, who had registered and dissolved a travel company.Harry remembered he had received emails from someone of this name years ago, enquiring about expeditions. He then found a photograph of him on his sister’s Facebook account, and the penny dropped. ‘He was just an ordinary guy, with an ordinary family, from the suburbs of Birmingham, who it seems has managed to pull off an incredibly sophisticated act.’Furious, in November last year, Harry — who says he is owed almost £26,000 — sent an email to around 100 fellow travellers revealing William’s true identity, entitled ‘Apocalypse now, a bomb in our travel community’. He never heard from William again.But where is William Baekeland, aka Jesse Gordon, today?His family still lives in the same three-bedroom house in Birmingham, where William is said to be a regular visitor.His parents have refused to comment publicly, although his sister, Jasmine, told one newspaper how their ‘normal working-class parents’ had always believed their son to be a stockbroker in London.‘We are not particularly wealthy. We always stayed in England for our holidays. He was always travelling for months at a time and we did not understand how he could afford it,’ she said.Jasmine’s fiance, 22-year-old civil engineer Dylan Walton, was more scathing: ‘I don’t like him as he thinks he’s better than everyone else. But I can’t take away from him his genius. He’s got an amazing memory for all sorts of facts, trivia, history and geography. It’s just scandalous the stories he’s made up.          The \u0027baby-faced conman\u0027 is pictured here visiting the world\u0027s highest lake in Nepal‘When his parents found out he’d changed his name, he said it was because he was working for a secret Government agency. And for some reason, they just believe all his lies. He’s their golden boy.‘He loves the upper-class lifestyle and I always wondered where he was getting the money from.’For now, William is lying low and refusing to speak publicly about what happened, instead using his friend Joshua, with whom he set up a travel company last year — a separate venture to anything involved with this current debacle — as his spokesman.Joshua says: ‘I think he got a bit ahead of himself. He flew too close to the sun, he started to organise trips costing £40,000 to £50,000 instead of £3,000 to £4,000. If you pay so much for a chartered yacht and then don’t sell enough tickets, you lose the deposit.‘He should have been more upfront about his background, then he could’ve explained the situation. These are wealthy, entitled people who have looked to paint it all in a sinister light and I think it’s unfair. He will pay the money back.’A spokesman for City of London police, who investigate fraud, say they have received complaints against William and that this information has been ‘disseminated by our National Fraud Intelligence Bureau to West Midlands Police.’No action has yet been taken and for all those who say they have lost out, it remains to be seen whether they will ever see their money again. Whether we’ll see William Baekeland — and what guise he’ll take when he does emerge — also remains to be seen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/22/4CB54A1F00000578-0-image-m-105_1527541551853.jpg","title":"Downcast Morgan Freeman hides face girlfriend head set new film","story":"    Morose Morgan: Morgan Freeman was seen for the first time since multiple women accused the actor of harassment of inappropriate behavior in interviews with CNN (above)          Low profile: The Oscar-winning actor, 80, kept his eyes fixed on the ground and was led to a waiting SUV with his girlfriend by a bodyguard  Here\u0027s Johnny: He is in Savannah, Georgia filming The Poison Rose alongside John Travolta, but lost his longtime job with Visa in the wake of the scandal          Explanation: \u0027I admit that I am someone who feels a need to try to make women, and men, feel appreciated and at ease around me,\u0027 said Freeman in a statement last weekFreeman is currently at work filming The Poison Rose alongside John Travolta in Savannah, Georgia.He has managed to keep a low profile since the CNN story broke last week, but did release a statement responding to the allegations.\u0027I admit that I am someone who feels a need to try to make women, and men, feel appreciated and at ease around me,\u0027 said Freeman. \u0027As a part of that, I would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what I thought was a light-hearted and humorous way.

Parents of children classed as obese are sent warning letters.The figures were compiled by the Local Government Association who warned that children were ‘gaining weight at a drastic rate as they go through schools’.One in ten children were obese in reception, of whom 2.4 per cent were severely obese. Severe obesity is as bad for health as a lifetime of smoking and shortens life expectancy by ten years on average.It puts them at much risk of heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancer, which in turn place a huge strain on the NHS.

A severely obese boy of the same age and height would weigh almost 9st. The worst rates for severe obesity were in Barking and Dagenham, in east London, where 7.8 per cent of children leaving primary school were in the most dangerous weight category last year. They are only slightly better in Southwark, south London, at 7.2 per cent and in Wolverhampton at 7 per cent. But the rates are just 1.5 per cent in Wokingham, Berkshire, and 1.6 per cent in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Unless we tackle this obesity crisis, today’s obese children will become tomorrow’s obese adults whose years of healthy life will be shortened by a whole host of health problems.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ‘an indictment on successive Whitehall governments’, adding: ‘For decades they have failed to take the action required to help our children from becoming so unhealthily fat.’Professor Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Preventing children becoming overweight and obese is vital if we’re to stand any chance of beating the obesity epidemic. Not only does obesity have a high health cost for iniduals, it also has huge cost implications for the NHS.’A government scheme in 2014 spent £450million on providing healthy lunches for young children. It was scrapped last year and replaced with a programme giving free breakfasts in disadvantaged schools. Since 2013 schools have been given a ‘Sports Premium’ to improve PE lessons.The Government is due to announce a new childhood obesity strategy within weeks.A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have not ruled out further action if the right results are not seen.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/00/4CB6569000000578-5780735-Kishan_Takahashi_pictured_with_dog_Bonnie_who_had_treatment_for_-a-14_1527549037371.jpg","title":"Magical healers cured pets vets written off","story":"    Thomas the cat pictured with Clyde Hughes who also treated Dylan the dog.

He had to have an urgent operation and remained at the vet’s for five days.’Two years later it happened again, spontaneously. ‘The vet told us it would probably keep happening — there was obviously an underlying problem. Each time we were looking at £3,000 for an operation plus £1,000 for physio. The insurance wouldn’t pay out because it was a pre-existing condition.More importantly, could we keep putting Dylan through all that? The pain and surgery?‘The vet said we should consider putting him to sleep. It was an awful, awful time. Dylan’s so cheeky, extremely loyal, and losing him was unthinkable.’It was then that Nicci recalled how a friend’s Alsatian had been helped by a healer called Clyde Hughes.‘I wasn’t convinced — we were talking about a dog needing major spinal surgery — but my partner, Phil, said “What have we got to lose?”’ By the time they got to the clinic, Dylan had deteriorated. ‘He was looking at me as if to say, “Mum, give me a break!” and lying on the floor, unable to move. It was unbearable. ‘Clyde put a crystal either side of Dylan and ran a ining rod — like a wooden wand — over him. He put his hands on Dylan, saying there was a blockage in his energy in his back and he was channelling lots of good energy.

Without no deal as a credible option we have little negotiating power.’Fellow Tory Andrew Bridgen added: ‘Not preparing for no deal undermines our position and makes no deal more likely.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/09/4CB8C32B00000578-0-image-m-14_1527584196500.jpg","title":"EastEnders star Adam Woodyatt plans run alcohol delivery service","story":"The couple also run Neat Distillery Ltd, an online shop selling their own recipe gin for £39.95 a bottleOne resident living in Somers Place, which is adjacent to the proposed site, said: \u0027The residents of Somers Place should be allowed to live in relative peace in its backwater, situated in the middle of the conservation area without the additional inconvenience of delivery vans and their associated noise, blocking the already challenged road thus preventing vehicles from entering or exiting.\u0027Surely this activity would be better placed in a small unit on one of the many industrial estates outside of the town.\u0027Teenager, 18, who lied that ex-boyfriend drugged and raped...Is this the world\u0027s biggest ever Crunchy Nut Cornflake?...Labour members disrupt minute\u0027s silence for Tessa Jowell...Share this articleAnother resident added: \u0027This is a quiet area of the town.\u0027I can understand someone wanting to make money and run a business but it shouldn\u0027t be at the expense of the quality of life of the people who live nearby.\u0027The council will decide on the plans later this year.

Parents of children classed as obese are sent warning letters.The figures were compiled by the Local Government Association who warned that children were ‘gaining weight at a drastic rate as they go through schools’.One in ten children were obese in reception, of whom 2.4 per cent were severely obese. Severe obesity is as bad for health as a lifetime of smoking and shortens life expectancy by ten years on average.It puts them at much risk of heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancer, which in turn place a huge strain on the NHS.

A severely obese boy of the same age and height would weigh almost 9st. The worst rates for severe obesity were in Barking and Dagenham, in east London, where 7.8 per cent of children leaving primary school were in the most dangerous weight category last year. They are only slightly better in Southwark, south London, at 7.2 per cent and in Wolverhampton at 7 per cent. But the rates are just 1.5 per cent in Wokingham, Berkshire, and 1.6 per cent in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Unless we tackle this obesity crisis, today’s obese children will become tomorrow’s obese adults whose years of healthy life will be shortened by a whole host of health problems.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ‘an indictment on successive Whitehall governments’, adding: ‘For decades they have failed to take the action required to help our children from becoming so unhealthily fat.’Professor Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Preventing children becoming overweight and obese is vital if we’re to stand any chance of beating the obesity epidemic.

Without no deal as a credible option we have little negotiating power.’Fellow Tory Andrew Bridgen added: ‘Not preparing for no deal undermines our position and makes no deal more likely.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/20/4CB5E67D00000578-0-image-m-23_1527534623606.jpg","title":"Suspected Islamists behead 10 Mozambique local sources","story":"One of the victims was the chief of Monjane, a village near Palma in the country\u0027s north (pictured), in revenge for him telling police the location of their forest hideout The jihadists in October attacked a police station and military post in the town of Mocimboa da Praia, about an hour south of Palma.Two officers and 14 attackers were killed in what was believed to be the first jihadist attack in Mozambique.In the following weeks, at least 300 Muslims were arrested and several mosques forced to close. The group has no known link to the Somali jihadist group of the same name."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/10/4CB8C0BB00000578-0-image-a-43_1527586573572.jpg","title":"Impala flees pack ravenous wild dogs leap straight mouth HIPPO|js slshare link","story":"    The impala could be seen leaping into the water to get away from the pack of chasing wild dogs who were left standing on the river bank          The animal frantically swims away as it attempts to make its escape from the ravenous pack of dogs who nearly managed to snare it          After swimming for several moments uninterrupted the impala is snatched by the ferocious hippo in a lightning fast attackVERY hungry hippo!

There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

The difference between what the country brings in and sells abroad in terms of goods and services fell by £700m to £6.9bn in the three months to March 2018. However, when excluding services, Britain’s trade balance grew to £12.3bn, which was worse than analysts’ forecasts for a deficit of £11.3bn. The figures are likely to disappoint Brexit supporters looking for greater support for the economy from world trade. The British economy showed signs of having failed to bounce back from disruption triggered by the snow earlier in the year, with key barometers of business activity in the UK showing a muted recovery. The reading on the IHS MarkitCips all sector purchasing managers’ index rose to 53.2 in April, up from 52.5 in March when the “beast from the east” caused diggers and cranes to fall idle and shoppers to stay home. While that showed some progress, it was below the consensus estimate of 53.7 predicted by City economists on a gauge where 50 splits the difference between growth and contraction.Philip Hammond was handed good news from the government borrowing figures in the first month of the new financial year, as the budget deficit for April came in well below forecasts, boosted by stronger tax receipts and reduced spending. The figures showed public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was £7.8bn last month, versus an estimate of £8.6bn. The government’s annual spending shortfall for the last financial year to the end of March was also revised down by almost £2bn to £40.5bn, with the figures raising the prospect of the chancellor moving to loosen the purse strings at the budget later this year. Uncertainty triggered by Brexit, coupled with tax changes and consumers coming under pressure from inflation and weak wage growth have played havoc with the housing market since the referendum. Over the past month, the closely-watched Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) gauge of house prices dropped to the lowest level since 2012. The index, which measures the balance of surveyors expecting price rises fell to -8 in April from zero in March. That was worse than a Reuters poll of economists for a reading of -1.

In echoes of the euro crisis earlier this decade, these events could ultimately threaten the future of the EU, or at the very least, question it in its current form.Whilst it is no surprise that Italian yields have soared and equities plunged as investors reprice the actual risk of holding Italian assets, this crisis has been on the cards for some time and shows how complacent financial markets have become in the era of quantitative easing. At the same time there has been a noticeable slowdown in growth across the EU this year which will also continue to weigh on sentiment towards both Italian and EU wide assets. Throw in heightened geopolitical risks in other parts of the world such as the US and Asia, rising interest rates and the reduction in central bank support through quantitative easing, then the outlook for financial markets is far less certain than over the past few years. Here’s Reuters’ latest report on the volatility in the markets:A deepening political crisis in Italy, the euro zone’s third biggest economy, fuelled a heavy selloff in Italian assets and the euro reminiscent of the euro zone debt crisis of 2010-2012.Short-term Italian bond yields, which move inversely to price, were set for their biggest one-day jump since 1992, while Italian and wider euro zone banking stocks were set to suffer their worst day since August 2016.Italy’s president has set the country on a path to fresh elections by appointing a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister, with the task of planning for snap polls and passing the next budget.The concern is that fresh elections could deliver an even stronger mandate for Italy’s anti-establishment, eurosceptic politicians.“The spectacular rise of 2-year yields in Italy this morning reflects break-up or redenomination fears,” Martin van Vliet, ING Bank’s senior fixed income strategist, said.Earlier Italy sold €5.5bn worth of six month bonds, but at the highest yield for more than five years.There are more sales due on Wednesday - up to €6bn in five year and ten year bonds.US markets are expected to open lower in the wake of the European declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average forecast to lose around 190 points at the start of trading.Not sure this is an entirely helpful remark from the European Central Bank’s Vitor Constancio. When asked about any ECB help for Italy he is quoted as saying: “Italy knows the rules. They might want to read them again.”Any intervention by the European Central Bank to help Italy in the event of liquidity problems must meet the bank’s mandate and “certain conditions”, its outgoing Vice-President was quoted as saying on Tuesday.“Italy knows the rules. They might want to read them again,” Vitor Constancio told Spiegel magazine in an interview, according to a pre-release, when asked if the central bank would intervene if needed and rescue Italy from insolvency.The ECB’s never-used emergency bond buying scheme -- known as Outright Monetary Transactions or OMT -- is a potential tool to help Italy but comes with a long list of conditions.For a country to be eligible for OMT, it must be in a European Financial Stability FacilityEuropean Stability Mechanism adjustment or precautionary programme and support must be warranted from a monetary policy perspective.A deepening political and constitutional crisis in Italy, the euro zone’s third biggest economy, fuelled a sharp rise in the country’s short-term borrowing costs on Tuesday and renewed selling in the euro and stocks. Back with the markets, and analyst Joshua Mahony at IG, says:With markets transfixed on affairs in Italy and Spain (amid a vote of no confidence for Rajoy), we are seeing a sharp shift into safe haven assets, driving the Japanese yen and gold prices higher in recent days. FTSE 100-listed gold producers Fresnillo and Randgold are the best performers in the bluechip index in early trade amid a shift into gold. We often see stocks benefit when currencies come under pressure, but the flight to safety this morning means the euro and the pound are also getting another pounding alongside the stock market declines.Away from markets for a moment, and some good news for Pret A Manger employees after the takeover deal, as tweeted by the chain’s chief executive:Moody’s, which recently put Italy’s Baa2 credit rating on review for a downgrade, has commented on the latest developments.It said Italy was likely to be downgraded if the next government pursued fiscal policies which were not sufficient to place the public debt ration on a sustainable downward trajectory in the coming years.Its rating could be confirmed if there was an ambitious programme of structural reform by the next government.Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets, says:We’ve seen a steep selloff in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy. Whilst a lot has already been written on the topic, the moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the Eurozone debt crisis.The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe. The one thing that has become apparent is that markets treated the election result with excessive calm and has been jolted by the populists’ success in agreeing terms...Eurozone breakup risks are higher, although they remain small overall (unless you take the long term view that every empire falls at some point and the EU is no different). If snap elections produce a clearer mandate for the populists and they succeed again in forming a government, Italy heads for a collision for the EU shortly after. EU and Eurozone rules are far too inflexible to handle radical domestic policy shifts of this kind and based on experience of Brexit negotiations, Italy could not hope for the EU rule makers to back down. A disorderly Italexit would be nasty enough but as a founding member of the club it would be a moment that the bloc would not recover from. The chief risk is that the developments over the last week lead to a snap election that becomes in effect a referendum on membership of the euro. The two main populist parties may well step up their anti-euro, and anti-EU positions.The head of Italy’s central bank has said the country’s economy is recovering and growth is increasingly self sustained, but said any move to weaken the country’s public finances could undermine confidence and years of valuable reforms.Ignazio Visco, speaking to the bank’s annual meeting, made the comments amid the political turmoil which is likely to lead to a new election, with euro membership likely to be among the main issues for voters.Visco added that moderate growth and gradually rising inflation were the most likely path for Italy.He said he expected Italy’s smaller banks to come up with plans to tackle non-performing loans by the autumn, with a quarter of them showing a negative return on equity.He said Italy must press on with reforms, and there were no short cuts for cutting debt. “We are only ever a few short steps away” from a serious risk of losing trust, he said.The market rout is intensifying, in the wake of the Italian political crisis.But the yields on UK gilts have fallen to their lowest levels this year as investors seek havens for their cash amid the turmoil."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9527e20aa0f4e3105c860042322588cdbebc884c/0_17_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42f850c5ef8e29dd29540a2c86d87d8","title":"mother of all rivers volga russia kazan samara volgograd","story":"The World Cup will be the first time most westerners will be exposed to the great cities of the Volga – and their tense tug-of-war over identityby  Andrew Roth, Moscow correspondent. All photographs by Dmitri Beliakov for the The World Cup will be the first time most westerners will be exposed to the great cities of the Volga – and their tense tug-of-war over identityby  Andrew Roth, Moscow correspondent. All photographs by Dmitri Beliakov for the The Alexander Nevsky is a dingy time machine that bears 196 passengers – war veterans bound for the city formerly known as Stalingrad side by side with boozy weekenders – down the Volga river like a floating Soviet sanatorium.It was built in East Germany in 1957 by the shipbuilders of Wismar, who sent 49 comfort-class riverboats to their new brothers across the Soviet bloc.Not much on board has changed since.Crooners belt out Soviet ballads and pensioners sun themselves on flimsy deckchairs. The cheaper cabins below deck show their years, smelling of musk and occasionally varnish, with chipped, frosted glass on the cabin doors. When the nights are cold, passengers wrapped in woollen blankets walk in circles from bow to stern to bow again, as barges with salt and timber pass in the dark.“Not everyone can handle travel like this in a closed space,” said Viktor Chekhovskikh, a passenger and former sailor who has captained Volga riverboats himself for 25 years, and who passes the days in his private cabin building custom model ships – of Imperial Russian Navy vessels, or the tankers he sailed on in the Black Sea in his youth.Many of its sister ships have long since been retired, but each summer the Nevsky plies the 2,193 miles of the great river. Crooked like an elbow, the Volga passes from the Valdai hills near Moscow down to Astrakhan by the Caspian Sea.Four of the 11 host cities for this summer’s World Cup sit on this river. For many foreigners, the world’s biggest football event will also mark their first interaction with these erse Volga cities, far from the touristy streets of Moscow and St Petersburg.Nizhny Novgorod, once called Gorky and closed to foreigners, and the second world war “hero city” of Volgograd – formerly Stalingrad – will host England matches. Games will also be played in the Tatar capital of Kazan and in Samara, the aeronautics hub that produced jet fighters and space rockets.Russia’s answer to the Mississippi, the Volga ties them all together – a thread through the Povolzhye region that for decades has drawn artists and explorers in search of an authentic Russia among its farmers and barge-haulers. Last month it drew myself and the photographer Dmitri Beliakov, who joined me on a boat down the river, in pursuit of a similar goal. Moscow and St Petersburg have embraced globalised tastes and careful urban planning, but what of Russia’s other cities – the heartland?“Every Russian man should sail the Volga at least once in his life,” Margarita Petrovna, a prim blockade survivor in a cardigan, said over a dinner of spaghetti and stewed beef in the Nevsky’s dining hall.The Volga was old Rus’s frontier with the Tatar east. Centuries later, the Soviets harnessed the river for the country’s postwar industrialisation through a cascade of dams. Tolstoy wrote fairytales about the river, and Chekhov took a river cruise for his honeymoon.Joseph Roth, the Austrian-Jewish novelist and journalist, observed in 1926 how the farmers who stormed first class after the Bolshevik revolution found it awkward and eventually returned to steerage by choice. In the end, Roth also jumped ship and joined barge haulers on a ferry instead.I too was sailing in coach, on the lower deck, more or less the lowest class there is. The ship was due to arrive on Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany.We set sail from Kazan at dusk, the ship’s loudspeakers playing Farewell of Slavyanka, a military march. In the distance, the white and azure minarets of the Qol Sharif mosque jumped out of the gloom.More than 500 years ago, Kazan was the capital of a Muslim khanate that rivalled Moscow for influence. Anthony Jenkinson, the explorer and first English envoy to Russia, arrived in the city just six years after it had been conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552, bearing letters of introduction from the tsar.The tug-of-war over religious and ethnic identity continues in Kazan to this day. The state promotes an official, loyalist Islam, watched over by a religious committee. Moscow has pushed Kazan to scale back Tatar-language classes in school, which causes the local activists to bristle, though they carefully avoid open conflict.“It isn’t about plotting a course against Russia, but fighting against inertia, fighting for our culture as an equal,” said Rozalina Shageeva, an art historian and poet who writes in Russian and Tatar. “Without our language, who are we as a people?”The neighbourhood of Old-Tatar Sloboda, where Tatars settled in the 16th century after being expelled from the inner city, is more museum than living city these days. At its centre is the Märcani mosque, which has benefited from the state’s largesse ever since Catherine the Great approved its construction in 1766, breaking two centuries of tradition. It was the city’s first stone mosque, and the only one to remain open under the Soviet Union.The imam, Mansur Hazrat Dzhalyaletdin, and I strolled through the cavernous mosque – the banquet halls, the kindergarten where children recite Qur’an verses from memory, the bridal shop with modest dresses decorated with lace flowers. A vacation brochure for nearby Kazan Halal City includes an Islamic college, a travel agency, a hotel complex, a souvenir shop and an apiary in the forest.For Dzhalyaletdin, the link between religion and the state is innate – a partnership illustrated by the pictures of Vladimir Putin and other officials on his sitting room wall.“Yes, the constitution says that religion is separate from the state, but our people are believers,” he said. During communism, he said, the people had faith in the party. When that disappeared, their faith brought them to the mosques. “How can you separate the people from their government? It’s forbidden.”Across town, the Mirgaziyan mosque has a more bitter history: it was seized by police in 2013 after extremism charges were brought against a former imam. The mosque was built from a Soviet boiler room and its minaret was fashioned from a 72ft brick chimney. Its founder, Mirgaziyan Salavatov, chose the site after his dead wife appeared to him in a dream and repeated “111” until he awoke. He interpreted that as the street address where he should establish the mosque, which he called Al-Ikhlas, or The Purity. It opened in 2004.The current imam, Azgar Hazrat Valiullin, grew up poor in rural Tatarstan, and had always worked with his hands. He was the one who repaired the minaret, climbing the 22 metres and cementing down the loose bricks in two rows. He was there one Friday in 2006 when Salavatov came to him and asked him to “safeguard the mosque”. The next day, he said, Salavatov died of a stroke. In 2013, control of the mosque was transferred to the state. Law enforcement accused a dozen congregants of ties to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a Sunni political movement that has called for an Islamic caliphate. The movement is banned in Russia. Its supporters say they are peaceful.The mosque was condemned as unsafe and the brick minaret torn down. It was rebuilt under a different name.Valiullin, who has a white tufted goatee and wears a velvet-blue taqiyah, shakes his head when he recalls the arrests. He denies links to the banned movement, and says he believes some of the young men were mistreated in prison.As to the minaret, he sighed, “They tore it down for nothing.”The Alexander Nevsky sailed through the night and arrived at the dam by Zhiguli the next day. It is one of eight hydroelectric works in the Volga cascade systems, which stretch from the city of Dubna, north of Moscow, all the way down to Volgograd. For a few years after 1961, the Volga hydroelectric station was the largest in the world.The journalist Bruce Chatwin, who sailed down the river with German veterans and war widows in 1982 for the Observer, wrote that the dams had “turned this Mother-of-all-the-Rivers into a chain of sluggish inland seas the colour of molasses”.But inside the great locks, there is a majestic moment as the metal doors part to reveal hills dotted with fir and pine or a fading riverside village, like a snapshot framed in rust. On one of the lock walls someone has etched: “We won’t forget you. Petya Savkin ...” There’s more written but it has been erased by the daily rise and fall of the waters.Yelena Sedykh, 62, pointed toward the dacha in a sunlit valley just across the Volga from Samara. It brought up memories of her son, she said, who died a decade earlier of cancer. She prefers to spend weekends at the dacha with her husband and daughter now, but decided on a weekend trip just to “get away from everything”.In Samara’s heyday, which passed a century ago, local merchants made it rich on the city’s grain commodity exchange and the city’s growth rate was compared to Chicago’s. The newly rich built themselves ornate wooden houses and art nouveau mansions with asymmetrical facades and butterfly ornaments, a break from the concrete monotony in most post-Soviet cities. During the second world war, Samara – then known as Kuybishev after a Soviet revolutionary – briefly hosted the Soviet government and foreign embassies as the alternate capital to Moscow. After the war, the city closed itself off to foreigners as a base for aerospace production.The city has about 140 blocks downtown with historical wooden or wood-and-brick buildings, said Andrey Kotchetkov, a local journalist and activist. As interest from developers for valuable downtown real estate has increased, so have grassroots attempts to stop the wooden houses from being condemned or burned to the ground in arson attacks.“People don’t understand what a valuable thing it is,” Kotchetkov said during a tour through the city. “They talk about Europe but don’t realize what they have around them.”Kotchetkov founded the Tom Sawyer Fest, a yearly volunteer festival to restore blighted houses. It’s only in its fourth year, but the movement has snowballed into prominence. One rule? Politicians can’t use it as a photo op. That evening the sun set over the Volga and turned the sky a shimmering purple. Kuybishev Street, the city’s main avenue, has been touched up, while the roads through the less scenic manufacturing zone will be closed for the World Cup.Samara is unusual for a Volga city for not having a bridge to the other side, and the island across the river is mostly pristine.Each monk is assigned work duties. Dmitry Voskresensky, dour but with a good sense of humour, was assigned to breed sturgeon.“When the father blessed me he said: ‘Dmitry, your job is the fish,’” Voskresensky recalled. “I had no idea what he was talking about.”Born in the Urals, Voskresensky served his military service in missile silos north of the Arctic Circle before entering the monkhood. Asked why he’d come, he said: “That’s between me and the father.”The monastery, founded in 2006 near a waterfront village, has a lax atmosphere, he said, and should be walled off from the outside world.Villagers can appear uninvited. “Sometimes without clothes on,” he added.In a storeroom, Voskresensky keep tubs full of Russian sturgeon, beluga and starlet. It’s still a small operation, but he has built it from scratch, learning through trial and error to engineer pumping systems and the basics of marine biology with the goal of farming meat and roe. The fish farm is just starting to become self-sufficient and yield caviar, he said. The next step is to scale it up exponentially.Voskresensky said his ultimate goal is to repopulate the Volga. With reasonable yearly growth, he estimates, that will take something like 500 years.On the road back we drop into Mezhdurechensk, a roadside town on an isthmus between the Volga and Usa rivers that hosts a well-known fish market, where women hawk dried perch, grayling, bream and burbot. The fattier fish come from the slow-moving Usa, they say, the ones with more muscle from the Volga.A fisherman’s daughter in her 20s named Lena, her black hair combed forward in a fringe, said the fishermen pay in product for the fishmongers to sell their goods. They would be down in the waterfront dugouts, she said, but it was spring and they are banned from fishing during the spawning period. Only commercial boats like the Nevsky can sail the Volga at this time of year.The streets were empty in Volgograd the morning of the Victory Day parade. It had been warmer on board the previous night as the ship made its final leg down to Volgograd. The bar was doing brisk business. Two teenage boys struck up a Stevie Wonder tune on guitar and a drunk businessman from Moscow sauntered up. “I want to give you money,” he said, holding out £25 in rubles. The singer, the slighter of the two boys, accepted it. The other looked on in horror.Volgograd itself is a dusty city in the great steppe. It stretches for miles like a banana around the bended Volga. At nearly any point in the city, it is difficult to forget its wartime legacy: 1.9 million were killed, wounded or captured in the bloodiest battle of all time.At a walkthrough of the city’s new stadium for next month’s World Cup, construction director Sergei Kamin said builders had found the remains of 386 shells and two Soviet soldiers on the building site.The parade in Volgograd turned out to be more reserved than Moscow’s. No intercontinental ballistic missiles made an appearance on the square, and the only relish came from an announcer rolling his r’s endlessly as he introduced the Tornado multiple rocket launcher, which passed the Intourist Hotel on to the Square of the Fallen Fighters.The real display came later, as tens of thousands of people made the pilgrimage up the Mamayev Kurgan hill to the Motherland Calls statue, which stands monumental at 280ft tall. The hill’s steepness gave the impression that the procession was balanced on a ridge-top. Ushers kept errant children off the grass, part of a mass grave of soldiers who died on the hill.“The atmosphere was eerie, and religious: all too easy to scoff at but the crowds, with their rapt and reverential expressions, were no scoffing matter,” Chatwin wrote of the climb in 1982.Valeria Petrovna, 68, who did not give a last name, climbs the hill each year with a religious procession to honour her father. He survived the battle but was never quite himself again, and withdrew in his final years. “My mother says he died here,” she said. “But I know that he was alive … with the understanding of the cruelty a people can inflict on another.”To reach Vladimir Kharchenko’s experimental motorbike workshop, meanwhile, you have to drive north past the old T-34 factory and across the great Volgograd dam into a quiet neighbourhood of factories.There, if you’re lucky, he’ll bring out his prized motorcycle and even take a spin around the block, weaving in and out of traffic over potholed roads. It’s the same one he custom-made for the Surgeon, a celebrity motorcycle-gang leader who has pledged fealty to Vladimir Putin and rode the motorcycle in the annexed city of Sevastopol in 2015.The bike’s name? The Stalinist. It’s written right on the engine.In his office, Kharchenko sat under a portrait of Stalin that he was told is an original. “This country was self-sufficient under Stalin, we were independent,” he said. Asked about those killed and repressed, he said western countries are no better. “What did Stalin want for his country? The rise of the country. Who ended up in the gulag? People who opposed that.”“These days you need to write bad things about Stalin, you need to write bad things about Putin, and show that in Europe,” he told a reporter. “But I think as long as things get worse with the United States, you’re going to see Stalin become more popular.”Valeria Petrovna, the woman on the hill, had a different opinion. “I think we’ve had enough of that time in general, and I don’t see much reason to go back,” she said, and excused herself to walk further up the hill.The Nevsky will take nearly three days straight back upstream to Kazan, with just five hours stop in Samara for passengers to stretch their legs. Chekhovskikh, the captain, says the longest journeys down the Volga can take three weeks, with some passengers opting to stay on the boat the whole time rather than tour the cities they pass.On the back deck one evening, two middle-aged couples were deep in their cups discussing the intricacies of Islam – and particularly circumcision. Mikhail, 47, owns a handful of garages in Samara and has taken a half-dozen Volga cruises, both toward Moscow and Astrakhan. “I never travel to Europe, barely to Moscow if I can avoid it,” he declared proudly. Then he swept his hand across the water and praised the Volga, and the city of Kazan. “There’s really nowhere else in Russia like it. Of course we’re different from them in some ways, this whole thing with religion – but can you really visit that city and not be proud of the history and of the fate that brought you together?”For more on life inside the Russian cities hosting the World Cup, visit  Cities or follow on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289523c88802950c52d7886656c3f4fd69b9328/0_7_4238_2543/master/4238.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c5d2c78528844409dc0989a820e87","title":"russia stray dogs world cup cull sochi yekaterinburg","story":"After the mass culls before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, animal rights activists in the World Cup cities of Sochi and Yekaterinburg fear history could be repeating itselfEarlier this year, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, met with animal rights activist to discuss their fears that stray dogs would be exterminated ahead of the football World Cup. Mutko pledged to stop all cruelty, and said he had ordered the construction of shelters for stray animals.But activists allege dog killings have continued and that Mutko’s words are meaningless as city governments are not compelled to follow recommendations made at a federal level.“If you put it in plain Russian, they said ‘sod off, we’re going to carry on killing’,” says Yekaterina Dmitriyeva, the head of NGO the Foundation for the Protection of Urban Animals, who was present at the meeting. She set up the popular Facebook group, Bloody Fifa-2018, last year.There are approximately two million strays in Russia’s 11 World Cup host cities and it has been estimated that local authorities will spend up to £119 million on catching, caging, sterilising and euthanising animals this year.But activists warn that image-conscious officials are trying to remove strays from the streets by fair means or foul before the arrival of players and fans next month.While contracts to regulate the number of stray dogs are won by private companies in Russia annually, there is some evidence that the size of these tenders have been increased this year. An online petition launched by Dmitriyeva late last year calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cancel contracts ahead of the World Cup has almost two million signatures, but there has been no response from the Russian leader, who is known to have several pet dogs and often speaks about his love for animals.Though Russian cities’ policies about stray animals differ, these contracts can be extremely lucrative. In the World Cup host city Yekaterinburg, for example, the state is paying £380,000 for the capture of 4,650 dogs. Some Russians have even advertised their properties online as housing for dogs during the World Cup, hoping for a financial windfall as the companies that won tenders struggle to cope.Russian officials deny euthanasia is state policy, and some NGOs say the same. The allegations of mass extermination are just “gossip”, says Yekaterina Ublinskaya, deputy director of Right to Life, an animal rights NGO operating in the western exclave of Kaliningrad, which won a £21,400 contract to provide temporary accommodation for dogs picked up off the streets for the World Cup. “There are some instances of poisoning, but these are private incidents and there is no mass poisoning.”But even top animal welfare officials have admitted there have been cases of animal cruelty linked to the World Cup preparations. Vladimir Burmatov, the head of the Russian parliament’s committee on ecology and environment protection, was horrified when he visited a dog shelter in Yekaterinburg earlier this year. “The effect from what I saw was very painful. Malnourished dogs and conditions that you couldn’t even call satisfactory,” Burmatov wrote afterwards.He said a “large quantity” of dogs were being put down unnecessarily for £1.20 each – a price strongly indicating the methods used were likely not humane. He also revealed that the company running the shelter was not an animal specialist organisation, but focused on rubbish collection and disposal. Fears about the treatment of animals ahead of the World Cup have been fuelled by activists’ experience of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi when they say homeless dogs were exterminated in a coordinated campaign. The fate of Sochi’s strays became an international scandal before the tournament as photographs appeared of dogs dying in the streets and activists desperately tried to evacuate them from the city. In protest, some Olympic athletes adopted Sochi dogs and took them back to their respective countries and, in one case, dedicated an Instagram account to them. There are fears that what happened in Sochi could be repeated in all Russia’s World Cup cities, as well as in Sochi itself, which is hosting World Cup matches including those of footballing giants Germany and Spain. “We are scared there will be a repeat of what happened before the Olympics when, over a week, there were mass poisonings and shootings,” said Ksenia, a Sochi-based animal rights activist. Documents on the state procurement website show that Basya Service, the company that carried out the culls before the Sochi Olympics, has won four contracts to catch 3,501 stray dogs and cats in 2018. Angry officials in a village in the nearby Tuapse district pledged to tear up a similar agreement with the company earlier this year after the remains of dead dogs were found by the side of the road. The mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, has denied the city has authorised the killing of stray animals and says there are no plans to do so before the World Cup. Basya Service also denies that it uses inhumane methods. But Sochi activists are calling on their local networks to watch out for those targeting stray dogs and to film, obstruct or call the police about any animal cruelty.The situation is less volatile in other World Cup host cities. In the western city of Kaliningrad and the Volga city of Nizhny Novgorod – both due to host the English team during the group stages – local activists say authorities use a “Trap, Neuter, Return” policy . In Moscow, killings are rare.  In Kaliningrad, Ublinskaya said clearing dogs from the streets during the World Cup was actually in the animals’ best interests. “During such events, there are a lot of people – not always sober – and it is best to have animals as far away as possible.” But activists point out that euthanasia programmes allow much greater scope for corruption: while it is relatively simple to check whether a stray dog has been sterilised and tagged, it is almost impossible to tell if dogs have been killed and whether corners have been cut.“It’s a catastrophe,” says activist Dmitriyeva. “How do they choose who lives and who dies?”More on life inside Russian cities hosting the World Cup can be found here, or follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2c2bb8510465651cfedc4a7f0867cb1bdc434bd/0_204_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de7606f7214fdcd0065e8a2d5eb22d19","title":"worst store britain wh smith stationery","story":"Back in the early 90s, WH Smith was one of the strongest contenders on the British high street, a paradise of books, magazines and trendy back-to-school merchandise. Only John Lewis and Marks \u0026amp Spencer could eclipse the brand’s popularity. So it should be shocking to learn that it has been voted the “worst store” in the country, called out in a Which? survey for its poor service, high prices and shabby shops. Except this is the fifth time in eight years that it has come bottom in Which?’s rankings. In 2017 Waterstones’ boss James Daunt slammed WH Smith’s shops for their “godawful uniformity” and “crushing consistency”.Yet although the retailer has lost some of its sparkle, it’s still one of my favourites on the high street.Growing up without access to social media or face-distorting apps, I knew no better way to spice up the weekend than a trip to my local WH Smith. I would happily spend an afternoon flicking through Sweet Valley High novels and colourful comics, carefully calculating how to invest my hard-earned pocket money. While other kids played outside, I’d forgo all cardio-based activities for the chance to sit on the greying carpet and immerse myself in the land of the Wakefield twins or the Babysitters Club. I may have been living in a small, grey town in the north-west of England, but in the quiet aisles of a WH Smith, I could explore other worlds and places.It wasn’t just the wide range of teen cult novels that kept me going back. By the time I started high school in 1995, I’d discovered my local branch’s ever-growing stationery section, featuring endless shelves of Hello Kitty rubbers and the explosive gel pens that were banned from almost every classroom in the country. A trip to the store became an annual September ritual, where I’d hunt for the coolest new pencil case to decorate with Tippex and declarations of undying love to the spotty teenage boys in year 10. When it came to the tastes of 90s teenagers, no one had their finger on the pulse quite like WH Smith.Fast forward two decades and the store remains a British icon – but it no longer seems to attract browsers and serious shoppers in the same way. It’s become known as a last-minute pit stop, full of cranky parents ransacking the shelves for sweets to silence the cries of their children on long-distance journeys. Like many other high street retailers, it has lost its personality, with smiley staff replaced by self-serve checkouts. For some consumers the gaudy blue branding is another bugbear, with many Which? respondents claiming that WH Smith has gone downmarket.But despite the messy shelves and lack of personalised service, it seems that we’re not ready to give up on the retailer just yet. Profits remain steady, suggesting there’s still a chance to restore the public’s faith in the brand.And we shouldn’t forget that WH Smith continues to promote books and encourage literacy among all ages and backgrounds. As author Joanne Harris commented, “While it may not be the coolest shop on the High Street, research suggests that WH Smith, and not Waterstone’s, is the place where most working-class people buy books.” I hope the chain can finally take the criticism on board, and deliver what its customers really want. With a minor facelift, more investment in customer service and greater focus on books and authors, it could be on track for a revival. Woolworths’ pick ‘n’ mix may be a sad and distant memory, but there’s still hope for WH Smith."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75f2db7d573521cc8a3e9a77bb45fb7dcf27ce10/0_35_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6817482fd8ae2e71dce31838129536","title":"peter kays car share reaches end of the road","story":"Resisting the drive towards sentimentality, Kay delivers a high achievement in 21st century TV comedyThree years and 12 TV half-hours ago, supermarket assistant manager John Redmond (Peter Kay) first gave sales rep colleague Kayleigh Kitson (Sian Gibson) a lift to work as part of their company’s carshare scheme. On Monday at 10.29pm, their flirtatious friendship, as stop-start as the Lancashire traffic they negotiate in morning and evening rush hours, was finally resolved in what the BBC1 continuity announcer billled as the “final ever episode” of Peter Kay’s Car Share.Kay, a proper scholar of TV comedy, knows that the one of the biggest decisions in a sitcom is how far the show departs from the central situation. There’s a tension for viewers in threat that the successful set-up will be jettisoned. With typical sophistication, Kay and co-star Gibson (who have written the series with Paul Coleman and Tim Reid) played with various deviations from the series’ dominating shot of the two retail employees seat-belted in the front of John’s red Fiat 500L, with its WR62 XDF plate.For the first 10 minutes, the passenger seat beside John was empty, a consequence of the row between the couple at the end of the second series, screened in May 2017.Kayleigh was now commuting solo by bus and train. The show kept teasing about whether it would deliver the generally desired romantic clincher that fans have been demanding (100,000 signed a petition) after an apparent Richard Curtis-like ending to season two, with John finally declaring his passion for Kayleigh in a traffic jam, turned out to have been one of the series’ periodic fantasy sequences.Another Curtisian touch – a love song (“Come back, my car share buddy!”) recorded by John and delivered at dawn on a Walkman to Kayleigh’s house, got them back in tandem in the Fiat a third of the way in. John’s rationale for giving things a go with Kayleigh was, fittingly, that “you make me laugh.” But rows and then the road accident of which the storyline has always carried the possibility tantalised with the possibility of another unhappy ending, until, in a satisfying twist on the show’s central visual image, the lovers had to have their first official cuddle on a bus.Making viewers wait and sweat for the ending they desired confirmed the suspicion that Kay, like his character, resists the drive towards sentimentality that the audience desires. The first half of the two-part finale, an unscripted and non-sequential special shown on 7 May, had exposed a comedy that is generally gentle (except for occasional swearing that gives the DVD releases a 15 certificate) to significant controversy for the first time. Some viewers objected to a conversation in which John and Kayleigh reacted satirically to the playing of a request for a transgender man on Forever FM.No such Twitter-storm threatened the final episode, but there was evidence of a wish to keep some edge. The signature punctuating cutaways of north-west urban life and the witlessly optimistic drivel on the car radio of the drivetime presenters on the fictional Forever FM were more consistently filthy than ever before, as if to add some salt to the sugar of the conclusion. Glimpsed from the vehicle were signs warning against “dogging” and an advertising hoarding on which the line “don’t drive like a” was followed by a picture of a cockerel. The radio ads included come-ons for a drink called “love juice” and a “name the year” quiz had a saucy gag about Monica Lewinsky.There was also a hint of in-jokes. John had two speeches about his desire for “privacy”, a right that Kay, who controls media access more than most celebrities, fiercely protects for himself. And a final sub-plot, in which the couple had both been invited to the December 28 wedding of workmates Donna and Rick, seemed designed to lay down the tantalising basis for a Christmas special at some point in the future.A significant television event in any case, the final episode has also taken on an exaggerated significance in Kay’s career. This was a rare example of a TV departure also being a comeback, as this is the first Kay work to be seen since he cancelled for what have been described only as “unforeseen family reasons” a fourteen-month UK stand-up comedy tour that was due to begin last month. If the original plans had stood, the early gigs would have been a warm-up for the last look at Car Share now the latter was a compensation for the loss of seeing the former.With Kay apparently on sabbatical at the moment, it’s impossible to know what he might do next. But Car Share will stand as one of the highest achievements of 21st century TV comedy, containing a combination of warmth and cleverness, social observation and romance, originality and nods to TV comedy history that only Kay could achieve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616179d4fb47b2465edad7621da8f20a8df0b2ac/285_0_3715_2229/master/3715.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337d5cbc3006ac63c5fa347d48905977","title":"oxford and cambridge university colleges own property worth 35bn","story":"News of bigger portfolio than Church of England comes after £21bn in total assets revealedOxford and Cambridge colleges collectively own more land than the Church of England and have a portfolio of properties across the UK worth £3.5bn, a  investigation has found.From a Scottish castle conquered by Robert the Bruce and the O2 arena in Greenwich to a betting shop in Brent, north-west London, the land and buildings owned by the universities’ colleges encompass ancient and modern possessions amounting to 51,000 hectares (126,000 acres) – an area more than four times the size of Manchester.The Oxbridge holdings dwarf the 42,000 hectares owned across 41 dioceses by the Church of England, which is often said to be the UK’s largest private landowner.The figures follow the revelation on Monday that estates, endowments, investments and other assets held by Oxford and Cambridge are collectively worth almost £21bn. The property details come from the most extensive survey of Oxbridge landholdings since 1873, through a combination of freedom of information requests, archival research and Land Registry records.The property holdings of Oxbridge colleges are worth a combined £3.5bn, while the universities collectively hold property investments worth £863m. These figures do not take into account the value of many historic college sites, which are held at depreciated cost.The total size does not include unmeasured land held by several colleges “under ancient possession”, or the holdings of the universities, which could not give a full account of their land ownership but own at least 1,800 hectares, according to information available online.The two major Cambridge landowners are St John’s and Trinity, which have 10,500 hectares worth £1.1bn and make up more than half of the 17,000 hectares owned by Cambridge colleges.Trinity values its property investments at £850m, and in early January, the college sold a block of retail and residential space in Kensington High Street, central London, to Unitum Ltd, a Malta-based holding company, for £28m.All Souls, Christ Church and Merton are Oxbridge’s biggest UK landowners, owning 14,000 of the 34,000 hectares held by Oxford colleges at a value of about £460m.The oldest property owned by any college is Buittle Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, built in the 12th century and given to the Scottish nobleman John de Balliol, who, with his wife, Lady Dervorguilla, founded Balliol College, Oxford, in 1263.Though the castle was captured by Robert the Bruce in the 14th century, it later reverted to the crown and is now back in the hands of Balliol College.One of the most lucrative holdings is the O2 arena, originally known as the Millennium Dome, which Trinity College owns on a 999-year lease after buying it for £24m in 2009.Trinity collects rent from Anschutz Entertainment Group, which operates the concert arena, and over the past two years, the college has registered a profit of nearly £22m from the site.Other well-known holdings include the site of the Top Gear test track, also owned by Trinity, and the Rose Bowl, the home of Hampshire cricket club, owned by Queen’s College, Oxford.One of the most unlikely holdings belongs to St John’s College, the alma mater of the former prime minister Tony Blair, and Oxford’s wealthiest college. It is the landlord of Millwall’s training ground. Less glamorous are swaths of rural farmland and woodland, which include an Isle of Wight farm bought by Queen’s College from Henry VIII, multiple Leeds industrial estates, several gastropubs across England, and the freeholds to more than 100 retail outlets and shops, including branches of Caffè Nero and HSBC.The most concentrated commercial land ownership is in Brent, where All Souls College, one of Oxford’s wealthiest, owns more than 300 properties. The vast majority are residential houses, but they also include the freehold of a Ladbrokes betting shop.The London borough had the highest proportion of housing benefit claims by private tenants in the country, according to research by the Financial Times in 2015.Several colleges have received agricultural subsidies amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, according to data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).These include £117,000 in common agricultural policy subsidies paid in 2016 to Waterside farm in Berkshire, owned by St John’s, which sits on wealth of £582m.The farm has received the taxpayer-funded grants, intended to conserve the environment by protecting wildlife and maintaining rural landscapes, despite West Berkshire council putting forward plans in 2016 to extract 200,000 tons of gravel over an 11-year period from the farm, located in the North Wessex Downs – an area of outstanding natural beauty.The plans were met with widespread anger at the time from locals, including one who wrote a letter to the college vowing to “highlight the damage that St John’s College is intent on inflicting on the environment, the ecosystem, the neighbourhood, the town, and not least, the residents”.Meanwhile, Cambridge, which holds net assets of £4.8bn, also received £180,000 in CAP subsidies in 2016 for its university farm. That is despite research from the university in 2015 describing such funding as “perverse” subsidies “promoting negative actions in both the long and short term by being bad for the environment and costly to the economy”.An Oxford spokesperson said: “The central university’s strong balance sheet allows us to fund new initiatives for our students, staff and outstanding teaching and research.”Oxford’s endowment includes 600 trusts with funds earmarked for specific purposes such as teaching posts, buildings and research. About £270m of the endowment supports student scholarships.Cambridge declined to reply to requests for a response.

So gloomy FBI agent Travolta steals Cage’s face. When Cage steals his face – and his wife and freedom – John Woo’s FaceOff becomes the biggest, wackiest, and most operatic summer blockbuster in history, a gonzo combustion that flings everything from pigeons to peaches at the screen. Hong Kong cineastes might applaud a script with roots in the ancient Sichuan opera genre Bian Lian, where performers swap masks like magic. Popcorn-munchers, of which I am front row center, are here to watch whackjob Cage and soulful Travolta, two actors who love to go full-ham, play each other and go deep inside their iconographies. Call it hamception. Or just call it a crazy swing that hits a homerun as Cavolta and Trage battling it out in a warehouse, a speedboat and, of course, a church. As Cage-as-Travolta gloats to Travolta-as-Cage, “Isn’t this religious? The eternal battle between good and evil, saint and sinners – but you’re still not having any fun!” Maybe he’s not, but we sure are. Bravo, bravo. ANThere’s been an increasing sense of desperation clinging to the majority of roles picked by Tom Cruise in recent years. Outside of the still shockingly entertaining Mission: Impossible series, he was miscast in the barely serviceable Jack Reacher and its maddeningly unnecessary sequel, his awards-aiming American Made was throwaway and his franchise-starting The Mummy was a franchise-killer. But four summers ago, he picked the right horse just maybe at the wrong time.Because despite how deliriously fun Edge of Tomorrow was in the summer of 2014, audiences didn’t show the requisite enthusiasm. It was a moderate success (enough to warrant a long-gestating sequel) but it should have packed them in, its combination of charm, invention and sheer thrills making it one of the most objectively successful blockbuster experiences in memory. The nifty plot device (Cruise must relive a day of dying while battling aliens over and over again) allowed for some dark gallows humor and a frenetic pace that kept us all giddily on edge while it also contained a dazzling action star turn from Emily Blunt whose fearless ‘Full Metal Bitch’ wrestled the film away from Cruise. Blame its relative failure on the bland title? Cruise fatigue? Blockbuster over-saturation? Then find a digital copy to watch and rewatch and repeat. BLBack to the Future very nearly wasn’t a summer blockbuster. The reshoots required after Eric Stoltz was booted off, then the fact Michael J Fox’s Family Ties commitments meant he could only shoot at night all meant filming didn’t wrap until late April. Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg duly pencilled in an August  September release.But then people started seeing it. Test scores were off the scale. Said producer Frank Marshall: “I’d never seen a preview like that. The audience went up to the ceiling”. So they bagsied the best spot the year had to offer – 3 July – hired a squad of sound editors to work round the clock and two print editors with instructions to get properly choppy. They did, and those big trims tightened yet further one of the tautest screenplays (by Bob Gale) cinema has ever seen. The only bit of fat they left was the Johnny B Goode scene: sure, it didn’t advance the story, but the kids at those test screenings knew we were gonna love it. Back to the Future is a pure shot of summer cinema: grand, ambitious, insanely entertaining. Deadpool, Avengers, take note: a blockbuster can be smart as hell so long as it wears it lightly. In the end, by the way, the film spent 11 weeks at number 1 at the US box office. That’s essentially the whole summer. CSThe first film I ever saw at the cinema was The Rocketeer. We drove into Bradford city centre, bought our tickets at the Odeon and sat through the 1991 tale which followed the fortunes of a stunt pilot, a rocket pack and a Nazi agent played by Timothy Dalton who sounded like he was from Bury rather than Berlin. The way into the multiplex there was a huge poster for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Arnie sat on a Harley with a shotgun cocked and ready. My dad was a huge fan of the original but he still couldn’t swing taking a seven-year-old to see it. It wasn’t until I borrowed a VHS copy that I finally got to see what was behind that image. Skynet, dipshits, T-1000s, a nuclear holocaust and a motorbike chases on the LA river.Blockbusters don’t usually have that edge: there’s a more brazen mainstream appeal. But Judgment Day was and still is an exception. It did huge numbers at the box office (more than $500m), was a rare sequel that was arguably better than the original and introduced really odd bits of Spanish idiom into the Bradford schoolyard lexicon. I probably would have been scarred for life watching it as a seven-year-old, but as a teenager it gave me a story I doubt I’ll ever get tired of revisiting. LBThe summer of 2008 was a busy one: Barack Obama emerged from a contentious democratic primary to become the first ever black presidential nominee of a major party. The dam fortifying the entire global financial system was about to burst. China hosted its first ever Summer Olympics. But somehow, and not exactly to my credit, what I remember most from that summer is the uncanny, ridiculously over-the-top publicity blitzkrieg that preceded the release of The Dark Knight, which has since emerged as not just an all-time great summer blockbuster, but an all-time great American film, period.There were faux-political billboards that read “I believe in Harvey Dent” a weirdly nondescript website of the same name Joker playing cards dispersed throughout comic book stores, which led fans to another website where the DA was defaced with clown makeup. Dentmobiles, Gotham City voter registration cards, a pop-up local news channel: the marketing campaign might have seemed excessive had the movie not so convincingly topped it. Ten years later, as films like Deadpool and Avengers: Infinity War try to reach those same heights of virality, The Dark Knight remains the measuring stick by which every superhero movie, and superhero villain, is measured. JNIn many ways, Fury Road is summer: arid, scorching, bright enough to be squinted at. The driving force behind all the high-impact driving is scarcity of water, the essence of life in a desert where death practically rises up from the burning sand. Even in the air-conditioned comfort of a multiplex auditorium in Washington DC’s Chinatown, watching George Miller’s psychotic motor opera left this critic sweaty and parched. “My world is fire and blood,” warns the weary Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) in the script’s opening lines. Staggering out of a theater into the oppressive rays of the sun, it sure can feel that way.Miller’s masterpiece fits into the summer blockbuster canon in a less literal capacity as well, striking its ideal balance of dazzling technical spectacle and massively-scaled emotional catharsis. There was plenty of breathless praise to go around upon this film’s 2015 release, much of it for the feats of practical-effects daring, but the hysterical extremes of feeling cemented its status as a modern classic. I can’t deny that I’ve watched the polecat sequence upwards of a dozen times, but Miller’s film truly comes alive in Furiosa’s howl of desperation, and in Max’s noble disappearance into the throng. CBIt’s the music, it’s the giant boulder, it’s the Old Testament mysticism, it’s the whip, it’s the Cairo Swordsman, it’s Harrison Ford’s crooked smile, it’s the bad dates, it’s Karen Allen drinking a sherpa under the table, it’s the melted faces and exploding heads. It’s all these things plus having the good fortune of seeing this at the cinema at a very young age, therefore watching most of it through my terrified fingers. (Indy tells Marion to keep her eyes shut during the cosmic spooky ending way ahead of you there!)The modern blockbuster as we know it was created by Steven Spielberg with Jaws and George Lucas with Star Wars, so the hype was unmatched when the two collaborated in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. As a kid I had no idea this was a loving homage to cliffhanger serials from the 30s and 40s, I took it as pure adventure. The seven-and-a-half minute desert truck chase (“I don’t know, I’m making thus up as I go”) is probably the best action sequence in all of cinema (John Woo’s Hard Boiled does not have a horse, sorry), but watching as an adult one notices a lot of sophisticated humor, too. (Indy being too exhausted to make love to Marion, for example, is something that didn’t connect when I was six.)It’s strange to think I watched these cartoon Nazis on VHS with my grandparents who had escaped the Holocaust, and no one benefits when you do the math to figure out how young Marion was when, as Indy puts it, “you knew what you were doing”. But for thrills, laughs and propulsive camerawork (though a little mild Orientalism), nothing tops this one. JHShort of actually calling their film Summer Blockbuster, rarely can a film’s height-of-summer release date been so central to a film’s raison d’etre. This being the mid-90s, when po-mo and self-referentiality was all the rage, brazenly hooking your tentpole film to July 4 was seen as a pretty smart idea. Fortunately, all the ducks did line up in a row for ID4: a game-changing performance from Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum at (arguably) his funniest, a rousingly Clintoneque president in Bill Pullman and – most importantly in that run-up to the millennium – physical destruction on a gigantic scale. Much comment at the time was expended on the laser obliteration of the White House (an early shot from the Tea PartyMaga crowd?), but I personally cherish director Roland Emmerich’s signature move of detonating cars in somersault formation. Like many other huge-budget films then and since, Independence Day was basically a tooled-up retread of cheap-as-chips format of earlier decades – though who these days would roll such expensive dice on what is essentially an original script, with no comic book or toy branding as a forerunner? We shall never see its like again. APAn Aliens summer is one for moviegoers who prefer to sit in in darkened rooms when the sun is shining the brutal confines of the fiery power plant make an excellent subliminal ad for air conditioning. In 1986, James Cameron took Ridley Scott’s elegant, iconic horror template and turned it into an all-out action blockbuster, forcing Ripley once again to face down her nemeses in a breathless fug of claustrophobia, sweat and fear. It’s relentlessly stressful and unbelievably thrilling.I first saw Aliens many years after its initial release. Owing to its sizeable and long-lasting legacy, it was at once immediately familiar, yet also brisk and brutally fresh. I understood that it was a classic, but I wasn’t prepared for just how good it is, for the pitch-perfect management of tension, the pace that never really lets up, the emotional pull. The maternal undertow of Ripley’s protection of Newt, and the alien mirror of that, adds a level of heart unusual in most blockbusters, and her frustration at being a woman whose authority must be earned again and again, and then proven again and again, remains grimly relevant, 30 years on. It’s also a total blast. Now get away from her, you bitch. RNIt is the great summer blockbuster ancestor – the film that in 1975 more or less invented the concept of the event movie. And unlike all those other summer blockbusters, Steven Spielberg’s Jaws is actually about the summer it is explicitly about the institution of the summer vacation, into which the movie was being sold as part of the seasonal entertainment. It is about the sun, the sand, the beach, the ocean and the entirely justified fear of being eaten alive by an enormous shark with the appetite of a serial killer and the cunning of a U-boat commander. And more than that: it is about that most contemporary of political phenomena: the coverup, the town authorities at a seaside resort putting vacationers at risk by not warning them about the shark. The “Jaws mayor” has become comic shorthand for the craven and pusillanimous politician.A blockbuster nowadays means spectacular digital effects, but this film is from an analogue world. It bust the block through brilliant film-making and an inspired score from John Williams, summoning up the shark with a simple two-note theme which became the most famous musical expression of evil since Bernard Herrmann’s shrieking violin stabs in Psycho took the place of actual knife-slashing. I still remember the excitement of the summer of 1975, and the queues around the block at the Empire, in Watford, round the corner from the football ground. The inspired brevity of the title meant the word was repeated over and over again to fill the marquee display: “JAWS – JAWS – JAWS” As if they were screaming it!

There was a champagne party bus home from the game in Bristol where the club won the title unbeaten, plus festivities that followed her scoring in her final match at Liverpool. Back in London, Aluko cooked paella for 20 friends at her home and David Luiz invited the squad to dine at his new Italian restaurant.“It had been an amazing week with women who have become good friends,” Aluko says. “Finishing this season in such a positive way wrapped up what started so negatively for me personally.”Between the revelry, there were plenty of tears as the 31-year-old considered reversing her decision. Aluko had grown frustrated at her bit-part role, concluding after five and a half years with Chelsea she would be more fulfilled elsewhere. She has signed with a club in Europe but won’t reveal where.“I’ve achieved pretty much everything I wanted to with Chelsea except maybe the Champions League, which I could still do somewhere else. I love to travel and sample new cultures the opportunity to play in Europe and learn a language is a big one. But there have been a lot of tears. I was crying on the pitch in Bristol. I have such a strong bond with the people I work with and questioned whether I’m ever going to experience that again with a new team, whether I’ll be that happy – the doubts start creeping in.”A forward with electrifying pace, Aluko has been one of the outstanding players in Britain for more than 15 years, since joining Birmingham City Ladies aged 15. Marcus Bignot, her coach at the time, called her the “Wayne Rooney of women’s football”.Her mum, Sileola, and dad, Daniel, a former MP in Nigeria, moved the family from Lagos to Birmingham when Aluko was six months old. She excelled at school and her parents encouraged her to continue her education even as it became apparent a top-flight football career was a possibility for her and her younger brother, Sone.Alongside playing she graduated with a first-class honours degree from Brunel University and worked as a lawyer. Aluko is adamant girls should not be forced to choose between a football career and academic studies, calling for clubs to offer the same opportunities as they do to their male counterparts.“My issue is young, talented players not having to compromise their education. If you look at the men’s academy setups, they have partnerships with colleges or universities, whereas we don’t really have that with women’s football. You don’t want an 18-year-old girl who’s very talented thinking: ‘I want to play for the first team but I’ve got to give up my education to do so.’ That has happened a lot in the past.“Some of big men’s clubs like Man City, Chelsea and Arsenal have raised the bar in terms of salaries and professionalism of the women’s game. I think there needs to be continued increase in salaries to reflect the attention on the game and its commercial viability. The argument before was that nobody was watching but that’s not true nowadays.”The idea that 45,000 fans would attend a women’s FA Cup final, as they did this month at Wembley, was scarcely believable when Aluko was cutting her teeth in the Midlands. She has noticed more girls coming up to her in the street or at games but what she finds most heartening is the sight of more young boys at Women’s Super League matches.“That’s the biggest change: young boys watching like they’re watching a men’s game, coming up and asking for my boots just as they would with Eden Hazard. That’s not only going to affect their perception of football it’s going to affect their perception of women, so when they grow up to have relationships they’re more likely to respect women as equals. They are seeing women in a very positive light and in a strong, competitive environment. Women’s sport has become normalised.”Aluko did not set out to become a champion of equality or a spokesperson on problems around discrimination. But she found herself on the front page and in parliament after accusing the former England women’s coach Mark Sampson of making racial comments to her and another player. She also alleged the Football Association had failed to investigate properly, as revealed by the .Privately Aluko was shunned by some of her former team-mates and was publicly accused of being a liar. An investigation by the barrister Katharine Newton ruled she had told the truth. Sampson later lost his job for an unrelated matter. But after a distinguished 11-year international career during which she won 102 caps, Aluko has been on the England sidelines for two years. Phil Neville has left the door open but she does not know if she will go back.“I spoke to him at a Chelsea game this season and it was a nice conversation. I congratulated him on his appointment and we talked about him moving back from Spain and I’m sure he’s seen a few games where I’ve played this season.“But I’ve moved on from what was a very stressful, negative period in my life. I’ve dealt with it in the best way I could. Standing up for what you believe in and being honest, telling the truth are all very liberating things. Since that time I’ve felt very empowered by other people seeing you can stand for what you believe, even in adversity. Success is always the best answer to critics. When you look at some of the greatest people and players in the world they all stand for something outside their working lives.”Aluko will be in Russia working as a pundit on ITV’s World Cup coverage. In 2014 she made history as the first female pundit on Match of the Day and believes she has opened the door for other women players to make a move into broadcasting, although she concedes there is still a way to travel for equality.“To be going to Russia to work on a men’s World Cup is incredible. I never thought that would happen and it shows a shift in broadcasting where women are becoming accepted just as part of the team. I think the difference is that if women fail, the consequences are greater.“There’s a tendency for some male pundits who have done it for years to rock up and take it for granted. I can’t afford to do that so that’s why I have to geek out on all the stats and facts and make sure I am not seen as a token woman but that I’m adding to the conversation.”As with all areas of her life and playing career, Aluko will ensure she is well prepared for any eventuality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed468d77c6f301c2b7dee29045675aa4298c4a94/1463_105_3106_1864/master/3106.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=726e3a16be0b69d00ef18de99bdc0921","title":"anton miranchuk russias twin who emerged from the shadows","story":"The playmaker spent his early career behind his twin in the pecking order but the two of them are now Russia’s key creatorsThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.There was understandable cause for celebration when Alexey Miranchuk, who had come on as a substitute, scored the third goal to wrap up Lokomotiv Moscow’s Russian Cup final win over Kuban Krasnodar in May 2015. After full-time the club’s president, Olga Smorodskaya, swiftly came down to the dressing room and made sure to congratulate the talented forward – only to get it all wrong.She had actually hailed Miranchuk’s identical twin brother, Anton, and although the misunderstanding was innocent it struck a raw nerve. Anton had barely been involved in the first team and had effectively been forgotten while Alexey shot to the top. In that context, the turnaround that has ensued is remarkable: now the brothers carry Russia’s World Cup hopes together after their paths finally converged in a season that brought hero status with Lokomotiv Moscow. Miracles are expected from both– a situation that looked inconceivable only 12 months ago.For years, everything had been about Alexey. He was the golden boy: a debutant for Lokomotiv at the age of 17 who won the faith of their then-manager Slaven Bilic and went on to become a fixture in the side. Alexey quickly made a splash on the international scene too. In June 2015, when he was only 19, he made his bow for Russia against Belarus and scored 12 minutes after coming on. Soon afterwards he would be named in a “Backed by Messi” team of 10 promising players from around the world selected by Adidas and the Barcelona forward. He received a special pair of boots for the privilege he has hardly looked back since and the upshot, in short, is that Alexey is already a fully-formed star.While his twin thrived, Anton fared altogether differently. At first the brothers’ careers developed in parallel. At the age of 15 they moved together from their home city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban, near Krasnodar, to the capital. That was actually at Spartak Moscow’s invitation, but before long their academy coaches decided the brothers were too short and physically weak. A greater show of belief came from Lokomotiv, who took them in and put them up in a boarding school. Their mother Yelena, a teacher, was given a job at the school too and the pair say that was vital for their wellbeing. “Things might have gone differently without her keeping an eye on us,” Alexey said last year.As it was, their fortunes soon began to contrast. While Bilic put Alexey in his starting lineup, Anton trained, trained and trained, seeing coaches come and go – but did not get a sniff, save for a two-minute appearance against Rotor Volgograd in the cup. Injuries did not help and certainly contributed to his apparent invisibility. That encounter with Smorodskaya was a low point but Anton looked close to dropping off the football map entirely when, in early 2016, he was loaned to the Estonian side Levadia Tallinn.“People don’t come back from there,” critics said – but they could hardly have been more wrong. The trip helped Anton grow up: he cooked food for himself, did his own washing and attained a degree of independence that had not come easily at his parent club. Things did not get off to a straightforward start – in his first match for Levadia he both scored and was sent off – but he soon became the team’s key player. Over his year in Estonia, Miranchuk played 40 games, scored 15 times and made 11 assists.In August 2016, Lokomotiv reappointed the legendary coach Yuri Semin and everything transformed. Semin believed in Anton to the extent that, before the end of the 2016-17 season, he gave him a first Russian Premier League appearance with each game after that Anton grew visibly stronger, his performances as a central attacking midfielder getting better and better. When the new campaign began, Semin handed him a starting role.That show of trust was rewarded with some marvellous performances for Lokomotiv, who won their first league title in 14 years. Now starring alongside his brother on a weekly basis, Anton became impossible for the Russia head coach, Stanislav Cherchesov, to ignore and was selected for the squad that faced Argentina and Spain. In a thrilling 3-3 draw with Spain he made more successful dribbles than anyone else in the Russia team and played a part in the third goal.His impressive start at international level means Russia’s recent tradition of twins continues. The Berezutsky brothers, Vasily and Alexei, were defensive lynchpins for many years and won 159 caps between them. They gave way to younger talent after 2016 and, although playing in a completely different area of the pitch, the Miranchuks fit that definition perfectly. Along with Igor Akinfeev, Aleksandr Golovin and Fyodor Smolov, they are arguably the players who supporters hope can make their home tournament extra special. It has been some journey here but, having gone from outcast to assist-making king, Anton Miranchuk’s talent now stands out to everybody.Philipp Papenkov writes for Sport-Express.

Now you can do the same with our interactive toolIn goal it has to be Jorge Campos. Like me, he played in three World Cups and also played in over 100 games for the Mexico national team. In my opinion, he was the best goalkeeper that Mexico has ever had.My first centre-back is Rafael Márquez because of what he has done in Europe with Barcelona, where he won four league titles and two European Cups. He has played over 140 games for the national team too – and he could feature in a fifth World Cup! Carlos Salcido was an extremely efficient centre-back and was so effective in over 120 appearances so he earns a place in my team. At right-back I would have the versatile Pável Pardo – he’s right behind me when it comes to the most caps for the national team – and to complete my defence I will pick Ramón Ramírez at left-back. He has done such important things with Mexico. He’s gone to World Cups, Gold Cups and won the 1999 Confederations Cup. He was one of the very best.My first midfielder is Andrés Guardado, for his consistency while playing in various World Cups and because he has already won over 140 caps with the national team at the age of 31. He’s always there when Mexico need him. Gerardo Torrado is one of my three midfielders. Over the years he has been a significant and influential ball-winning player. Alberto García Aspe is my other midfielder. Like Torrado, Aspe was also very consistent and another Mr Reliable for Mexico.Cuauhtémoc Blanco is my pick just behind the front two. For me, he is the most talented player that Mexico has ever had. He always gave everything for the national team, everything! He’s one of Mexico’s all-time great goalscorers.Javier Hernández is one of my centre-forwards. Chicharito continues to be a supremely able footballer and nowadays he is the player we look to in the national team to score the goals. A natural goalscorer and they are quite rare. The final player in my all-time XI is Hugo Sánchez. What a player. He played at such a high level for so many years and became a towering figure in Mexico for what he accomplished in Europe with Atlético Madrid and then Real Madrid, where his goals helped fire the team to five league titles. Incredible.

Yet while his wife, Rebeca Tavares, could barely contain her excitement as she filmed their flight on a private jet from Madrid to Merseyside on Monday in a video that was later posted on Instagram, Fabinho managed to keep his cool as he responded to her impromptu interview.“We’re landing in Liverpool in a few minutes. How do you feel?” he was asked. “What?” came the response. “How do you feel about Liverpool?” pressed his wife. “I feel good. Thanks.”Monaco supporters will be used to such understatement from a player who prefers to do his talking on the pitch. Ever since Fabinho arrived in the principality as a fresh-faced 19-year-old, his conduct and attitude have been exemplary. Initially signed on a year-long loan from the Portuguese club Rio Ave having spent a season in Real Madrid’s Castilla side, he became a regular at right-back under Claudio Ranieri in Monaco’s first season back in Ligue 1 and was retained for another year when Leonardo Jardim took over as manager the following year.But it was Jardim’s decision to switch Fabinho to a central midfield role in his third season at the club that transformed both his and Monaco’s fortunes. Having signed a permanent deal with the club that summer, the Portuguese immediately installed the 6ft 2in Brazilian at the heart of his exciting young team and reaped the rewards.Securing the Ligue 1 title ahead of Paris Saint-Germain’s expensively -assembled squad in 2016-17 and reaching the semi-finals of the Champions League during the same season was the culmination of that journey. Yet while Kylian Mbappé, Bernardo Silva, Tiémoué Bakayoko and Benjamin Mendy were all allowed to move on at the end of the campaign, it was telling that Fabinho was ordered to remain despite an informal agreement with his representatives, Jorge Mendes and the former Portugal midfielder Deco.The result was a mediocre start to the season that may have ultimately cost him a place in Brazil’s World Cup squad, although the player who left Fluminense having never featured for the first team has since underlined his undoubted ability as Monaco secured Champions League qualification for a fourth successive year.Manchester United initially appeared to be the most likely destination for Fabinho once Monaco decided to allow the 24-year-old to finally depart but despite holding talks last summer, and José Mourinho sharing the same agent, an offer did not materialise. In fact Atlético Madrid were the only club to have made a firm bid of around £30m until Liverpool’s offer blew them out of the water.Liverpool’s relationship with Mendes, who arranged Fabinho’s move to Rio Ave in 2013, proved pivotal in the club’s latest intelligent move in the transfer market. Having already secured their record purchase of Naby Keïta from RB Leipzig last summer, the two new recruits will report at Melwood on 1 July as part of a squad that already looks considerably stronger than the party which lost to Real Madrid in the Champions League final.“I always said that this was a league that I wanted to get to know, where I wanted to play. You see lots of passion, crazy atmospheres in all the stadiums each weekend. I cannot wait to experience that.”Fabinho could soon be joined by Nabil Fekir, with Liverpool understood to be in advanced discussions to sign the France forward from Lyon for around £60m. Even with the heartache of Saturday night in Kiev still fresh in the memory, Liverpool supporters will be already counting down the days to the start of next season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a68596b08817fba8da8d025e369067c6083591/0_178_3300_1979/master/3300.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b6e8972f42725f480dea9145532cc95","title":"its only a beer the unwritten contracts between men and women","story":"‘It’s a contract only a man can create, and sometimes it feels like only a man can break it. Women are expected to sign on the dotted line’The first time I failed to pay up, I was a high school student at a bowling alley in my small town in central Pennsylvania. An older man bought me a beer and talked to me while he shot pool. Smoking and drinking in that grungy bowling-alley bar in the seediest part of town, I felt cosmopolitan and mature. I was oblivious to the transaction taking place: by drinking his beer, I was entering into an implicit and unwritten contract in which I was expected to fulfill a sexual obligation. One of my more astute and experienced friends told the man that I had a boyfriend and had no intention of being intimate with him. He became irate and threw a lit cigarette into my hair as I left the bar. I went home scared and confused as to why my acceptance of a beer and friendly conversation had gotten me into a terrifying mess.What I learned that day is that attention from unfamiliar men is implicitly transactional, and a failure to pay the price can result in some traumatic consequence. I admit that on this point, I have been proven wrong repeatedly over time. But I have also had enough disturbing experiences that every male stranger is suspect. It’s always possible that I am going to be expected to acknowledge a tacit, unwritten contract and obey its terms and conditions. It’s a contract only a man can create, and sometimes it feels like only a man can break it. Women are expected to sign on the dotted line.In my early twenties, while in Galway, Ireland, I accepted a drink from an older man in a bar the night before I was to board a ferry for more remote islands off the Irish coast. I wouldn’t be in another city for a while and was craving human voices and activity. I declined the offer of a drink and company at first, aware that I might regret accepting. But after his second offer and his insistence that it was “only a beer”, I decided that I could use some conversation. I was up front about having no intention of sleeping with this man, and I offered to pay for a round of beers. I asked him questions about things that piqued my curiosity: his opinions on Irish politics, the economy and the European Union. I thought that by being direct, I could evade the contract, or that my company alone had value since we were two solitary souls away from home on a rainy night. But after a short while he became increasingly insistent and my rejections became harsher, until we were directly debating whether I would sleep with him. I left the bar in a disappointed huff, only to have him follow me out.I ran away from him up the tangled Galway cobblestone streets as he yelled obscenities.Last week at a concert, a woman friend told me that during the course of her day, she is most terrified during the brief period when she gets to the door of her house but doesn’t yet have her keys prepared to unlock the door and is momentarily vulnerable on the doorstep. When I hugged her goodbye, she slipped mace into my hand and offered to drive me to my car only two blocks away.Another told me of a man who walked behind her into her downtown apartment building when she had been out late. He followed her into her apartment and sat on her couch while she nervously repeated that she would be expecting her boyfriend any minute and he needed to leave.Or the countless friends who have shared stories of dates they’ve been on where the men pushed against asserted boundaries and assaulted them, even after they had said no. The de facto existence of violence is acknowledged between women and has likely always been acknowledged by women in the private sphere. Our shared accounts allow us to relate to one another. They turn statistics into flesh and bone, and form the basis for a mutual understanding that something isn’t right. The vocalization of pain and fear is cathartic. As I’ve written this essay and taken opportunities to share my interest in this topic with other women, I’ve found that the conversation almost always leads to swapping stories of threatening encounters, of validating each other’s fears and sharing our coping mechanisms.My conversations happened during the #MeToo movement, which even a troglodyte like me was exposed to on social media feeds. The use of the phrase “Me Too” to vocalize solidarity with assault survivors was started in 2006 by Tarana Burke, an African American woman and civil rights activist. Many brave people posted stories on media websites about their experiences of sexual harassment and violence in and out of the workplace. This accumulation of stories proved to be powerful, and the current hashtag movement sparked an unprecedented wave of accusations against men who’ve used their positions of power in Hollywood and other highly visible industries to abuse the women who were subordinate to them. This year, many women and gender-nonconforming people participated in the #MeToo movement, but my own response was very different. I felt deeply uncomfortable and disquieted as the movement’s popularity and exposure grew. Despite my identity as a staunch feminist and my education, which allows me to contextualize my experiences as a woman, I was reluctant to participate. To share my stories would be to relinquish control over them and to expose the inner life that I have constructed. Sharing invites pushback that could invalidate my story and perhaps even lead to violence. Sharing invites conversations with my parents and former partners that I am not prepared to have. Sharing is discouraged thanks to the same mechanisms that force me to be polite to men, even the ones I wish would leave me alone. If I name the violence, then it follows that I am a victim of it, and therefore lack agency.How did we get to the point where the sharing of women’s everyday experiences is a national news story? How did women become socialized into silence in the first place? How does a hashtag improve conditions for poor Appalachian teenagers smoking cigarettes in shady small-town bars?As a budding academic, I presented my research in my field – geography – at a large conference when I was still an undergraduate. With my sights set on graduate school, I was glad for the opportunity to learn and network. I met many other academics and talked about my interest in doctoral programs and continuing research. One night during the conference, a fellow student, a young woman, told me that older men at the conference had been hitting on her all day by feigning interest in her work and then giving her their contact information. The stack of business cards on my hotel room nightstand assumed a more sinister aura, and I flipped through them thereafter with suspicion. The cards reflected the current data from the National Center for Education Statistics about gender equity in academic institutions, with the most influential full-time faculty positions awarded to white males, and women working a higher proportion of the part-time adjunct positions. How could I ever be sure that any of the men who had offered to help me were interested in my research or career? What if, instead, my naive gullibility had landed me with a list of numbers from older men trying to sleep with me, rather than legitimate professional opportunities? What if I met with one of them and the encounter turned confrontational?I never contacted any of the men I met at that conference or any other, thereby reinforcing and reproducing the relations of power within the academy.Although I crave platonic and professional relationships and interactions with men, the process of creating these relationships feels dangerous. When a man I don’t know speaks to me in public, I am both intrigued and distressed by the potential outcomes, which range from overt violence to friendship and compassion. I want to dissolve the boundaries of gender socialization that keep us all isolated and that ensure I will never know the struggles of the masculine nor they the feminine. But the threat of latent violence makes me turn my head, pretend I didn’t hear, resisting the possibility of engagement and almost always saying no. On a spring day when I was twenty-four and in graduate school at Portland State University, I stopped on my way home to get a beer and french fries, and to read for class at an outside picnic table. As I was waiting for my fries, a man two tables in front of me asked me if I wanted to join him. I declined, thinking of the previous experiences I’d had when accepting beers from men in bars.A few minutes later, he asked again, in a humble sort of way. His casual tone was tempting, and I hesitantly agreed.I joined him at his table. He was friendly and interesting, an eye doctor from the South who had fallen on hard times after his medical practice went under and he lost his home, his car, his savings. But on that day he had been offered his first job in years and was looking for someone to celebrate with. We talked for hours, even moving inside when it started to rain, comparing our experiences in graduate versus medical school, talking about money and moving to Portland from the East Coast.When I finally got up to leave, he didn’t ask for my number.

Arriving at our friends’ house, we found that it, too, was a single room deep and extremely long. “Did this style of house have a name?” I asked over a cup of tea and the best slice of jam-and-buttercream-filled Victoria sponge I’ve eaten since my granny passed away (recipe requested: it is from Annie Rigg). “Welsh long houses” was the satisfying reply, at which a book by Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate was put on the table.House plans are the next best thing to having a nose-around and, even in a teatime chat about Welsh architecture, it is hard not to slip into potential buyer mode looking at them – assessing size, light and the best bedroom. Peate’s book – decades of work documenting this important part of Welsh history – is full of plans illustrating these houses, often with a stall for animals at one end (possibly a dairy) and the human living quarters at the other. As in life, my eyes end up on the kitchen, at the heart of which is always a large fireplace or hearth. In Welsh, the word for hearth is aelywyd, in Latin focus, which comes from the Italian fuoco (fire), the same root as the English word “focus”. Before ovens, bread was cooked on the hearth, the dough laid on the stone, maybe covered with hot ashes, and baked. In Italy, hearth bread was called panis foculis, which is the origin of the word “focaccia”, a yeasted dough cooked quickly.Over time, focaccia has taken on different forms and, depending on where you are in Italy, it now means different things. In Liguria, it is about 2cm high with childlike dimples, glistening with olive oil and crystals of salt. Focaccia Pugliese is much deeper, often with tomatoes pressed into the cushion-like dough, which then bake into it like deeply set red buttons. Hearth breads are also the ancestors of pizza the difference – usually – is that pizza has less yeast, which makes it flatter. But this is not the case in Rome: the pizza bianca of my local bakery is plumper than the flaky, cracker-like focaccia of a nearby pizzeria. Not that I am fussing about size or semantics – I am happy when either is brought to me hot from the oven, glistening with olive oil and strewn with salt that clings to lips and fingers.For me, focaccia is inextricably linked to my teacher Carla Tomasi, because when she gives a lesson or makes you lunch, there is inevitably one baking in the oven when you arrive – a warm, yeasty welcome that seems to sum her up.Her recipe makes a focaccia that is just the right point between tender and chewy. It calls for 200g ‘00’ flour, 200g strong bread flour, a teaspoon of fast-action dry yeast, a teaspoon of fine salt, a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil and 300ml of tepid water mixed into a soft, slightly sticky and shaggy ball in a bowl, which is covered and left to rest for at least 15 minutes. You then turn the dough on to an oiled worktop and knead it gently for a few minutes before returning to the oiled bowl for an hour. By now, the dough should be as soft and pliable as warm putty, and ready to be pressed into a large bread tin – or two smaller ones. Then it is left to rest for another hour, before being given deep dimples with oily fingers and baked at 190C375Fgas 5 for 25 minutes, or until puffed up and the colour of a polished cymbal. To finish, brush with more olive oil and sprinkle with salt and chopped rosemary, then serve while still warm. True, this all demands time, but not from the cook, as most of it is resting, which – because we know – is when good things happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9d2bf7edb2942d60d194777ce5b32ccead8e5/0_44_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db58ba5270d4fb116e1c83238c16b12","title":"off the wall pin up posters from glam to new wave","story":"From David Bowie to X-Ray Spex, Richard Hell to Suzi Quatro, a new book collates some of the best posters of the 1970s and 80s to be tacked up in teenage bedrooms everywhere"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7f5786b88957f735425a27b6064fa3d73ee1755/0_0_3486_2400/master/3486.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6063e1d9537bf8a00568bccec2ef21e 700w","title":"cricket natural choice world leader climate change","story":"The sport has an bond with the land that few other field sports do and Thursday’s game at Lord’s can put the environment centre stageIn September 2017 Roosevelt Skerrit, the prime minister of Dominica, stood up in front of the UN general assembly. “Eden is broken,” he said.Skerrit had travelled to New York from his devastated island nation, battered to bare-root nakedness by Hurricane Maria, which spat out homes and lives, leaving behind flooding, landslides and a crumpled infrastructure. The category five storm splintered the island’s ancient forests, a Unesco world heritage site, ripping away the lush canopy to reveal a broken, brown reality.The storm also razed the island’s Windsor Park cricket stadium – and on Thursday a Rest of the World team take on the West Indies at Lord’s to raise money for its restoration, and that of James Ronald Webster Park in Anguilla, ruined by hurricane Irma just two weeks earlier.The game is a shining example of cricket acting for the common good. It will raise much-needed funds and the tickets, which are £10 for children, are reasonable. The game is being held during the half-term holiday and will be shown on Sky. It brings together players from around the globe including Rashid Khan, Shahid Afridi, Thisara Perera, Dinesh Karthik, and Mitchell McClenaghan under the captaincy of Eoin Morgan for the Rest of the World.But there is something missing. There has been no discussion of the reasons why the weather seems to be changing, what might be done to prevent it or why the hurricane season of 2017 was both so unprecedented and so brutal.No one weather event can be categorically labelled as “caused by climate change”. But scientists are confident that climate change is bringing more extreme weather events, and that it increases the severity of hurricanes, like Irma and Maria, as greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere driving more powerful winds. Rising temperatures have led to higher sea levels, which in turn means bigger storm surges. Higher water temperatures lead to more evaporation of water into the air, and that means more rain and therefore a higher risk of flooding.Skerrit is in no doubt what is to blame for his island’s repeated battering. In April he spoke of the country’s plans to become the world’s first climate resilient nation. But, he asked, what of the rest of the planet?“In the current system, those who reap the financial benefits from the emissions of greenhouse gasses are not those who carry the costs. As a result, there is an underinvestment in limiting climate change, mitigating its costs and reducing climate-related damage. That is no longer a viable situation. The time for talk, conventions and declarations is over. The time for action is now,” said Skerrit.So what does cricket do? There is for the game both a responsibility and an opportunity in tackling climate change. Cricket, and its followers, have an emotional and physical bond with the land in a way that few other field sports do. From the dustbowls of Ahmedabad to the lush pastures of the Somerset levels, cricket is its environment. It affects the batting conditions, the way the ball moves, the choice of players on the field, the way the game is played.A roll-call of incidents from the the last few years suggest the scale of future challenges the game will have to face, and the risks of doing nothing. Last October Irma and Maria hit the Caribbean this February the Western Province Cricket Association cancelled all club and school cricket because of severe drought in Cape Town and the surrounding areas. In 2016, 13 IPL games were moved from Maharashtra as parts of the state endured their worst drought for 100 years, and the control of water became a legal issue this April when the Mumbai high court forbade the Maharashtra Cricket Association from receiving water from the Pavana dam for its matches in Pune. Last December, air pollution in Delhi during the India v Sri Lanka Test resulted in players vomiting on the pitch and wearing face masks. Play was repeatedly held up and oxygen cylinders were brought into the dressing rooms. In England, 10 county grounds sit in cities where pollution levels exceed WHO recommendations. In the last month, a heatwave in Karachi has killed at least 65 people. And earlier this year, a report by the Climate Coalition named cricket as the game in the UK most likely to be affected by climate change. “There is clear evidence that climate change has had a huge impact on the game,” said Dan Musson, the ECB’s national participation manager, “in the form of general wet weather and extreme weather events.”Glamorgan, the sole Welsh voice in county cricket, have lost 1,300 overs of cricket since 2000 because of the weather. Their head of operations, Dan Cherry, is frank.“Losing so much cricket is a county’s worst nightmare – it affects the club at every level,” he has said. “It’s difficult even for first-class counties to be commercially viable with such an impact.”Steve Birks, the Trent Bridge groundsman, told the Cricket Paper only this month: “The rain is getting tropical, it is getting heavier. We’re getting thunderstorms more often when it rains – I think that’s when you can tell the difference.”Cricket must adapt to what the World Bank calls “the new climate normal” but it must also become part of the solution. On the day of the IPL final, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) signed an agreement to promote green cricket, “greening operations and engaging cricketers and fans in green initiatives”. The following months will give us an idea of how much the BCCI really cares, and how much is greenwash.Becoming a world leader, a shining example of good environmental practice would attract to cricket the much-desired growth audience – as well as being the right thing to do. Young people, in particular, care about the future of the planet in a way they might not care about, say, 100-ball cricket. Increasingly sponsors too are likely to look at environmental performance when calculating where to put their money.So many things could be done quite easily – large and small – from carbon audits to sensible tour planning to reduce the number of flights, from encouraging spectators to travel to matches in sustainable ways to curbing single-use plastic use. Some grounds, Lord’s and the Oval particularly, but also Edgbaston and Cardiff, are acting unilaterally, but cricket, and sport in general, is crying out for environmental leadership – how fabulous it would be if Thursday’s match banged heads together. With 2.5bn fans worldwide, cricket has the potential to influence human behaviour in profound ways.• This is an extract taken from The Spin, the ’s weekly cricket email.

After exactly two hours, she heads into the final exchanges – surviving a late fright from Kuznetsova late on – to bag a 7-6, 6-2 win. Good stuff, she signs a few autographs and heads off court, well aware she wasn’t at her best. On Court 7 Fabio Fognini has just got under way against Andujar. Muguruza eventually makes it 4-1 after a little spot of bother at deuce. Kuznetsova is not going out without a fight, though. Elsewhere in the first round of the men’s singles, Cilic is trailing in the third set against Duckworth, while big-serving John Isner is looking pretty good against Rubin. He’s 3-2 up in the third set after taking the first two. Garbine Muguruza looks pretty comfortable out there, she’s just gone 3-1 up in the second and it is one helluva mountain to climb now for Kuznetsova. The Spaniard is ripping through the games now heading towards a straight sets win. Time for me to grab some lunch. Ben Fisher will be your guide for a bit. Put your hands together for Ben!On Court 3, Australia’s Sam Stosur takes the first set 6-2 against Belgium’s Yanina Wickmayer. As for Denis Shapovalov, he’s closing in on victory over John Millman after breaking in the third set.On Suzanne-Lenglen, Denis Shapovalov is in total control. Having overcome an early wobble, the young Canadian leads 7-5, 6-4 against John Millman.Fiona Ferro has got the locals on their feet on Court 18. The unfancied world No257 has beaten Germany’s Carina Witthoeft 6-4, 6-2 to make the second round of her home slam for the first time. What a result. Ferro, who’s not bad on clay, will face either Muguruza or Kuznetsova next.An utterly dominant tie-break from Garbine Muguruza earns her the first set over Svetlana Kunznetsova. Muguruza took it 7-3 and it’s difficult to say she doesn’t deserve to be ahead. She’s had the upper hand throughout.Let’s head around the outside courts, where there’s no shortage of action. On Court 9, Germany’s Maximilian Marterer leads 6-1, 6-3 against the USA’s Ryan Harrison, whose compatriot, Tennys Sandgren, is two sets down to Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz on Court 15. On Court 12, Jan-Lennard Struff is two sets and a break up against Russia’s Evgeny Donskoy. On Court 8,A hold apiece at the end of the first set and Murguruza and Kuznetsova head into a tie-break. Meanwhile Marin Cilic has got there in the end, holding his nerve to take a 6-3, 7-5 lead over James Duckworth.On Philippe-Chatrier, Marin Cilic serves for a two-set lead. Really badly. James Duckworth breaks back for 5-5 in the second.Play! Over on Court 1, they’ve reached the business end of the first set. Garbine Muguruza will feel she should have won it already, given that she served for it, but Svetlana Kuznetsova has kept battling and has forced it to 5-5, which is where we resume.Players have returned to courts. We’ll have tennis in a few minutes. Hang on! I am a liar! Just as I sent that post, footage emerged of the covers coming off! Play should resume soon.I wish I could bring you better news about the weather. But I’m not a liar.We are currently being treated to a replay of yesterday’s action. The rain continues to fall.Play is still happening on other courts. How strange. On Court 7, Kevin Anderson is two sets up against Italy’s Paolo Lorenzi, while Sorana Cirstea is a set up against Daria Gavrilova on Court 6.Garbine Muguruza looks displeased. Can you blame her? She’s just blown a chance to claim the first set, allowing Kuznetsova to break back for 5-5.Denis Shapovalov was a break down early in the first set. But the young Canadian is in charge now. He’s taken it 7-5 against John Millman. Parity didn’t last long on Court 1. Booming groundstrokes from Garbine Muguruza are too much for Svetlana Kuznetsova to handle and the Spaniard breaks to lead 4-3 in the first set.Fiona Ferro, an unseeded Frenchwoman, is having fun on Court 18. She’s braved the rain to take the first set 6-4 against Germany’s Carina Witthoeft.Kuznetsova rips a backhand down the line to earn two break points. Muguruza saves the first but then comes an error. They’re on serve again in the first set. As they are on Suzanne-Lenglen, where Denis Shapovalov is fighting back against John Millman. It’s 5-5 in the first. Millman’s serving.The first set of the day is done and it’s gone to Marin Cilic, who’s in a hurry against James Duckworth. The Croatian takes it 6-3.They’re back on court. For the time being at least.“We’ll hope for the best,” says the umpire on Court 1. They’re waiting to see if the rain passes but apparently a big storm’s on the way.The players have returned to their seats. It’s too wet to play at the moment. They’re still going on Philippe-Chatrier, though, with Marin Cilic 4-2 up against James Duckworth.Umbrellas are up at Roland Garros. Svetlana Kuznetsova is having a chat with the umpire. She’d prefer play to stop. Not yet, though. On we go for now.To Suzanne-Lenglen, where Denis Shapovalov is in action. The young Candian, seeded 24th here, caused quite the stir at the US Open last year and he is one of those who could make an impact at this tournament. But not if he doesn’t liven up this morning. He’s a break down early on against John Millman, the Australian scrapper. It was a good day for the Brits yesterday, with Cameron Norrie and Heather Watson both winning. Kyle Edmund will be hoping to keep the good vibes flowing later.Maybe Muguruza won’t have her hands that full. She’s broken Kuznetsova in the first game. Elsewhere Marin Cilic is flying on Philippe-Chatrier - the Croatian leads 3-0 against James Duckworth.There are grey skies in Paris and the courts are rather empty. But we have tennis. And on Court 1, we have an intriguing encounter. Garbine Muguruza, who won this tournament in 2016 and Wimbledon last year, is so strong on her day. But she can be erratic as well and she’s likely to have her hands full today. Her opponent is Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2009 champion. The Russian veteran’s unseeded but dangerous.Hello. A first-round match featuring the world No451 wouldn’t normally be expected to take place on the biggest court at Roland Garros. But this world No451 is no ordinary world No451. This world No451 is Serena Williams, who’s playing in her first grand slam match since giving birth to her first child. The woman regarded by many as the greatest ever to play the sport, give or take a Martina or a Steffi, is third on Philippe-Chatrier with Krystina Pliskova of the Czech Republic and it will be fascinating to see how she fares. Not many people expect Williams to win her 24th slam. She has looked unsurprisingly rusty since returning to the tour a few months ago but the fact she’s here is inspiration in itself, bearing in mind the health complications she faced after bringing her daughter Olympia into the world. Mind you, we are talking about someone who won the Australian Open while she was pregnant. Even without a seeding, Serena Williams is not to be underestimated.Before she takes to the court, though, there are a couple of other matches to get out of the way first. Marin Cilic, the No3 seed and former US Open champion, opens his tournament against Australia’s James Duckworth, and then Rafael Nadal and Simone Bolelli resume their rain-interrupted bout from last night. Nadal is two sets up but Bolelli was 3-0 up in the third before the rain arrived. Can the Italian force a fourth? Or will Nadal come roaring out of the traps?The latter seems more likely, you know, and that might allow us to focus on events elsewhere. We won’t be short of entertainment today. Simona Halep, world No1, is in action against America’s Alison Riske later, Maria Sharapova faces Richel Hogenkamp of the Netherlands, Juan Martin del Potro meets Nicolas Mahut and 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza meets 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. Oh, and Kyle Edmund, the British No1 and 16th seed, faces rising Aussie whizzkid Alex De Minaur. They’re up second on Court 3. As long as the rain doesn’t get in the way.Play begins at: 10am BST and 11am in Paris."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de3d15e3c8f4774f30da367e0f4bb78a9c62167/0_125_2202_1322/master/2202.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04c27596ca7abccf36b0f4ab7db2e520","title":"cuba gooding jr webchat star chicago","story":"The Oscar-winning star, now strutting the West End stage in Chicago, is here to answer your questions Was the making of As Good As It Gets as much fun as I suspect it was.

Any anecdotes about acting alongside Jack?Yes. Millions of them. We filmed on the Sony Studios lot and he told me a story of being a film runner on the back of a bicycle taking the stock from the sound stage to the editing room when he was 17. I couldn\u0027t believe that.What was your favourite meal before fame and wealth arrived?Taco Bell. And it still is. Crunchy tacos.Who from the Boyz N the Hood cast are you still in touch with?I just wrapped a movie for Will Smith\u0027s production company called Life in a Year co-starring Nia Long who played my girlfriend in Boyz N the Hood.At the time of filming were you aware of the cultural impact Boyz N the Hood would go on to have? The scene with the police officers’ stop and search really stuck with me. Powerful stuff.Yes. There were gunshots in the distance and fist fights on the set. The extras lived the life that we were portraying in the movie.What’s your favourite biscuit (cookie)?I grew up watching your brother Omar in tv classics like Hanging with Mr Cooper and Smart Guy. Was there ever any sibling rivalry between you two? Also, do you think it’s time for a sequel or reboot of Hanging with Mr Cooper?No rivalry! I\u0027m nine years older than him so when I became famous he was just starting out and I wanted the best for him. And I still do!One of my favourite ever shows from the US was the magnificent Hill Street Blues, what was it like as an up-and-coming actor to get a part in one of the episodes?I was discovered in a high school play by an agent and she said she\u0027d represent me. That got me my SAG card and started my career. RIP Steven Bochco and thank you for starting my career.What moment in your life has had a profound effect in a way you least anticipated?I had a meeting with my high school councillor for college submissions. She said to me if you don\u0027t take your SATs this weekend there is no college for you. And I realised that college had no place in my plans for my life.

The kids love the fact I bit his ear.SpaceGonk asks:Which gives you more satisfaction – film or theatre?Film work is spontaneous therefore it gives you the opportunity to indulge in fresh creativity. Theatre is the act of rediscovery every day because you\u0027re dealing with the same material.AlexHD asks:Do you remember your first visit to the theatre? No! I remember seeing Cabaret several times over the course of one month. But my first time? No.I loved The People Vs OJ – was there any trepidation over taking on such a notorious role? Did you approach the role assuming he was guilty?It had nothing to do with the script and everything to do with Ryan Murphy. I was offered to play OJ in a feature film the week before meeting Ryan and I passed on it. I actually prefer to play historical characters that people know because the research and preparation is so much easier. However, it\u0027s my job to bring the truth to the performance.

Cuba Gooding Jr aka the funky Billy Flynn of Chicago here!Cuba Gooding Jr is in the building!Thirty years ago, Cuba Gooding Jr got a haircut from Eddie Murphy in a barbershop scene in Coming to America. Before long, the young actor with the big grin and bursting charisma was breaking through to major roles such as Tre Styles, a conflicted teen growing up in South Central Los Angeles in the blistering 1991 drama Boyz N the Hood.It was his role as an American football player in Jerry Maguire that brought him both an ultra-quotable line (“Show me the money!”) and an Oscar for best supporting actor. His exuberant acceptance speech is one of the most famous in the awards’ history.His Hollywood career has included the films As Good As It Gets, Pearl Harbor, Snow Dogs, American Gangster and Selma. Then, in 2016, he appeared in the breathtaking true-crime TV series The People vs OJ Simpson, delivering an Emmy-nominated performance as the actor-sportsman accused and acquitted of murder in a trial that gripped the US.Gooding is currently on stage in another sensational crime drama, playing the untouchable lawyer Billy Flynn in Kander and Ebb’s classic musical Chicago at the Phoenix theatre in London.

The Honor 10 View is still on sale for £450, which is £50 more than the Honor 10, and has a slightly bigger screen.The Honor 10 follows the trend set by Samsung with the Galaxy S6 three years ago of having glass on front and back. The glass on the back is curved, the phone’s edges are polished metal, making it feel almost exactly like a Samsung Galaxy S8 or S9. It’s smooth, feels very well made and is undoubtedly the most premium-feeling Honor yet that belies its “budget” market positioning.The 5.84in LCD screen fills most of the front of the device, short of a fingerprint sensor at the bottom and a notch into the screen at the top containing a selfie camera, earpiece speaker and sensor. It is proving to be the “year of the notch” and the Honor 10 is bang on trend.The screen looks very good, with solid brightness and colours, and it is pretty crisp. It isn’t as good as Huawei’s OLED screen on its top-end P20 Pro, nor the OLED screen on the closer competitor OnePlus 6, but it is still a good-looking display and most will be very pleased with it.Positioning fingerprint scanners on the front of the device isn’t a new thing, but the Honor 10 has one of the first commercially available ultrasonic fingerprint scanners (most others are capacitive). As such there’s no groove or other physical marking separating it from the glass. It works with damp hands, but requires a much firmer press than capacitive scanners and was a little slower than the Honor 10 View’s traditional fingerprint reader.At 153g and 7.7mm thick the Honor 10 feels pretty light and slim, stacking up well compared with top-end competition. The thin bezels around the relatively small screen mean it’s also quite small for a modern smartphone, and therefore easy to handle. There’s a headphone jack in the bottom, which is becoming a rare feature.The Honor 10 has the same processor as the Honor 10 View, Huawei Mate 10 Pro and P20 Pro, but has a smaller amount of RAM with only 4GB compared to 6GB. You can notice the difference – the Honor 10 is a little slower when switching between apps, but on the whole is a fast and smooth device to use. You have to pay another £69 to buy a phone that feels faster.Battery life is great, but not quite class-leading, lasting about 32 hours between charges, starting up at 7am on day one and dying at 3pm on day two.That was while using it as my primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, watching 90 minutes of Netflix, taking about 20 photos and listening to seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.The Honor 10 runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.1, based on the latest Android Oreo 8.1.It is essentially the same version as running on the Huawei P20 Pro, and very similar to every other recent Huawei phone, including the Mate 10 Pro and the Honor 10 View released earlier this year.EMUI looks like a cross between Android and Apple’s iOS. Out of the box it lacks Android’s app drawer, meaning every installed app has an icon on the homescreen, just like iOS, but there is an option to enable the drawer. Google Feed is available on the left-most homescreen pane, there’s a light customisation of notifications, but the big additions EMUI has over standard Android are power-saving features.For the most part these work very well – stopping apps from draining your battery in the background for example – but occasionally they will cause issues, stopping you receiving notifications or background functions. EMUI also handles the screen’s notch well, including the ability to hide it with an always-black status bar either side, just like the P20 Pro.The camera system on the Honor 10 is a bit of a mixed bag. On the back you have two cameras, one 16-megapixel and one 24-megapixel, which work in conjunction to produce images, simulate depth of field effects and other tricks.The cameras themselves are capable of producing some good photos. Low light isn’t the best, but it isn’t terrible either and on the whole the Honor 10 holds its own with the competition. The “AI camera” element is probably the worst bit.It’s meant to identify the scene and objects, but generally just produced photos that look like ultra-processed Instagram photos. It was particularly bad with grass, turning it highlighter green. I got much better results with it switched off.The selfie camera is good, but struggled to produce images that were pin sharp in dim indoor lighting.The Honor 10 comes in either blue, black or grey and costs £400.For comparison, the 6.28in OnePlus 6 costs £469 with 64GB of storage, the 6in Honor 10 View costs £450 with 128GB, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro costs £699 with 128GB, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL costs £799with 64GB, and the 5.8in iPhone X costs £999 with 64GB.The Honor 10 is another example of an excellent smartphone that comes very close to matching the latest top-of-the-range phones, but costs significantly less. On the whole Huawei has cut the right corners to make the Honor 10 shine against the competition.Of course it isn’t perfect, and lacks wireless charging and water resistance. But it has many redeeming features, feeling every bit as good in the hand as a phone costing twice as much. The screen is good, the camera (if you turn off the AI mode) is good, performance and battery life are good, and it even still has a headphone socket.The Honor 10 is so good I’m not quite sure why you would buy Huawei’s other 5.8in phone with a notch, the P20, that costs another £179, which means Huawei is competing with itself. Compared to rivals, you have to spend another £69 to find a better phone in the OnePlus 6, meaning the Honor 10 is arguably the best phone you can get right now for £400.Cons: no water resistance, no wireless charging, AI often makes the camera worse, no Bluetooth 5 support, glass back more fragile than metal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e4809a14d24bee7221aaaa00d060150e891e161/0_175_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a237e95caff9c7fc3f9231382969d6ae","title":"maglev magnetic levitation domestic travel","story":"It is lightning quick, clean, green – and expensive. But shouldn’t we think again about magnetic levitation?Clean, green, quick and quiet no wheels, no engines to fail able to stop quickly and safely and glide off noiselessly on a cushion of air.Magnetic levitation (maglev) was, according to 1980s science shows such as Tomorrow’s World, going to make domestic air travel defunct, humming from city to city at 500mph with negligible effects on the environment (and no need to remove your belt and shoes).With no wheels and only one track, Maglev trains would pooh-pooh bad weather, the wrong type of leaves on the line, or a points failure at Cricklewood. Because of the way maglev (in various ways) repels the train above its track, derailments are unlikely: the further the vehicle gets from its track, the stronger the magnetic force pushing it back. No signalling or moving parts to go wrong, with all the trains travelling at the same rate. Imagine the effect on commuting and by extension the economy – the Midlands would be half an hour from London.Amid the traffic jams and pollution, a greener mass transit solution makes sense more than ever.So why weren’t you able to glide to work at supersonic speeds this morning? The concept has been under development for over a century, with dozens of patents filed since the early 1900s. While there have only been a handful of commercially viable systems built, of which only three – all in Asia – survive today, more are now being tested around the world.Britain actually ran the world’s first: the Birmingham airport AirLink shuttle that ran from 1984-95. It was popular and cheap to run, but unreliable and expensive to maintain as the one-off components were hard to find.Germany also blazed a trail in the late 1980s with West Berlin’s M-Bahn, a driverless train on a mile of track with just three stations. But floating trains were put on the backburner and the line was closed with reunification in 1990. The manufacturer, TransRapid, maintained a test facility for the trains until an accident killed 23 in Lathen in 2006.That would have sealed it for German maglev had TransRapid not already been commissioned to build the Shanghai airport maglev in 2001. This remains the world’s fastest electric train (268mph), and makes the 19-mile, hour-long taxi journey from the airport to Shanghai’s business district in just eight minutes. China also has a medium-to-low speed (about 99mph) maglev line in operation in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. China likes maglev so much it says it plans to launch services in up to 12 cities by 2020.There are now several other maglev projects in progress in Asia the best known perhaps being the unmanned EcoBee shuttle that travels to and from South Korea’s Incheon airport. This shortish line linking seven stations along which the shuttle travels at the comparatively sedate 68mph was completed in 2012. And it’s free: Heathrow Express take note.Japan’s Linimo line near Nagoya runs a similar urban light rail-style vehicle at relatively low speeds. The Japanese are old hands at maglev, having laboured patiently (and expensively) with the technology since 1969. Their much more ambitious Chuo Shinkansen (central bullet train) maglev line is already under construction and will see trains eat up the 178 miles between Tokyo and Nagoya at 310mph – mostly underground.It can be done – so why can’t we do it? Why are we ripping up the Cotswolds to allow HS2 to blast noisily through our dwindling countryside when the Japanese will be able to silently tube through 178 miles in under 40 minutes?Money. If you’re going to build maglev you must do so from scratch. Most governments simply won’t take that hit, especially if standard rail infrastructure is already in place. Shanghai’s comparatively small maglev cost £840m to build, while Japan’s will be around £58bn. The US Federal Railroad Administration has balked at the up to $100m (£70m) per mile it estimates it would cost to build.Plus, there’s no guarantee of profit, and if that’s your motivation, the political will is unlikely to be forthcoming. Even the successful Asian projects were brought to fruition decades late and at great cost. Japan has been at it for four decades. The Shanghai line has been losing money – some 600-700m yuan (£70m to £82m) a year, in addition to its massively expensive build cost, since it floated in 2004.The Chinese government may be able to engage in such chest-thumping, but most governments will feel it’s cheaper to upgrade existing railways, unless the cash comes from private sources. But even the much vaunted, ostensibly private Japan Railways Group was for most of its history state-run, and even today is heavily subsidised. As for Britain, it has been suggested that the UK’s current power profile may mean maglev is uneconomical for long distances – hence no maglev HS2. Yet a state-run, clean, green, cheap rapid transit system should surely be an investment for the future, with big potential savings down the line in lower future maintenance and better reliability. Likewise, the Japanese Linimo line may have cost around £70m per km to build, but is proving to be low-maintenance, reliable and quiet compared with traditional transit systems (and ideal for cities, with its zero emissions). In the UK, it was estimated in 2006 that the cost of a maglev track would only have been half that of the Channel tunnel rail link.We should watch Asia with interest. If nothing else, they are showing that if there’s a political will, there’s a maglev railway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1c309eb18b6e6cbcd8162fc4ccc73aa00117f51/0_286_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c03f551a3f9ff3eef41e8e74b0a0ac3","title":"bbc king lear review anthony hopkins","story":"This BBC adaptation cuts the play to two hours, adds helicopters and mixed martial arts, and boasts fab performances all over the placeLondon at night, the capital’s priapic new edifices – the Shard, Gherkin etc – sparkle and thrust proudly skywards, something to do with the lusty stealth of nature perhaps. It looks a bit like the start of The Apprentice but it’s King Lear. “Nothing will come of nothing” … you’re fired.Just along the river, Gloucester and Kent (Jims Broadbent and Carter) arrive at the Tower in a black Range Rover. The king presumably will land at City airport in a Learjet. He doesn’t. They missed a trick there.Anyway, he’s already here at the Tower. In Richard Eyre’s TV adaptation, Lear (Anthony Hopkins) is a military dictator in the present, gathering the troops – and the family – for the ision of the kingdom.The north, and its powerhouse presumably, goes to Goneril (Emma Thompson). The West Country to Regan (Emily Watson, this is a seriously sparkly cast). The prosperous south-east is due to be Cordelia’s, until she fails in her filial flattery and is disinherited, disowned and sent to France (boo) instead.It’s really not such a leap of the imagination – the ageing, dangerous, male autocrat losing the plot. Or the power-passing down a generation. I thought of the Kims over in Pyongyang, another dynasty that also has favourite offspring, illegitimate offspring, a Midsomer body count and sibling poisoning. And the Murdochs.Anyway, the point is, Eyre’s TV Lear doesn’t just sparkle and shine with city lights and thespy stars, it hammers on the big bell of relevance as well. (The Bard should probably take some of the credit, too.)Shakespeare on television – a box it wasn’t designed for and doesn’t necessarily fit – isn’t always successful. It only works if it’s not just a play on the telly, but something in its own right, too, with its own identity. This one achieves that, with pace and modernity.No Learjets maybe, but there are helicopters, and other 21st-century weaponry, in the war between England and France. Kent’s disguise is a skinhead cut. Edmund and Edgar’s duel, an epic bout, is fought in the medium of … mixed martial arts. The heath has a busy A-road passing through it, along which to wander along – the A2 perhaps, on its way to Dover.It also encompasses a dreary city centre, the no-longer-new-town of Stevenage. That’s a memorable scene: Gloucester, now sightless, and Edgar, sitting on a bench in a concrete precinct, bumped into by Lear, in the full throes of madness, pushing his overflowing supermarket trolley around. That’s exactly where they’d be today, Stevenage. It’s not surprising to hear that a passerby mistook Hopkins for a homeless person and directed him to a hostel.I’m not Michael Billington (just to be clear): I cannot compare Hopkins’s performance with other great Lears I have known, to be honest I haven’t known that many. I can say it is that, though – a great one. Now 80 himself, the right age, Hopkins is at home in Lear’s skin. Shouty, angry, cruel one moment vulnerable, tender, loving the next – or at the same time. A mesmerising performance.Thompson’s power-hungry and cold Goneril reminded me of another Hopkins – Katie, who was in The Apprentice. There are fabulous performances all over the place I enjoyed Karl Johnson’s Fool and Christopher Eccleston’s oily Oswald. Plus, TV provides an intimacy you don’t get at the National Theatre. A bit too intimate, perhaps, in Gloucester’s eye-gouging. I’ve never been good with eye-gouging. In, stay in, “vile jelly!” I also enjoyed not sitting behind a Bard-bore, chortling loudly because he wants everyone to know that he knows that something is humour. Not too many gags in Lear, to be fair.Not only am I not Michael Billington, as I think I mentioned, I’m not even a Shakespearean scholar, you may be surprised\u0026nbspto hear. I did do King Lear at school, a very long time ago. And that’s enough: I’m in, focused, not wandering (well, not too much). The MMA and the helicopters and the fact that it’s only two hours long all help, but if this Fool can get involved and engage, then anyone can. You don’t even have to be an expert in 21st-century geopolitics (which I am). Have you got – or have you ever had, or are you perhaps – a father? Do you have a family? Of human beings? That’s all you need, and it’s better than The Apprentice. The wheel has come full circle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/440805d015670c60a555113d1b4c5c065aac87cf/0_6_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bcc6e778528e25bf510f6eed70f382f","title":"from friends to the office 10 best love triangles","story":"We celebrate the scenario that does more damage to telly characters than illness, accidents and murder combinedOnly a cold heart would fail to break for giant gooseberry Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek) as he watched his best friends, Joey (Katie Holmes) and Pacey (Joshua Jackson), sail off into the sunset together after years of indecision on Joey’s part. Pacey and Joey were obviously destined to spawn beautiful, chestnut-haired offspring from episode one. The moment these two velvety fawns laid their enormous brown eyes on each other, Dawson was out of the picture, but it took them all absolutely ages to realise it. Cue long summers of heart-tugging break-ups, huge, sad foal-eyes across crowded proms and Joey repeating that nervous hair-tuck until the tresses around her left ear went permanently bent. Poor Dawson could only look on like a terminally disparaged Ken doll as the love of his life cantered back up that beautifully appointed pier and into the waiting hooves of a waaaaaay hotter stallion. If you preferred Dawson to Pacey, you were scientifically wrong.Who would you choose to bang: a big-eyed boybander in a thong necklace or a kindly, asexual lion? My So-Called Life’s Angela Chase (Claire Danes) gave me weekly conniptions throughout the 90s with her idiotic refusal to see that neighbour Brian (the aforementioned lion played by Devon Gummersall) was the right boy for her. Instead, she homed in on vacant high-school heartthrob Jordan (Jared Leto) and his hypnotic python eyes. She thought she could save him from not being able to read good – but who could save her from her maddening over-thinking, and eventually turning into a jazz-mad FBI agent with a complicated personal life? Brian could’ve. But he didn’t get the chance because he was a cowardly lion as well as an asexual one and couldn’t fess up to his feelings at the crucial moment. Hence Carrie from Homeland was born.It always made sense that the two densest characters in Friends would eventually get it together. So when Rachel Green (Jennifer Aniston), who spent whole series oblivious to Ross’s tongue trailing on the floor whenever she was around, began having sex dreams about her good pal Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc) – who hadn’t heard of Stalin – the universe leaned back on its chair and agreed that this would go well. All except Ross (David Schwimmer) who, despite now dating Joey’s ex Charlie (improbably, a hot palaeontologist), couldn’t reach acceptance when it came to the new relationship. Self-medicating with too many margaritas, burning his hands on fajitas and squawking about how FINE he was failed to convince anyone. The universe (and the writers) eventually agreed that, however implausible, Ross really was Rachel’s lobster and the two should end the show re-coupled while Joey went off to present Top Gear.Possibly the most fun thing about the toxic friendship between Mark Corrigan (David Mitchell) and Jeremy Usbourne (Robert Webb) was the latter’s spiteful insistence on falling for the former’s romantic partners, just to enrage him. Not once but twice Jez decided he was hopelessly in love with Mark’s girl: first Sophie (Olivia Colman) and then Dobby (Isy Suttie). The two men ended up angrily competing to hold in their wee at a picnic before repeatedly electrocuting one another on a rural fence. Meanwhile, Dobs ditched the pair of them for a new life in New York – and who can blame her? Mark and Jez were meant to be together for eternity anyway and no woman was going to spoil that.Hardly a series goes by without there being some kind of sexy tension between the time-traversing eccentric and his younger, lissom female companion (which may or may not change with the arrival of Jodie Whittaker’s Time Lord). But back in the day (or forward: time has no meaning here) Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) had it bad for her Doctor (played by Christopher Eccleston, then David Tennant). It was Tennant’s incarnation that got the full force of Rose’s pout as, hanging off a ledge on some alien planet, she only occasionally remembered Mickey, the boyfriend back on Earth. His fate it was to look sadly at the space where the Tardis had been, wondering if he’d see her again. In the end, Rose swallowed time, went gold and moved to a parallel universe with a different version of her Doctor. The end.Before he had his empathy removed, Ricky Gervais co-wrote the tenderest love story between Dawn (Lucy Davies) and Tim (Martin Freeman) in The Office. Saddled with an archetypal “lad” who crushed her artistic soul, Dawn’s romantic muse was finally awoken by unassuming colleague Tim when he gave her some oil paints as a leaving present. Their eventual kiss to Yazoo’s Only You still makes you well up, as Dawn says she’s no longer engaged to Lee and goes for the full face-holder snog while a stunned Tim stands in the middle of the office Christmas party like a surprised mannequin. It was gratifying to see Tim, always the underdog, get the moment of romantic realisation he’d longed for – like never happens in real life.“I’m getting the brush-off for Captain Peroxide,” snarked altruistic blood-sucker Angel (David Boreanaz) to his vampire-slaying ex (Sarah Michelle Gellar) because she’d started seeing the Billy Idol lookalike. The perky evil-eradicator continued to hold a flame for Angel, despite plainly having a heap more deviant fun with the cockney blond who had a habit of crossing the room groin-first whenever she was in it and calling her “love”. Phwoargh. The great thing about dating undead men is the potential for rekindled romance long, long into the future. Angel and Buffy are almost certainly married now and having rows in Ikea for eternity.The final episode of Sex and the City saw Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) finally get together with Mr Big (Chris Noth) after a passionate pinball game that saw her ricocheting back to Big more than once, despite his toxicity and tendency to page his limo driver and flee every time intimacy or commitment loomed on the horizon. The notion of a love interest nicknamed for his alpha-ness has dated quickly but there’s no denying the power he had over the neurotic columnist, even when she was trying to forge a future with someone new. Poor furniture-maker Aidan (John Corbett) was good with wood but less so with the fluctuating affections of a girlfriend still in love with her impossible ex. The death knell came for their relationship when Aidan physically tried to rip down a wall between them, symbolism definitely intended, and Carrie had a panic attack trying on a wedding dress. It was always going to be the cigar-smoking, vineyard-owning, supremely wealthy commitment-phobe for Carrie. Go figure.Time to revisit this exemplary sitcom if you are unfamiliar. In it, Richard Briers plays Martin, a fastidious, beta-man with an exquisite wife named Ann (Penelope Wilton). Into their neatly arranged paradise comes Paul (Peter Egan), a louche salon-owner with one eyebrow permanently arched in sexual invitation. He toyed with his married neighbours for years, never quite understanding that Ann and Martin, for all her frustration, had a love that couldn’t be chipped by the semi-serious advances of an over-sexed hairdresser. Paul provided the grit that made Ann and Martin’s flawed oyster so beautiful. A more delicately balanced TV threesome you couldn’t wish to find.Sometimes, real life is more fascinating than fiction and so it was with Rod Burton, Freddy Marks and Jane Tucker who performed as the human musical trio in the children’s 70s-90s ITV puppet show, Rainbow. Jane and Rod had married and orced by the time young Freddy arrived to join the band. But there’s always a fascination with what goes on behind the sunny smiles and exaggerated dance moves of children’s TV and – despite the denial of scandal on all sides – Rod’s eyes remind me of a sad bear who’s lost its owner. After 30 years together, Jane and Freddy finally got married two years ago and everyone still appears to be friends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/624ac036f64b333811c25b15977598015bd37994/217_558_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b319949882825895e6a90ccd3db8ba6a","title":"macron hosts libyan factions in paris in push to secure elections","story":"President brings together rival leaders but move criticised by some as colonial interferenceThe French president, Emmanuel Macron, is to take a calculated risk by bringing Libyan factions together in Paris and having them commit to elections this year, in an attempt to end the chaos that has exacerbated the refugee crisis and caused economic misery for Libyans.Macron has invited Fayez al-Sarraj, the prime minister of the UN-recognised government, and Khalifa Haftar, the military leader who dominates in the east of the country, to the French capital on Tuesday in a move that has been denounced by some factions as colonial interference.The two leaders, along with two other major political Libyan figures, will commit to holding presidential and parliamentary elections this year. But there is a dispute as to whether such elections can come before an agreement on a new constitution – a matter about which there has been a negotiating deadlock for two years. The UN’s efforts to secure a deal ground to a halt a month ago.The 13-point accord expected to be agreed at the Paris summit will also seek a commitment to reform and unify the Libyan central bank, the body that collects the country’s growing oil revenues.Representatives of 20 countries, including the leaders of at least five African nations, will witness the signing of a new document committing to elections and to the imposition of sanctions if any signatory stands in the way of their occurrence.The two leaders of the rival Libyan parliamentary assemblies – the speaker of the house of representatives, Aguila Saleh Issa, and the Tripoli-based head of the high council of state, Khaled al-Mishri – are also attending.Various military factions in the west have either been excluded or decided to boycott the event, claiming France – alarmed by how much damage the Libyan political impasse can wreak in Europe – is biased towards quick elections that will benefit Haftar.Crisis Group, a thinktank that closely follows Libya, said the summit was risky and audacious. In a special report it said: “Reaching an accord could generate a brief moment of enthusiasm but risks being followed by recriminations when signatories – facing opposition by some of their allies back home – renege on their pledges. French organisers should avoid imposing too rigid a framework.”Macron summoned Haftar and Serraj to a similar summit a year ago, but the French officials say it is now clear Libyans want to hold presidential and parliamentary elections. The accord provides for extra time for voter registration to be completed.Broadly, the French, Emiratis and Egyptians are content for the elections to be held before a new constitution is agreed, but other key players such as Italy disagree, questioning how a country can elect a president if the office holder’s powers are not defined.Haftar’s commitment to democracy has been questioned by his critics, and in the run-up to the conference his Egyptian-backed force, the Libyan National Army, was making gains at the gates of Derna, a key coastal town held by Islamists.Haftar has presented himself to the west as a strongman that can bring order to the country and end the crisis that has seen more than 400,000 Africans trafficked through Libya to reach Italy by boat.The advance of populist parties in Italy has largely been put down to the Italian public’s anger at the failure to control the flow of African refugees and migrants.The scale of the public opposition appears to have caught pro-European Italians by surprise. Reflecting on the recent Italian elections, Emma Bonino, a former Italian minister, told a Paris seminar on Monday: “We knew there was a wave of scepticism, nationalism and racism that could come in but we did not know it would be a tsunami.”But there are fears that the pressure to find a solution will result in corners being cut. Speaking before the summit, Human Rights Watch France said: “The international community, but most of all Libyans, need to hear Libyan leaders pledge significant improvements to the rule of law, justice, and accountability – including for their own abusive forces – before organising elections.”It said Libyan authorities should pledge to ensure candidates can campaign freely without undue risk of attack set up an independent audit of the voter registry secure polling areas under their control and ensure there is sufficient court security to allow adjudication of disputes.Human Rights Watch said the current legal framework for holding elections remained opaque."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec04961d5d2014d47cf2cbe3a2d042dd8cc799ec/439_108_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6572236c5bb8b5773bcbe919c0fbc1bd","title":"north korea summit kim jong un aide singapore","story":"A top aide to the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was on his way to the US on Tuesday, Donald Trump said in a tweet.Another key aide to Kim arrived in Singapore on Monday night, a Japanese broadcaster said, adding weight to indications a planned summit with Trump will go ahead. Kim Chang-son, Kim’s de facto chief of staff, flew to Singapore via Beijing, the report by public broadcaster NHK said. South Korea’s Yohnap news agency reported that Kim Yong-chol, a former North Korean spy chief and senior official, was headed to the US after stopping over in Beijing.Trump appeared to confirm that in a tweet on Tuesday morning, sent in the middle of a sequence of complaints about the Russia investigation. Kim Yong-Chol is vice-chairman of the Workers’ Party’s Central Committee. Trump’s reference to a letter was to his cancellation of the summit last Thursday.A team of US officials including Joe Hagin, the White House deputy chief of staff for operations, left the Yokota airbase in Japan for Singapore on Monday, NHK said. The White House said a “pre-advance” team was travelling to meet North Koreans.It said Trump and the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, talked on the phone on Monday and confirmed they would meet before the “expected” US-North Korea summit. Trump and Abe “affirmed the shared imperative of achieving the complete and permanent dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons and ballistic missile programmes,” the White House said in a statement. The historic summit was initially scheduled for 12 June but Trump called it off last week. A day later, he said he had reconsidered and officials from both countries met to work out details. When Kim Chang-son was asked by a reporter at Beijing airport if he was flying to Singapore for talks with the US, he said he was “going there to play”, according to footage from Nippon Television Network. On Saturday, Kim Jong-un and South Korean president Moon Jae-in held a surprise meeting at the border village of Panmunjom, during which they agreed the North Korea-US summit must be held. South Korean officials have said Moon may travel to Singapore during the meeting, but that his attendance is dependent on preliminary meetings between the US and North Korea.On Sunday, the state department said US and North Korean officials had met at Panmunjom. Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea and current ambassador to the Philippines, led the American delegation, a US official told Reuters. Moon said on Monday there could be more impromptu talks between the two Koreas in the lead-up to the summit.In Kim and Moon’s first meeting on 27 April, they agreed to seek the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula – but did not define what that meant, or how that would proceed. Since then, North Korea has rejected US demands for it to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons. Analysts believe Washington is trying to determine whether North Korea is willing to agree on sufficient steps towards denuclearisation to allow a summit to take place. North Korea defends the existence of its nuclear and missile programmes by saying they are a deterrent against perceived aggression by the US, which keeps 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the Korean war which ended without a peace treaty in 1953.Pyongyang had long said it would be open to giving up its nuclear arsenal if the US withdrew its troops from South Korea and ended its “nuclear umbrella” alliance with Seoul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7587d0cba32c12c14dbb5383ec3cf4bb8e92181/0_167_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d8feaebeb28faf79c9ac27daa4f535a","title":"vitali klitschko kiev mayor boxing interview","story":"The Kiev mayor was one of the most dominant fighters of his era, and he says sport gave him skills he uses every day in his new careerBefore he became one of boxing’s most dominant heavyweight champions and even longer before he entered the decidedly more treacherous arena of Ukrainian politics, a teenage Vitali Klitschko led tourists visiting Kiev on excursions through the capital. He was 16 and it was his first paying job.Thirty years later Klitschko, who was elected mayor of Kiev four years ago, is still making his pitch for the hometown dear to his heart with the enthusiasm of a bright-eyed tour guide. The city was the heart of the sporting universe over the past week as it played host to Saturday’s Champions League final between Real Madrid and Liverpool, rolling out the red carpet for tens of thousands of tourists, and Klitschko was front and center throughout, walking the streets and snapping selfies with the visiting hordes when not working to resolve the airport imbroglio that imperiled many ticket-holders’ flights.It’s roughly eight hours before kickoff when we meet in his office on the ninth floor of the Kiev City State Administration building on the Khreshchatyk, the main drag in the city center. He’s just finished a call with Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson, playfully ribbing the card-carrying Everton fan for not making the trip. It’s been six years since he retired from boxing on top after a 15th successful heavyweight title defense, but the enviably fit 6ft 7in Klitschko looks as if he could still give anyone in the ision a tough night.“The biggest challenges are fixing the problems, to put all the puzzles together,” he says of playing host to the world’s biggest annual sporting event. “It’s a big honor for us and also a big responsibility with more than 50,000 visitors from outside the country. But everybody’s happy and there’s a great atmosphere. Many people ask me for a prediction for tonight: who will be the winner? The winner today is the city of Kiev and country of Ukraine. We’re the winner because it’s one more chance to present our city to the world.”When I ask him to assess his record – to compare his achievements with his ambitions when he took office in 2014 – Klitschko comes to life, rising from his boardroom table and walking towards a newspaper article pinned to a corkboard on the wall. The accomplishments are printed in blue and he proudly reads them off: the reconstruction of 500km of new roads to the European standard, the shuttering of illegal kiosks that infested parks and streets. The remaining challenges, in red, include further improvement of municipal services, fighting back against companies that build illegally and fixing the city’s nightmarish parking situation.Klitschko, who holds a PhD in sports science, earned $60m during his boxing career and could have easily retired into a life of comfort. But he was compelled to enter the cutthroat world of Ukrainian politics – formally entering the fray with a second-place finish in the Kiev mayoral race in 2006 – out of a deep love for his country and a potential for greatness he believed went untapped.“I remember the Soviet Union and when the Iron Curtain fell down in 1991,” he recalls. “I was just 20 years old and everybody had a dream to live in a modern democratic society, in a modern country. More than 15 years passed and nothing changed. There’s a saying I like very much: if you want a thing done well, do it by yourself.”He pressed forward while still reigning as WBC heavyweight champion, winning election to parliament in 2012 as a member of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform (Udar) party, which he founded, and became one of the country’s most visible political leaders during the pro-western revolution two years later. Some even believed he would succeed Viktor Yanukovych as president, but he instead backed Petro Poroshenko to avoid splitting the vote and won the mayoral election in 2014.The overarching philosophy of Klitschko’s political theory, as he explains it, is eliminating the corruption deeply embedded in the system.“The Soviet system is how everything here works,” he explains. “It’s very difficult to break the system. The system is big and inflexible, uneffective and also corrupt. And that is our main goal, to change the system, to break the system, to make it modern.Sport remains dear to Klitschko’s heart – he’s at the gym at six every morning and at the office by nine – and he still makes time to watch the big fights, particularly the ision he dominated so ruthlessly. He believes Britain’s Anthony Joshua, the current WBA and IBF heavyweight champion, “has all the skills” to be one of the ision’s greats, but won’t get to the next level until he goes through with a unification bout against American Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC title.“The question always when there are many world champions is: who is the strongest one?” he says. “That’s why to fight Wilder is very good. Right now Joshua is a champion. With this fight, he can be a star.”Klitschko’s record in the ring was formidable. He won 45 of his 47 professional fights (including 41 by knockout) and made three separate title reigns, becoming the only heavyweight champion ever to hold the title in three separate decades. A devastating puncher with a granite chin, he went through his entire career without getting knocked down or taken a standing eight count. It’s not a stretch to suggest that he would have finished his career undefeated if not for bad luck with injuries: both of his defeats came on injury stoppages while he was ahead on the scorecards. Yet more than fame and fortune, Klitschko believes the sport offered essential preparation for his second career.“Sports gave me the strengths I use every day,” he says. “For one, it’s very important to have a good team around you. Early in my career I was told if you want to be the best in the sport, take the best coach, take the best promoter, take the best manager, take the best lawyer and with the best team you will be automatically be the best. Exactly the same. I’ve tried to find the good people, good people who will take responsibility.

Top temperatures will be between 21 and 26 degrees with parts of the west and south of the country set to experience the best of the weather. Met Éireann said early mist and fog patches will clear in most places on Tuesday morning, allowing warm sunny intervals to develop. While many areas will hold dry, some heavy showers will occur on Tuesday afternoon, these most likely in west Connacht and Munster where there is also the risk of isolated thunderstorms. Warm sunshine is likely through Tuesday evening, with any showers dying away. It will be a dry night with patches of mist and low cloud returning. Wednesday is due to be a warm and mostly dry day with a mix of cloud and sunshine once early mist and fog patches lift. There is a slight risk of isolated showers, mainly over southern counties through the afternoon and evening. Highest temperatures will be between 20 and 24 degrees. The national forecaster said Thursday and Friday will be somewhat cloudier days with scattered showers and some sunshine with top temperatures between 17 and 21 degrees. Current indications suggest scattered showers on Saturday and Sunday with light to moderate winds and highest temperatures ranging between 16 to 21 degrees. Dun Laoghaire Coast Guard was called out to the Forty Foot on Monday to deal with an injured swimmer. “On arrival, a casualty had been removed from the water after striking a rock and immediate first aid treatment was given by a GP and a member from Greystones Coast Guard who was swimming in the area,” a spokesman said. “Dun Laoghaire RNLI offshore was also tasked to provide assistance, as it was out training at the time. Along with Dun Laoghaire Coast Guard members and NAS Paramedics the conscious casualty was treated and carried to the awaiting ambulance for further care.” The spokesman said while the Forty Foot is a beautiful spot, it is also a dangerous swimming area. “There are many hiding rocks not visible to the naked eye. Please heed the warning signs, they are there for a reason,” he added. The ESB has issued a reminder to the public of the dangers and potential serious consequences of swimming in any ESB reservoir due to the risk of uneven ground, deep waters, changing water levels and fast-flowing waters. These include the reservoirs at Poulaphoca and Golden Falls in Wicklow, Leixlip in Kildare, Inniscarra and Carrigadrohid in Cork, the Ardnacrusha headrace and tailrace canal in Clare and Dunlewey Lough, Assaroe and Lough Nacung in Donegal. Separately, the ISPCA has issued a warning regarding keeping pets safe in the warm weather. “Leaving a car window open for your pet isn’t sufficient enough to prevent heatstroke in intense sun,” it said. “Even ten minutes can prove fatal.”And the Irish Cancer Society has said 10,000 people a year are diagnosed with skin cancer but it is largely preventable “by being smart in the sun”. The charity has published a SunSmart Code on its website.

Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

The CBI, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Small Business Federation and the EFF, the manufacturers’ organisation, want the UK prime minister to “get on” with the enlargement of Heathrow airport. A vote had been planned before parliament’s summer recess in July. If the deadline passes, the dread is a political class too lost in the next stage of Brexit to address the footling matter of national (in Heathrow’s case, global) infrastructure.Notice what the employers fear is trickling away here: not support for their cause, but the time and space for it. May wants an expanded Heathrow. The Conservatives made it a manifesto pledge last year. The parliamentary votes can, with effort, be assembled. What troubles business is Brexit’s potential to crowd out the project, as it does so much else.The parable of Heathrow illuminates Britain’s predicament since 2016. History might come to record the real cost of Brexit as all the other things not done. A generation of MPs, civil servants and public intellectuals are engaged with one open-ended mission. It is where they must spend their energies and political capital.People who entered public service to reform the economy or see the National Health Service through the costly dotage of the baby boomers will lose vital years to the dry work of unmooring from the EU and recreating the best bits of it. Even if the direct cost of exit turns out to be as exaggerated as Leavers suggest, the opportunity cost is, if anything, underplayed.A sense of those forgone opportunities is free to read online. In Square Deal, the Conservative MP Nick Boles has written a programme for national renewal that touches on healthcare, housing and employment. His muse is the US presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, who neutered the appeal of America’s early 20th-century populists with his own blend of active government, popular capitalism and assertiveness abroad. There is in Square Deal the filling, not just the outlines, of an electable form of Toryism.The difference is that Roosevelt’s federal government was not occupied with a huge constitutional project. Reformers closer to home, namely the prime ministers Clement Attlee (after 1945) and Margaret Thatcher (in the 1980s), had the same good fortune to govern while the basic rules of state did not constitute a distraction. The next prime minister who will be able to do the same is probably not in parliament yet.It is possible that the “next election will not be defined by Brexit”, as Boles predicts, but the business of state still might be. Twelve years passed between Britain’s first application to join the European project in 1961 and its ultimate accession in 1973. It would be no shock if, in 2028, 12 years after the vote to leave, Britain were still negotiating features of its relationship with an EU that is itself in flux.The political, diplomatic, technical and intellectual work that goes into the management of this bilateral tie will allow for few other undertakings of real weight. And even this does not budget for the emotional rawness of an electorate that is ided on the matter. Would the nation tolerate another round of isive change on, say, housing?Leavers will contest this neat line between constitutional change and the “real” work of government. They see the EU’s curbs on a member state’s freedom of action as the true block on domestic reform. A bold government must be sovereign in the first place. But even leaving aside the obvious rejoinder (which Thatcherite idea was stymied by Brussels?), there are only so many hours in a day and only so many high-risk ventures the public will bear in one phase of history. Central to politics is the picking of battles, and Britain has picked an all-absorbing one.It is a lapse into mawkishness to say that the best minds of their generation are being wasted on a fool’s errand. The best minds are not in parliament, Whitehall or the commentariat. Nor can anyone be certain that Brexit will look foolish in a decade’s time. What is going to waste is what the modern argot obliges us to call “bandwidth”.Britain has not the time or energy for much besides Brexit. It volunteered for a new challenge before fixing such old ones as productivity and infrastructure. If a third runway at Heathrow is to be a good idea postponed, it will not be the only one.These are the Lost Years. We can but guess how many of them there will be, and what we might have done with them instead. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano

I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter.

President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policyOne man missing after devastating flash floods rip through Ellicott City,  MarylandBritish forces should be \u0026#39committed to Iraq for next few years\u0026#39, says UK GeneralKim Yong Chol, the former North Korean spy chief accused of sinking of a South Korean shipDeath threats made against Italy\u0026#39s president after he blocks populist government100ft lava fountains spark mass evacuation in HawaiiStarbucks to close over 8,000 coffee shops in the US for racial bias trainingManchester Airport gate evacuated after crack appears in floor causing panic for travellersEnergy firm apologises after power cut kills 60 tropical fish at nursery school Belgium shooting: Terror investigation launched after \u0026#39released prisoner\u0026#39 kills two police officers before taking hostage in LiegeKim Jong-un\u0026#39s right-hand man Kim Yong-chol travelling to US for talksRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedWalk-outs as Syria takes over as chair of global disarmament body\u0026#39This is not a sign\u0026#39: The best hidden jokes from Peter Kay\u0026#39s Car ShareDesigner forced to address critics after claiming Meghan Markle’s wedding dress was ‘identical’ to one of hersBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 1: A technical fault, Dec without Ant, and a worthy winner of the public voteMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaGarry Newlove\u0026#39s killers set for release from prison as \u0026#39frustrated\u0026#39 widow calls for change in lawIsrael sees an opportunity to drive Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsNew Jersey police investigated after punching woman in the head during arrestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"prosecco no longer considered luxury experts say","story":"Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook Champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasionsBritain has reached peak prosecco because it is no longer seen as a luxury, figures suggest.Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions.But now, for the first time, prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, it found.Some 35.8 gallons of sparkling wine were sold during the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A five per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give prosecco and champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Crémant vs crémant - the new fizz warsWine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity are French crémant sparkling wines, which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.One man missing after devastating flash floods rip through Ellicott City,  MarylandBritish forces should be \u0026#39committed to Iraq for next few years\u0026#39, says UK GeneralKim Yong Chol, the former North Korean spy chief accused of sinking of a South Korean shipDeath threats made against Italy\u0026#39s president after he blocks populist government100ft lava fountains spark mass evacuation in HawaiiStarbucks to close over 8,000 coffee shops in the US for racial bias trainingManchester Airport gate evacuated after crack appears in floor causing panic for travellersEnergy firm apologises after power cut kills 60 tropical fish at nursery school Belgium shooting: Terror investigation launched after \u0026#39released prisoner\u0026#39 kills two police officers before taking hostage in LiegeKim Jong-un\u0026#39s right-hand man Kim Yong-chol travelling to US for talksRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedWalk-outs as Syria takes over as chair of global disarmament body\u0026#39This is not a sign\u0026#39: The best hidden jokes from Peter Kay\u0026#39s Car ShareDesigner forced to address critics after claiming Meghan Markle’s wedding dress was ‘identical’ to one of hersBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 1: A technical fault, Dec without Ant, and a worthy winner of the public voteMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaGarry Newlove\u0026#39s killers set for release from prison as \u0026#39frustrated\u0026#39 widow calls for change in lawIsrael sees an opportunity to drive Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsNew Jersey police investigated after punching woman in the head during arrestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164866705_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"regular meetings ruin productivity workers worry running late","story":"Staff anticipating a meeting mentally subtract the time they have availableRegular meetings ruin productivity because workers are constantly worried about running late, a study has found.Staff anticipating a meeting - or people expecting a friend for dinner - mentally subtract up to 30 per cent of the time they have available.Scientists found that having created an unnecessary buffer “in case something comes up”, people perform fewer tasks, or smaller tasks, than if their next appointment was not looming over them.Researchers at Ohio state University’s Fisher College of Business asked participants how long they could spend reading an hour before an appointment for which they were fully prepared.  Respondents said they had 50 minutes available, and even said that subjectively it felt like they had only 40 minutes..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}You don’t feel like you can get as much done when you have a task coming up soon.

He applied to renew the visa in April but did not immediately receive approval from the Home Office amid diplomatic tension between London and Moscow.It is unclear if the UK decided to reject his application permanently but a source familiar with the matter told The Daily  that the renewal process seemed to be taking an unusually long time.Amber Rudd ordered a review of the visa status of wealthy Russians after the Salisbury nerve agent attackMr Abramovich is believed to have returned to Russia after his visa expired. He did not attend Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup at Wembley on May 19.Israeli passport holders can travel to Britain without a visa for short periods of time, and can stay as long as six months. Russians must apply for a visa from the British Embassy in Moscow if they wish to travel to Britain.Mr Abramovich\u0027s decision comes after the Government suggested it would take a harder line on Russian oligarchs in Britain following the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.His private G650 jet touched down at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Monday and he was immediately granted Israeli citizenship. A spokesman for the Israeli interior ministry said he applied at the Israeli embassy in Moscow and was found eligible for citizenship after proving his Jewish heritage. “He filed a request to receive an immigration permit, his documents were checked according to the Law of Return, and he was indeed found eligible,” the spokesman told Israel’s Channel 10 news. Mr Abramovich previously purchased a £17.1 mansion in Tel Aviv’s upmarket Neve Tzedek neighbourhood.

hand man reportedly way washington talks","story":"The latest move is further evidence that the summit could still go aheadFormer North Korean spy chief and senior official Kim Yong Chol is heading to the US for high level talks aimed at reviving the prospects of a summit in Singapore between Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump.Kim Yong Chol, one of the most influential North Koreans outside of the Kim dynasty, had been closely involved with talks with South Korea. He is the most senior North Korean official to set foot in the US since 2000, in a further indication that preparations for the historic summit, initially planned for June 12, are moving ahead.His trip comes just days after President Trump cancelled the one-on-one meeting with Kim Jong-un in a letter citing North Korea\u0027s hostility.But after a conciliatory response from Pyongyang on Friday and an impromptu meeting on Saturday between the North Korean leader and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, where Kim expressed his commitment to progress on denuclearisation, the talks now seem to be on again. President Trump announced General Kim\u0027s visit in a tweet on Tuesday, welcoming progress.We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young (sic) Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you! he said.Kim Jong-un had a surprise meeting with Moon Jae-in on SaturdayAs part of ongoing efforts to find common ground, the US has reportedly decided to defer the launch of another round of severe sanctions against Pyongyang.Mr Kim is due to fly to New York on Wednesday after speaking to officials in Beijing. Kim Chang-son, another top aide to the North Korean leader, arrived in Singapore on Tuesday for meetings with a delegation of senior White House officials, including Joe Hagin, deputy chief of staff for operations, reported Japan’s NHK. When Mr Kim, known as Kim Jong-un’s “butler”, was asked by a reporter at Beijing airport if he was flying to Singapore for talks with the US, he said he was “going there to play”, according to footage from Nippon Television Network.  However, officials from both sides are believed to be engaging in the intense logistics of arranging the first ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader. Separately, a US team led by veteran negotiator and former ambassador to South Korea, Sung Kim, has been meeting with North Korean officials in the demilitarised zone iding the Korean peninsula to discuss the summit agenda and the wording of a possible communique. Grand deal between Donald Trump and North Korea could be the worst possible outcomeMoon Jae-in, who has lobbied hard for nuclear negotiations between Mr Trump and Kim, has battled to keep the summit alive.Despite Kim\u0027s apparent eagerness for a summit with Mr Trump, there are lingering doubts on whether he would ever agree to fully relinquish his nuclear weapons when he may see them as his only guarantee of survival. Mr Moon has insisted Kim can be persuaded to abandon his nuclear facilities, materials and bombs in a verifiable and irreversible way in exchange for credible security and economic guaranteesGeneral Kim Yong Chol (C) leaving the DMZ separating North and South Korea in February But US and North Korean officials are racing to bridge a gulf between the two sides over the definition of denuclearisation before the two leaders meet. At Kim’s conciliatory first meeting with Moon Jae-in on April 27, they agreed to seek the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, but used vague wording that did not clearly define it. Since then, North Korea has rebuffed US demands for it to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons programme, which it views as a deterrent against perceived aggression by the US, which keeps 28,500 troops based in South Korea. Washington, meanwhile, is trying to determine whether Pyongyang is willing to agree on sufficient steps that would allow the two sides to proceed with the summit. Before cancelling the event, Mr Trump had indicated that he may be open to a more phased approach. The New York Times on Monday reported that Siegfried Hecker, a top federal adviser who has repeatedly visited the North’s sprawling atomic complex, has warned that the disarmament process could take up to 15 years.Please review our commenting policyOne man missing after devastating flash floods rip through Ellicott City,  MarylandBritish forces should be \u0026#39committed to Iraq for next few years\u0026#39, says UK GeneralKim Yong Chol, the former North Korean spy chief accused of sinking of a South Korean shipDeath threats made against Italy\u0026#39s president after he blocks populist government100ft lava fountains spark mass evacuation in HawaiiStarbucks to close over 8,000 coffee shops in the US for racial bias trainingManchester Airport gate evacuated after crack appears in floor causing panic for travellersEnergy firm apologises after power cut kills 60 tropical fish at nursery school Belgium shooting: Terror investigation launched after \u0026#39released prisoner\u0026#39 kills two police officers before taking hostage in LiegeRoman Abramovich becomes an Israeli citizen a month after his UK visa was delayedWalk-outs as Syria takes over as chair of global disarmament body\u0026#39This is not a sign\u0026#39: The best hidden jokes from Peter Kay\u0026#39s Car ShareDesigner forced to address critics after claiming Meghan Markle’s wedding dress was ‘identical’ to one of hersBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent, semi-final 1: A technical fault, Dec without Ant, and a worthy winner of the public voteMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaGarry Newlove\u0026#39s killers set for release from prison as \u0026#39frustrated\u0026#39 widow calls for change in lawIsrael sees an opportunity to drive Iran out of Syria as Russia looks to its own interestsNew Jersey police investigated after punching woman in the head during arrestDozens of mortars fired from Gaza into Israel in heaviest barrage since 2014 warWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/29/TELEMMGLPICT000164885207_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8W44mZEW0zcVUHYed3romlTvoygpwMu-cvyeL-Sdk00.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"manchester airport gate evacuated crack appears floor causing","story":"Manchester Airport has been evacuated following damage to a building wallPassengers were forced to evacuate from a section of Manchester Airport after reports of the building “collapsing”.Photos shared on Twitter show a crack which appeared beside a metal beam where travellers were boarding a flight to Palma at gate 212 in Terminal Two.The airport say another crack has appeared in the floor which is causing the issue prompting the fire service to be called in order to evacuate passengers safely from the gate.Gate 212 is currently housed inside a temporary building while work is taking place at the airport.Passengers said they heard a loud noise at around 7am causing “everyone to panic”.Andrea Atherton tweeted a photo of the crack, writing: “Been stood for 20 minutes where the temporary floors sound like they are collapsing.

But his company stands ready to help out if it does not happen quickly enough, he said.In the short term, Mr Bezos and his company hope to simply reduce the cost of getting to space, and will soon launch ships aimed at launching rockets that can carry people up into space. Unlike SpaceX – set up by fellow technology billionaire Elon Musk – Blue Origin does not aim to head to Mars but is concentrating on more nearby destinations.Nasa reveals stunning first picture from planet-hunting satelliteEventually, those rockets could carry people up to space so that there are millions of people living and working off Earth. People might opt to stay on our planet, which will become a residential zone, but they will not have to, he said.“We will have to leave this planet,” Mr Bezos said, according to Geek Wire. “We’re going to leave it, and it’s going to make this planet better. We’ll come and go, and the people who want to stay, will stay.”All of the heavy industry will leave, and will be conducted in space using solar energy, he suggested.“The Earth is not a very good place to do heavy industry. It’s convenient for us right now,” he said. “But in the not-too-distant future — I’m talking decades, maybe 100 years — it’ll start to be easier to do a lot of the things that we currently do on Earth in space, because we’ll have so much energy.”The plans to establish a colony on the moon serves as a bridge between the short-term work on the new rockets and the long-term plan to help humanity leave the Earth. By establishing a colony on our nearest neighbour, we would be able to begin our journey towards living in space – and that could be conducted by a range of different organisations, both public and private, all at once.“The Moon Village concept has a nice property in that everybody basically just says, look, everybody builds their own lunar outpost, but let’s do it close to each other, he said. That way, if you need a cup of sugar, you can go over to the European Union lunar outpost and say, ‘I got my powdered eggs, what have you got?\u0027Obviously I’m being silly with the eggs, but there will be real things, like, ‘Do you have some oxygen?’”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Though expensive enough for single people, couples and families living abroad can easily find themselves spending many thousands of pounds on a citizenship application once the UK’s charges for leaving are taken into account. The department says the sharp increase reflects an increased cost of handling applications – at the same time as British people applying for foreign passports surged.Figures from EU statistics agency Eurostat show the number of British people seeking the citizenship of other countries had increased by 165 per cent in the year of the referendum compared with the previous year. Inidual figures from other countries show a sustained increase in similar applications throughout 2017.Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to makeMichael Harris, British in EuropeThe increase was sharpest for some countries that ban dual citizenship: the number of British people adopting Dutch passports increased from 166 British citizens in 2015 to 636 in the year of the referendum, a 283 per cent increase. Though the Dutch government is changing the law to allow Dutch citizens living in Britain to adopt dual citizenship – to cushion them from the referendum result – no such exemption has been made for British citizens living in the Netherlands.Campaigners said the move to hike the fees had added to the “painful” decision many British people had taken to renounce their nationality, which most only did because they feel they have no other option to secure their future.“The increase will just add to the difficulties people face in countries like the Netherlands which do not allow dual nationality,” said Michael Harris, a Briton living abroad and a member of the British in Europe steering committee.“Renouncing nationality is a last resort for people whose livelihood is in danger and an extremely painful decision to make.”Countdown to Brexit: what is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder said: “This is the Conservative Brexit government and the Home Office giving Brits in the EU the last kick out the door. Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

It will decimate our public services and see household incomes plunge.Those supporting it must come clean over the likely consequences of ‘no deal’, or they must stop beating the drum for inevitable economic ruin.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The prime minister\u0027s official spokesman dismissed the criticism and insisted the government was actively planning for all Brexit scenarios.The spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “The prime minister has said many times, most recently in her Mansion House speech – we take the issue seriously and a responsible government we continue to plan for a range of scenarios.“At the budget the chancellor committed an additional £3bn of funding so that departments and the devolved administrations can continue to prepare effectively for all Brexit scenarios, and over £1.5bn of this was allocated for 1819 in the spring statement.“That’s in addition to the £700m already made available to prepare for Brexit.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the same period wages have increased by just 6 per cent, suggesting the scheme is increasingly helping only those with higher incomes.The average household income in the UK is £25,700, although this is after direct taxes have been deducted, whereas the Help to Buy data relates to pre-tax wages.Last year £2.9bn of loans were paid out – a jump from £2.1bn the year before. Despite criticism of where the money is going, Theresa May has promised a further £10bn of investment in the scheme – enough to help fund more than 400,000 new homes.Labour said the figures were proof that Help to Buy is not helping those who most need support with housing costs.The world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThe world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThis is the fifth year that Melbourne has won top placeJohn Healey, the party’s shadow housing secretary, said: “With the number of younger people who own a first home in free fall, government ministers need to be doing much more to help people on ordinary incomes buy a first home of their own.“Deep cuts to housing investment mean that the number of new low-cost homes to buy like shared ownership have halved since 2010, and badly targeted schemes like Help to Buy aren’t focused on those who most need a hand up.“Labour would refocus Help to Buy to help first-time buyers on ordinary incomes.”It comes after the Resolution Foundation suggested Help to Buy should be scrapped, saying it drives up house prices and takes money away from other areas of housing.The average new build property now costs £50,000 more than when the scheme was introduced in 2013, it said.The think tank said in a report: “HTB appears to have served a useful purpose when it was first introduced – restoring confidence to developers and promoting a pickup in house building. But its effect looks increasingly distortionary, suggesting that it may be time to phase it out.”It added: “Since early 2016 the growth in new-build prices has outpaced price growth for existing resold property, strongly suggesting that equity loans have enabled developers to set prices at higher levels than otherwise.”In the meantime, it said, a household income cap should be introduced on Help to Buy loans to ensure public money is benefiting people on low and middle incomes.Number of social housing properties in England drops 11 per cent in one yearOfficial data reveals that the scheme, designed to help aspiring homeowners get on the housing ladder, also continues to directly benefit thousands of people who already own a property.Almost one in five Help to Buy beneficiaries are already homeowners, and on average these recipients are wealthier than first-time buyers, with an income £8,500 higher.The Independent has previously revealed how millions of pounds of public funds are being loaned to people with an income of more than £100,000.The latest figures reveal that more than 6,200 households with an income of more than £100,000 have benefited from taxpayer-funded loans.A spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Our Help to Buy scheme has assisted over 440,000 people buy a home of their own since 2010, with a majority of households having an income of £50,000 or less.“Help to Buy is getting people onto the housing ladder and last year we saw the highest number of first time buyers in over a decade.”help to buyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Shi\u0027s brother then called Redding police. Officers found Mr Shi, Mr McConkey and Ms Hoser at Redding Municipal Airport, about seven miles from his apartment. Ms Hoser told police they were sending Mr Shi back to China because his English was not strong enough to safely communicate with the air traffic control tower, Mr Peterson said. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron meets with Mamoudou Gassama, 22, from Mali, at the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris.

The spat led to the collapse of talks to form a M5SLeague coalition government.Mr Mattarella has asked former International Monetary Fund (IMF) official Carlo Cottarelli to form a new technocrat government. The economist, 64, is known as “Mr Scissors” for his cuts to Italy’s public spending. Italy’s political crisis could have devastating effects on the euroMr Cottarelli will look to present a programme to parliament, including a budget, and aim for elections early next year. However, it is unlikely he will gain the support of the parliament, meaning elections would be pushed forward to August this year.Matteo Salvini, the leader of the League, which was part of the right-wing coalition that gained 37 per cent of the vote in the March elections, and the M5S’s Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the single biggest inidual share of the vote, have both switched to campaign mode and have called for protests against the decision by Mr Mattarella.Early elections would suit both parties, with Mr Salvini and Mr Di Maio, having made much of the narrative that the Italian and wider European establishment are getting in the way of the will of the Italian people. There were reports on Monday that M5S may even consider campaigning with the League in any new vote. However, as a matter of fact, it is the League that can take advantage from a fresh election seemingly better than anyone else. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFrench President Emmanuel Macron meets with Mamoudou Gassama, 22, from Mali, at the presidential Elysee Palace in Paris.

A tax fraud conviction prevented Mr Berlusconi, who served multiple terms as Italian prime minister, from running for office in March. A Milan court ruled this month that he is now eligible, and he suggested on Monday he is open to running for office in new elections. However, Mr Diamanti says that the “X-factor” of the League, which was a regional, Northern Italy secessionist party, is having turned into a nationalist, anti-immigrant and eurosceptic party. “Now that the League is the Italian version of French Front National (FN), Mr Salvini is the one that capitalises on people’s rage the most,” Mr Diamanti said. And Mr Salvini seems to be aware of that: “I’m very angry”, he wrote on Facebook a few days ago, referring to the decisions from Mr Mattarella, before blaming “Paris, Brussels and the financial system”. As Italy prepares for new elections, whenever they come, Mr Mattarella’s move of rejecting the eurosceptic economist Mr Savona might end up opening up a route for the populists to gain even more votes than before.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But it gave our opponents a political veto.She added: Countries use whatever currency arrangements that best suit their needs and Scotland would have options in that regard, as we would have done in 2014.But we look forward to debating the report\u0027s recommendations over the next few months."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Jeremy-Corbyn-and-Richard-Corbett-966168.jpg","title":"brexit news labour eu mep richard corbett jeremy corbyn 2nd referendum","story":"He also claimed the party frontbench had not ruled out a fresh national poll to allow voters to reconsider Brexit.His remarks, in an online interview published on his own website, yesterday threatened to intensify the angry row over Labour ranks about the party\u0027s stance in the debate about Britain\u0027s future relationship with Brussels.Mr Corybn, the party\u0027s hard-Left leader is facing a damaging rift in party ranks as the Commons prepares for a series of crunch votes on Theresa May\u0027s flagship Brexit legislation.In his interview, Mr Corbett claimed there was a growing clamour for a second EU referendum vote.Richard Corbett raised fresh concerns about Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s European Policy                A word from the Editor by MARTIN TOWNSEND                Labour\u0026rsquos FAILED project: Unite try to SAVE Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos GlastonburyI\u0027m not surprised there is a growing clamour, even from people who voted Leave, to say we want to be able to reconsider because Brexit\u0027s turning out to be somewhat different from what was promised by the Leave campaign, said Mr Corbett, who is leader of Labour\u0027s MEPs.Far from being in lots of money that would all go to the NHS, it\u0027s costing an arm and a leg. Far from helping our economy, it is damaging it.Far from having easy new trade deals with the rest of the world that is looking rather dodgy and unlikely, or at least not on terms that would be beneficial to Britain.So it\u0027s not surprising people are saying it is all very well to vote for Brexit as a general principle but we want a say on the actual Brexit deal once we can see what it really entails - that\u0027s not an unreasonable request, he said.All of Labour\u0027s 20 MEPs backed the idea that Brexit should be reconsidered.At this stage the Labour Party has not called for a second referendum because we\u0027re still in the phase of discovering where the ided government is going.But the Labour movement hasn\u0027t ruled it out either.If we are faced with a Brexit deal that the Government brings back which is manifestly damaging for Britain which is rejected by the House of Commons and you have a ratification crisis, we\u0027ve said the House of Commons should then determine where we then go next.Mr Corbett said that if a majority of MPs did not approve any treaty agreed by Mrs May, the Commons could send the Government back to Brussels to try to renegotiate it.Read the full 7,000-word agreement on the Brexit deal                    EPA1 of 17Here is the 15 page Brexit deal in fullWe\u0027ve said the House of Commons should then determine where we go next and of course one of the options, one of the options say go away and negotiate something different or better. Another option is to reconsider Brexit, he said, adding: It\u0027s a democratic principle - you must have the right to reconsider. I\u0027m very sympathetic to that point of view.He claimed Labour\u0027s frontbench had not reached a position on whether to try to force a second referendum vote.All Labour\u0027s 20 MEPs backed the idea that Brexit should be reconsidered, Mr Corbett said.Speaking knowing the opinion of many, I think of all my fellow MEPs, all I can say is that there is a lot of sympathy for the view that if the deal comes back is a bad isive costly bad for Britain deal, it\u0027s not unreasonable to say that there should be a chance to reconsider it, he said.He also pledged to press the case for reconsidering Brexit within Labour\u0027s shadow cabinet.There\u0026rsquos a lot of lively debates in the Labour Party around the Shadow Cabinet table, which I attend, he said.Mr Corbett also distanced himself from claims from some Labour frontbenchers that the party will back Government plans to quit the EU customs union.Leaving the customs union is rather job destroying, bad for our economy we should remake sure we remain in a customs union, he said.It\u0027s feared the UK\u0026rsquos transition deal with the European Union will leave the its fishing industry at the EU\u0027s mercy                    PA1 of 7UK fishermen fear the EU will impose laws that shrink British fishing fleets Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis said: \u0026ldquoLabour are only interested in frustrating Brexit.\u0026ldquoThe fact that such a senior Labour figure is openly speculating about reversing Brexit entirely shows they do not respect the referendum result, and they couldn\u0026rsquot deliver the change British people voted for.\u0026ldquoOnly the Conservatives have a plan for Brexit which means taking back control of our laws, borders and money, while Labour\u0026rsquos approach would get us the worst possible deal.Research recently published by the Tories found that senior Labour figures have backed or failed to rule out a second referendum at least 40 times in recent months even though aides insist Mr Corbyn is not in favour of such a poll.Commons could send the Government back to Brussels to try to renegotiate.As Labour\u0027s leader in Brussels and Strasbourg, Mr Corbett is believed to be influential on the party\u0027s European policy.Keir Starmer, the shadow EU exit secretary, recently said: Richard is one of our brilliant MEPs, he\u0026rsquos also effectively a member of my shadow team now. He comes to our shadow meetings and we\u0026rsquove had a really good relationship between the Parliamentary Labour Party here in the UK and Richard and the European Parliamentary Labour Party out in Brussels.I\u0026rsquom out in Brussels on a very regular basis working with Richard and his team and it\u0026rsquos been a really fantastic joint exercise."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/810690_1.jpg","title":"MCM Comic Con 2018 pictures cosplays cosplayers London excel centre","story":"Tens of thousands of comic book fans in elaborate costumes, known as cosplays, descended on the exhibition centre in Custom House, East London.The bi-annual event was held on the sweltering weekend of Friday May 25 to Sunday 27 as temperatures peaked at 26C to 27C.Marvel and Comic Book fans donned their favourite superhero personas such as Spider-Man, Deadpool, the Avengers and Superman to showcase their skills and cosplay craft.But the massive event was also home to gaming exhibitions, celebrity panel shows and hundreds of market stalls selling comic book memorabilia, art and other trinkets.

this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for good.The free-trading “global Britain” Mrs May has repeatedly made central to her vision of our future will be dead.Her entire Department for International Trade will be redundant.Incredibly, we would be inviting Brussels to run the trade policy of the world’s fifth biggest economy forever — even after we have supposedly “left” the EU.And we would have NO say in it.This is not the minor detail Remainers want you to believe. It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it. The insulting snub over the Galileo security system our taxpayers funded is the last straw.Toughen up now, Mrs May. Fight fire with fire. You have just two weeks to save Brexit and your Government with it.WHATEVER the Kremlin stooges on ­Labour’s front bench say, Russia is a ­murderous gangster state.It is now officially blamed by international investigators for the slaughter of 298 civilians on Flight MH17, blown from the sky over Ukraine in 2014.“All the vehicles in a convoy carrying the missile were part of the Russian armed forces,” says the report.Russia denies it, of course. Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home. It’s a start. But it’s not enough.Russia, as Boris Johnson rightly says, has a “disregard for innocent life” and “believes it can act with impunity”.And no wonder, when the cream of world football is about to help it showcase its hospitality for a month.It is shameful Russia was never stripped of the World Cup.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All we need now is to rediscover that global spirit.Mr Rees Mogg, who heads up a powerful bloc of Brexiteers, hit out: “Planning for no deal ought to be an essential part of the negotiations strategy.“To show we could easily walk away would worry the EU, strengthening our position and failing to do so would be both incompetent and weak.”And another Tory MP who serves as a government aide said they had been left “deeply unimpressed” by the attitude of the civil service.Last year Philip Hammond announced £3 billion of funds in his Autumn Budget to prepare for “every possible outcome” of Brexit.But critics say half of this cash will not be available until next 2019 - when Britain is due to leave.It comes as a fresh rift between Mr Hammond and the Bank of England opened over how close Britain stays to Brussels after Brexit.Insiders say relations between the Treasury and Old Lady of Threadneedle Street are “very, very bad”.The chancellor is reported to want to keep the City tied as closely as possible to the European rulebook, while the Bank fear the UK will simply become a “rule taker.”The best card we have to play in our negotiations with Brussels is that we can walk away if their hardline demands aren’t in our interests.That makes for a very strong hand.The EU would have a huge hole in its budget without our cash, and the Continent’s businesses will be livid if trading with the world’s sixth largest economy becomes more difficult.Yet if EU negotiators don’t take us seriously because we haven’t got regulators and standards bodies on standby if we do decide to go it alone, Brussels will serve us up nothing but thin gruel.And we’ll have no choice but to meekly surrender.The Prime Minister must ensure that Whitehall is prepared for Britain to go it alone. That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail. They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain.

Time for more elections and bigger votes.“If Italy gets another pro-EU appointee as Prime Minister expect real anger.”And Jacob Rees Mogg told The Sun the situation “tells you all you need to know about the European elites suspicion of democracy and desire to thwart voters who have been impoverished by the ideology of the EU.”Director of the Open Europe think tank Henry Newman said the country was now “rapidly descending into political chaos”.He warned: “Rather than respecting the democratic mandate of the League and Five Star Movement, the president is in danger of being seen to frustrate it.“The road ahead may be very busy for Italy but also for Europe as a whole. Rather than hearing the alarm bell and changing tack, all Europe’s political elites seem to be able to do is plough straight ahead even faster.”GOT a story?

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

Ten homes have come to meet and assess him and said ‘we can’t take him on’.“They all said no. It’s quite heartbreaking and so frustrating.“Me and my mum have no trust in the system whatsoever because it’s been so turbulent throughout the whole process.“He’s lived in Trafford all his life and it seems there’s nothing anyone can do for him.“For my dad it’s really upsetting. He’s in a confused state of mind - it’s just not acceptable.“Will we end up having to wait until he declines to the point where he’s more manageable?“We don’t want to hurry on the illness. This is not a permanent solution.”After being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s eight years ago, Michael - a former semi professional footballer - has been moved from pillar to post.At times Amy said he was “heavily sedated” and “isolated” because carers would increase his medication to make him easier to deal with.She added: “When he needs personal care and showering it can take up to four staff members because he doesn’t understand what is going on.“He started to get more agitated.“They increase his medication and he was very sedated.“Me and my mum said ‘this is not right’. He was just sleeping all the time.”In October Michael was moved to Shawe Lodge where he was “happy and settled”. But now the home closure - blamed on funding cuts - has left Michael back at “square one”.Trafford Council and Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said they have been dealing with rehoming residents affected by the closure.A spokesman said: “This has proved to be a difficult task as some of them have complex needs that cannot be accommodated in a regular nursing home.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”.

Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery.

I was saddened by the result in the Republic of Ireland. The Conservative backbencher said it should be up to Northern Ireland not Westminster whether it wants to follow the Republic.  He urged Mrs May to encourage all parties in Northern Ireland to restore devolved institutions including the Assembly, which has been suspended since January 2017.  This issue is really one of devolution, the North-East Somerset MP told LBC radio. This responsibility is devolved to Northern Ireland and if you respect our constitutional settlement then these issues ought to be decided in the right place. I\u0027m aware that the Assembly isn\u0027t currently sitting, but this is one of the reasons for encouraging Northern Irish politicians to bring their Assembly back together, so that they can settle these issues that are their responsibility. A caller into LBC asked the Tory whether Northern Ireland follow the Republic of Ireland and change its abortion laws.  Rees-Mogg said he was struck by comments made by DUP MP Jim Shannon who had claimed there are 100,000 people alive in Northern Ireland who would not be alive if it had the abortion laws the rest of the United Kingdom has.  The Tory MP is a staunch Roman Catholic who opposes abortion on a matter of principle. Labour\u0027s Baroness Chakrabarti said that the PM, as a self-identifying feminist, should legislate without delay to liberalise laws in Northern Ireland, where terminations are currently permitted only if a woman\u0027s life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health.  But Mr Rees-Mogg said Lady Chakrabarti was seeking to ignore a very important part of the constitution. I think once you start picking and choosing on the devolution settlement, you might find that you do great damage to the Union, he warned.  What if this was Scotland? What would be the result in Scotland if English MPs decided that they would overturn some policy of the SNP ? I think it\u0027s quite a dangerous approach to take in terms of our constitutional settlement.   In his regular LBC phone-in Rees-Mogg, who chairs the European Research Group of eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers, also took questions on Brexit .

But contrary to contemporary media versions, the most important thing about that moment was that any working class men left after the killing fields of the First World War were finally allowed to vote. Voting isn’t the only human right. But the test of feminists is whether they stick up for all women all over the world and not just women we meet at parties.  Women in Northern Ireland have been let down by privileged women and men for too long, the “democratic right” here is the right of women to make difficult ethical decisions about their bodies for themselves.

The year was 1971 and 25-year-old Dina had just been hospitalised following a mental breakdown. Over the previous weeks, Dina had been suffering with depression and delusions that she was an FBI target It had been a difficult few months for Dina. Originally from New York, she’d moved to England to work in a hospital, but she’d struggled to feel at home in Britain. She missed her family and friends dreadfully, and felt incredibly isolated, despite a serious relationship with her partner Yannis, a Greek journalist in exile. But mainly, she was working too hard, juggling lecturing in psychology, writing a book, seeing therapy clients and studying for a PhD. ‘One of my theories about having the breakdown is what I call too much work, not enough love,’ she says. ‘I knew I was slipping into a breakdown, I could feel it. My biggest fear was winding up in a back ward of some hospital, just having to watch TV all day.’  Her paranoid fantasies became stronger by the day. Dina was convinced she was an FBI target, and that some people were trying to poison her. The turning point came one day when she was walking through North London and had the sudden realisation she didn’t know what era she was in. ‘There was a fashion at that time for long dresses and also mini-skirts, and the contrast confused me – suddenly I couldn’t tell which century I was in. I stopped at a bakery to buy some biscuits but I wasn’t sure I had the right money because I didn’t know what the currency should be. It was a terrible confusion, and I walked home in the pouring rain. When I got home Yannis thought I looked completely drowned and warped, and that’s when he called the doctors to hospitalise me.’ But when Dina arrived at Middlesex Hospital, she felt certain the doctors were FBI agents trying to arrest her and fought them as much as she could. Eventually, they succeeded in admitting her to the psychiatric unit, where she would spend several months.  ‘I saw a note on the floor and in my mind it was a clue to follow,’ she recalls. ‘I was following all these “clues” and I got to the roof of the hospital and I thought, “I’m supposed to jump off.” But when I was imagining my body in bits on the ground, I couldn’t bear it so I ran the other way. I remember my heart beating very loudly, and when I got back to the ward the nurses took one look at me and realised they’d better keep an eye on me.’ Dina was sure she was going to die, and began to make preparations, even requesting to see the rabbi. ‘I felt completely hopeless, and just couldn’t see a future for myself,’ she explains. ‘Whatever breakdown you’re having, the tendency is to feel like you’re nothing and you’re no-one, especially if you can no longer do the things you used to do.’ The care she received was lacking in many ways, and Dina struggled with a lot of the staff at the hospital. But the patients formed a tight bond, and it was this camaraderie that made her begin to feel more human again. Some other patients began to confide in her about their problems, saying they trusted her opinion above those of their psychiatrists. ‘That was when I began to feel I was being valued, and realised I’m not just nothing – maybe I could come out of this and do some good by helping other people,’ she remembers. Turning point  After three months in hospital, Dina was ready to come home. ‘Slowly my mind began to understand things and see what was going on. It was a slow but happy process,’ she explains. ‘I felt great, like it was going to be spring forever because I wasn’t going to be in a mental hospital for the rest of my life.’ Piece by piece, Dina began to rebuild her life. She finished her PhD, got married and had two children, Ari and Chloe. The breakdown, in many ways, had been the first step to the rest of her life. ‘I always refer to that period as my “madness” as truly that is how I felt. It’s a word that’s so vivid and one that we fear so much,’ she says. ‘If you have the opportunity to come back in a positive way, which I did, you end up in a whole new place. That’s certainly true for me and I felt that having the breakdown was a positive experience.’ Dina channeled the energy from her new lease of life, penning a book to help others come back from the brink. She also co-founded a holiday company with Yannis, aimed at helping independent travellers have creative breaks where they can study things like art, writing, personal development or music in a beautiful setting. ‘I was inspired by the idea of community, in part the one I’d seen in hospital. I wanted to create that community atmosphere for my holiday makers with people they’d never met before, a safe place where people could open up and laugh more than they have since when they were a child.’ Positive change "},{"url":null,"title":"couples dream ford focus recalled","story":"NewsCouple\u0027s dream Ford Focus is recalled by car company - and ends up costing them thousandsAndy and Abi Middleham emptied their savings account to buy a used £7,700 Ford Focus 1.0-litre Ecoboost - and they planned to keep it for years\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRebecca SherdleyKelly-Ann Mills20:37, 28 MAY 2018Updated08:28, 29 MAY 2018NewsAndy Middleham\u0027s Ford Focus was recalled (Image: Nottinghamshire Live)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA husband and wife have been left with a bill for more than \u0026pound2,000 after Ford recalled their dream car. Andy and Abi Middleham emptied their savings account to buy a used \u0026pound7,700 Ford Focus 1.0-litre Ecoboost, which they planned to keep for years. In November the car\u0027s manufacturer recalled the six-year-old car as part of a nationwide review to replace a degas hose pipe from the coolant reservoir to the engine.  The car was returned but just three months later there appeared to be engine problems as black smoke began pouring from the exhaust, the Nottingham Post reports.  And the couple say this is when their nightmare really began.  Mr Middleham, a structural engineer from Gedling, booked the troubled motor into his local garage and the diagnosis was the replacement pipe had come loose and the engine had overheated. The garage wrote a letter to the Ford dealership, saying the recall work was not done properly, said Mr Middleham. But they didn\u0027t agree and offered only a 55% contribution, which left us with over \u0026pound2,300 to pay for their mistake. Their only response being that they are not obligated to make any kind of contribution as the vehicle is out of warranty. The distressed couple now have strong backing from their MP Vernon Coaker. The politician vowed: I am contacting Ford again to say this is totally unacceptable. My constituent is faced with a huge bill because of a design fault which Ford know about. There can be no ifs or buts about this – it should just be put right and customers should be reimbursed in full. People who buy their cars in good faith, and put their trust in the major manufacturers like Ford deserve better. Ford needs to change its policy now.  But Ford insists it has worked hard to keep customers informed and has a fast-track process to assess each case. A statement said contribution is on the basis of vehicle usage and service history, which can be the reason why there is not a consistent level of identical Ford support in every case. The full statement reads: In March 2015 Ford Focus 1.0-litre petrol owners were notified of a service action caused by the coolant hose potentially failing at high temperatures on cars built between October 2011 and October 2013. As a result of the service action, 86 per cent of affected vehicles have been reworked. Owners not covered by this notification experiencing a problem should visit a Ford dealer. If the cause is the same, Ford will contribute to costs on the basis of normal vehicle use, service record and any repair being carried out by Ford. But father-of-two Mr Middleham is unhappy with Ford\u0027s response, saying: Our vehicle was recalled as Ford have stated. The recall works were completed in November 2017 at their Sandicliffe Dealership. The engine still failed in February 2018 despite of this. Our car was at Sandicliffe Ford for nine weeks (the repair took seven weeks) and we were refused a courtesy car for the duration of that time. The couple have sought solace on a Facebook group, where other owners of the Ford Focus Ecoboost complain about not being fully compensated. Mr Middleham says there are almost 600 cars listed on the group page allegedly with similar problems. He feels his case is a particular injustice as the problem with his car was not of his making or wear and tear. The car was owned by the family for two years and had a full service history, said Mr Middleham.

Biking around with those massive backpacks looks like pretty hard work. But what do the riders themselves think about their job?  Cambridge News has spoken to a number of drivers in the city, after the food delivery company reported order grew by a massive 147 per cent in last year,  Here\u0027s the top 10 things the anonymous bikers want to say about their profession. 1. There\u0027s no better way to exercise for the cyclists If you\u0027re looking to get paid for a workout, and you\u0027re not a fan of the gym or exercising regularly - then there\u0027s not a better way to get fit. The mission to deliver someone\u0027s food takes over you, and before you know it, you\u0027ll have legs the size and power of nuclear bombs and a lung capacity of a whale. That\u0027s probably why there\u0027s so many of us. 2. A tip can go a long way Some of us are Deliveroo riders to earn extra cash in our spare time because, let\u0027s be honest, Cambridge is one of the most expensive places to live on planet Earth. When we travel across the city (especially in shocking conditions when we\u0027re most needed), we arrive to your plush home, be extra nice to you and leave you feeling nice and warm inside, and discover that we\u0027ve not been given a tip - it\u0027s soul-destroying. You can obviously choose to give a tip before we\u0027ve even arrived, so there\u0027s no guarantee you\u0027ll get perfect service. But it does go a long way. 3. Be more specific about your address This is mostly for people living in flats and student halls. The number of times when we\u0027ve not been able to get hold of you, not knowing which flat or halls of residence you\u0027re in, and as a consequence been stranded for ages while we lose time to deliver more orders to extend our time in this city, is enough to drive you mad. Please put your address in specifically. We don\u0027t get paid by the hour, we get paid per order.  4. I\u0027m not late, I\u0027ve only got around 10 deliveries to do before you Look mate, I\u0027m not late because I couldn\u0027t find your home, or that I\u0027m walking at a leisurely pace just because I want to annoy you. Sometimes we\u0027re given several orders to deliver at once, so you might be the last one. If we could get more orders done within the hour, we would absolutely try - that\u0027s more money for us, and quicker food for you. Everyone would be a winner. 5. We\u0027re not peasants This counts for a small minority of people, but you do sometimes get spoken to with a patronising and demanding tone, like because we\u0027re a service that you\u0027ve paid for - we somehow deserve to be treated like we\u0027re the brunt of society. When we\u0027re not able to find your flat, for example, please assume it\u0027s because you\u0027ve not been specific about where you live, rather than assume because we deliver food we\u0027re not educated enough to navigate Google Maps. It\u0027s not like we use it for our entire shift, or anything. And another thing, some of us have other jobs. So we might be more educated than you.  6. We\u0027ve judged you slightly if you live next to the restaurant I don\u0027t buy the cynicism about Deliveroo users. Some think it\u0027s for lazy people. The reality is there will be times when you really can\u0027t cook and/or travel for ingredients or meals. It\u0027s a great solution to that. But then there are times when you\u0027re totally miffed. I received an order from someone who wanted a Nando\u0027s recently, and arrived outside their home to find that it was directly across the road to it. You\u0027ve been totally judged, mate. 7. Getting an order for us is sometimes like the holy grail The Deliveroo rider app works according to supply and demand. We wait in a location to be notified that an order is ready for us. We choose to accept or reject it. In busy periods (which tend to be cold evenings), we\u0027re sorted. We\u0027ll get so many orders, and will work as long as we can to try and fit in at least three orders per hour. But when it\u0027s warm and every Deliveroo cyclist is out - we\u0027ll all be thirsty for orders. So when we arrive to your location and we\u0027re super happy, it\u0027s because you\u0027ve quenched us.

But it seems that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have been making plans for a romantic break in one of the most spectacular places on Earth. The newly-wed pair are believed to be headed for the Canadian Rockies, specifically Jasper National Park in the heart of the province of Alberta. According to TMZ, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be staying in a secluded log cabin at Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, a sprawling resort set in pristine wilderness.  Their home-from-home will be the 6,000sqft Outlook Cabin dubbed The Royal Retreat as it has hosted a number of other royal guests including the current Queen and Prince Philip in 2005 and her parents in 1939.  Jasper Park Lodge is set on the shores of Lac Beauvert and has a vast golf course which has been rated the best in Canada. The couple are likely to be protected by Canadian and British security. Sources told TMZ that the 700-acre resort had ordered in specialist gear it normally does not keep on site.  Jasper is a UNESCO World Heritage site reknown for its abundant wildlife including grizzly, black bears, mountain caribou, elk, moose and wolves.   Details emerged about their honeymoon after more information came out about Prince William\u0027s speech. One of the guests told the Sunday Times the second in line to the throne made a filthy joke about wet knickers. Unfortunately details of the joke haven\u0027t been leaked - but we really hope we find out at some point! William also pulled a prank on his little brother at the party, and nearly floored some of the guests in the process.  Apparently Harry recently fell off a ladder while trying to change a lightbulb, so Wills tied a ladder to the back of the newlyweds\u0027 car. Harry\u0027s pal Charlie van Straubenzee also spoke, mocking the prince for his ginger hair. According to the Times, he questioned Harry\u0027s behaviour when he was acting as dorm monitor at Ludgrove School in Berkshire, where they were both students. He said: All I wanted was a cuddle from my mummy. Instead Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out on to the roof. Ladies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined?  The bride and groom also made speeches during the evening reception at Frogmore House in Windsor Castle. Harry reportedly moved guests to tears as he gushed over his new wife and paid tribute to her mum Doria. Meghan read an emotional love poem and declared she had finally found her prince.

The 24-year-old booked an Uber to her boyfriend’s house in Heswall, Wirral, at about 1.30am but was astounded when she saw the receipt in her emails the next morning.

A Rolls-Royce Phantom IV took the new Duchess of Sussex and her mum Doria Ragland to St George\u0027s Chapel for the stunning ceremony.  It\u0027s the same vehicle which took Wallis Simpson to the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Windsor, in 1972. Both Meghan and Mrs Simpson are American divorcees although the 36-year-old\u0027s marriage into the royal family has not caused a crisis at the very highest levels of government.  In 1936 King Edward VIII, the Queen\u0027s uncle, made clear he intended to marry Mrs Simpson - something which parliament would not approve. And so he abdicated, reigning for just 326 days, one of the shortest in British history. His younger brother George VI took over the throne and following his death in 1952 then-Princess Elizabeth became Queen.

Caroline Sutton, 38, spent three weeks in an induced coma after a clot caused damage to around a quarter of her brain on the left side. Now, she is only able to say four, four, four over and over again. The former mental health nurse, from Atherton, Greater Manchester, underwent the operation to treat a brain aneurysm in February.  The procedure, known as an endovascular aneurysm coiling procedure, carries just a 2% risk of complication, the Manchester Evening News reports.  Caroline, who has two young sons, George and Max, had undergone the same successful procedure, to treat a different artery, 10 years earlier.  She was reportedly told by doctors at The Walton Centre in Liverpool that she should be home a couple of days after the surgery. However, a clot formed during the treatment, damaging part of her brain. The severe swelling was crushing her brain, meaning surgeons needed to perform a craniectomy, to remove a quarter of her skull to prevent further damage. The effect was catastrophic. Caroline’s husband, Chris, was warned by doctors his wife may die. There is no suggestion medics were at fault. Caroline was just tragically unlucky. “I will never forget what the surgeon said to me at the time,” Chris said. “He said it was very difficult to be optimistic about Caroline’s recovery and that the next 72 hours would be critical.  “I remember going home to tell the kids. It was one of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had to have. “My eldest asked me if his mum was going to die and I had to say I didn’t know. It’s been very difficult.” Caroline was in an induced coma for three weeks, had two bouts of pneumonia, and experienced delirium following her surgery. But the mum, originally from Warrington, did manage to survive and is now in the process of rehabilitation at Trafford General Hospital. As well as severe mobility and cognitive problems, she requires daily speech and language therapy, and is currently only able to repeat the word ‘four’. Caroline’s friends and family are now fighting for the intense level of daily therapy they say she needs if she is going speak coherently again. Her loved ones have reportedly been told she will need at least two years of inpatient rehabilitation.  Like many services, funding for speech and language therapy has been slashed in recent years, meaning Caroline is only getting two therapy sessions a week in hospital. It is against NHS rules for patients to be treated by a private therapist as an NHS patient. “It does feel like a daily battle to get the therapy Caroline needs,” said Chris, who has enlisted the help of his local MPs to help with his cause. “There are no guarantees about her recovery.

As sunbathers relaxed on one beach yesterday, a base-jumper leapt from the clifftops 150ft above them. Emergency crews were called to a hotel after guests sparked a fire scare with a barbecue on their balcony. And as parts of the country bathed in temperatures of nearly 27C, torrential downpours caused flash floods and tragedy elsewhere. Beachgoers in West Bay, Dorset, were said to have looked on in shock as a young man, wearing an orange crash helmet, jumped from the sandstone cliffs at around 1.50pm. A second, older man was stood with him at the top before the jump and held his parachute before letting go.

Sarah Boyton, 51, wasn\u0027t surprised when she was diagnosed with skin cancer as she\u0027d spent her entire life using sunbeds and not protecting her skin in the sun.  But despite having the cancer removed – leaving behind a 5cm scar under her eye - Sarah is continuing to top up her sun tan.  Sarah claims she’s addicted to tanning her skin and it’s her laid back nature that’s to blame for her inability to stop lying in the sun.  She has made some changes since her diagnosis though as she now always ensures she wears factor 10 sun cream while sunbathing.  The cafe owner said: I love lying in the sun, the feeling of the warmth on my skin, I know I shouldn\u0027t go out in it but I can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027m addicted to being brown and I\u0027ll stop at no lengths to ensure I have a natural glow. I grew up never wearing sun cream and I even had a sunbed in my house so I could go on it whenever I fancied topping up my tan. I do now wear sun cream but at the most it\u0027ll be factor 10 and by the end of my holiday I\u0027ll swap to oil. Despite this I have warned my friends and family about the dangers of the sun after my own skin cancer diagnosis. A lot of my friends always used the sunbeds but after my ordeal and seeing my scars they\u0027ve stopped.  Sarah was first diagnosed with skin cancer during October 2016 and has continued to go on two sunny holidays each year. She added: To remove the cancer from my face I needed two operations after the first didn\u0027t get all of the cancer. I\u0027m really pleased with the scar now, the surgeon was amazing, it almost looks like I\u0027ve had a face lift. “I have been warned by doctors to stay out of the sun and to wear total sun block but I can’t help myself. Sarah - who lost her son, Jack, 17, in a car crash five years ago - has admitted she doesn\u0027t take life too seriously after losing her only son. She added: I warn others about the dangers but I don\u0027t really take my own advice as I still go in the sun.

Jess Coleman was left with a gaping wound in her forehead after getting caught in the crossfire in a bar brawl, reports the Huddersfield Examiner .  She had only been in Five Bar, in Huddersfield town centre, for 20 minutes when a man walked in off the street and attacked a man who was with two women nearby. He then lifted a glass from an overhead rack at the bar and launched it across the room, but it missed his intended victim - and hit Jess in the face. She said: “One of the women threw a drink and it splashed me so I grabbed a napkin from the bar and looked down to clean it off my arm.  “Then I could tell a glass hit my head. I think I was just in his path. “I looked down again and saw the blood pouring down. I couldn’t see out my left eye because there was so much blood. “I fainted. I think it was from the shock. “The bouncer picked me up and took me upstairs to a first aider.” Jess, who is from Liversedge, had travelled into town with two of her friends and went to the Slug and Lettuce and Revolution first. She said she had little to drink and is lucky she has a good memory of the incident. A spokesperson for Five Bar said: “We have done everything right that we could have done and we’re devastated, but it’s just the nature of the beast. “The incident was captured on five HD cameras and we’ve handed all the CCTV to the police.” West Yorkshire Police confirmed there is an ongoing investigation, but were unable to provide further details.  The Mirfield Free Grammar student, who is in the middle of doing her A Level exams, said: “If I hadn\u0027t looked down at my arm to dry it off, it could have been my eye or the back of my head [that was hit] and it could have killed me.” A bouncer rushed her upstairs where she received first aid and emergency services were called, but the ambulances were too busy and her parents had to come to the bar and take her to hospital, where the cut was glued. Jess, who is due to start studying an events management degree at Leeds Beckett University in September, said: I think the bar staff should have [tackled the fight] sooner when it was getting rowdy, but I think they handled the situation with me well. “The bouncer should have taken him outside, rather than further in towards the bar which was nearer the glasses.” The culprit was described as black, around six feet tall and wearing a white shirt.  Jess’s sister Becky posted an appeal to identify him on Facebook and it was shared more than 800 times.  Jess said: “It’s not what I wanted when I’d just turned 18 and has knocked my confidence a bit.

Forecasters have issued a yellow warning for rain across southern England following a scorching Bank Holiday weekend. Humid air is likely to cause an outbreak of thunderstorms which threaten to dump around 30mm of rain in an hour or less in some places. The Met Office has warned flooding, lightning strikes or gusty winds could lead to power cuts or loss of other services, and travel disruption.  Temperatures will remain in the low to mid 20s, with most of Britain staying warm and dry. The worst storms are expected in the south of England, where a yellow warning is in place from Cornwall to Suffolk until at least 10pm on Tuesday. The Met Office said: Some places will probably stay dry or at least miss the worst of the showers.    However, the humid air across parts of southern UK may again encourage further outbreaks of thundery activity. Where this happens up to around 30 mm could fall in an hour or less, with flooding a possibility. It warned: There is a small chance that homes and businesses could be flooded or struck by lighting, causing damage to some buildings.  Where flooding occurs, there is a slight chance of delays or cancellations to train and bus services. Spray and flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures. There is a slight chance that flooding or lightning strikes could cause power cuts and loss of other services to some homes and businesses.  The Environment Agency has warned people not to drive through floodwater, reminding people that just 30cm can move a car as dozens of flood alerts continued on Tuesday. The day is expected to bring a mix of sun and cloud with temperatures in the low to mid 20s across much of England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Temperatures will likely peak in the mid to high teens in northern England and Scotland.  Humid weather spawned a series of thunderstorms with spectacular lightning displays and heavy rain over the Bank Holiday weekend. The UK\u0027s hottest place on Monday was Cavendish, Suffolk, where the temperature soared to 27.3C as the bank holiday weekend came to a close. Scotland and Northern Ireland both had their warmest day of the year so far with 27.1C in Dunstaffnage and 25.1C at Castlederg.

Drill videos easily able to view online feature hooded and masked gangs threatening each other with violent lyrics, gestures and hand signals, with some attracting millions of views. The Met has built up a database of more than 1,400 videos to use as an intelligence tool as the force tries to tackle an increase in killings and other violent crime, with more than 60 murder investigations launched already this year.  In the past two years Scotland Yard has asked YouTube to take down between 50 and 60 music videos, having to prove they incite violence for the requests to be successful. The video-sharing site, owned by Google, has removed more than 30 of the clips from the platform - or just over half - in cases where they were found to be in violation of its policies. YouTube said the majority of the videos flagged up by the Met are no longer available on its platform and the company has developed policies to tackle videos related to knife crime. Some of the drill music videos still available online feature groups associated with the post code war linked to the murder of Tanesha Melbourne, 17, who was shot dead in Tottenham last month. It is not known whether the Met has asked YouTube to remove them.  Detective Superintendent Mike West said the force has been monitoring the increase in the number of videos that incite violence since September 2015. The gangs try to outrival each other with the filming and content - what looks like a music video can actually contain explicit language with gangs threatening each other, he said. There are gestures of violence, with hand signals suggesting they are firing weapons and graphic descriptions of what they would do to each other. The Met has got a central database of more than 1,400 indexed videos that we assess and use to gather intelligence. DS West said the force only asks for videos which we believe raise the risk of violence to be removed. He added: Closer partnership work with Google has been developed in the past few months, in order to evolve and increase our capacity to remove social media videos that incite violence, as quickly as possible. Pressplay, a company that promotes drill music videos, said on its Instagram page that police had forced YouTube to take some clips down because of what\u0027s happened lately.

Among the unusual never-before-seen species shown in video footage is a \u0027ratfish\u0027 which has big ears and - despite having eyes - is blind, said to use a lateral line to sense the change of current. Later in the clip, a group of bright red deep sea shrimps move together across the illuminated and baited drone area and a cutthroat eel attempts to rip the meat away. The species live in seamounts - ridges caused by underwater \u0027mountains\u0027 - as deep down as 5,000 metres below the ocean\u0027s surface in dark and cold climates.  China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association chief scientist Wang Chunsheng said the creatures were filmed using a remotely-operated drone.

My first one was about Banana being very serious but Orange wanting to have a party.Banana was furious when he came home and Orange had all the fruit and vegetables over for a party.Orange had to say sorry.I also did all the drawings for my book and my Grandad Kelly said it was brilliant.My school is Newport Primary and I am very lucky to have great friends – Zerah, Eva, Darcey, Ava-Ruth and all my classmates.They love getting to hear my stories at homework sharing time every week.Just now, I am writing stories about my class. I put jokes in too.Sometimes people don’t laugh but my mum/editor says this happens all the time, even to comedians, so I shouldn’t let it bother me.My first class story was about how we were all kidnapped and there were no teachers around so the pupils saved the day.My second story was about how we lost someone and I found him and saved the day.In my third story, we were all locked in and had to be saved by the primary ones.My next story will be called “Chaotic Classroom”. I think you know what happens there!I have been inspired by lots of different people including Pamela Butchart, Roald Dahl, my brother Conor, who is 10, David Walliams and my classmates.My dad always shows me comics and tells me all about the Marvel Universe. I love these films.Even though I am only writing small stories, the good thing is that I’m learning all the time.Even great authors make mistakes and all you have to do is fix them.When I am older and have written some books, I hope you will read one of them.I had a great time telling you all about my love of writing.Thank you for reading my column. I hope you enjoyed it.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Next-Up-Festival.jpg ","title":"dundee people pupils bring their own production to the stage","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils from the High School of Dundee have come together to create and perform their own piece of original drama.Following intensive rehearsals earlier this month, a 12-strong group of F3 and F6 pupils brought their production, ‘Secrets’, to Dundee Rep’s main stage as part of the Next Up Festival, which was a celebration of the work of young theatre-makers in the North East of Scotland.F6 pupil Sam Marshall explained, \u0026#8220We as young people are increasingly concerned with our Mental Health and Wellbeing, so we wanted to create a piece of drama which recognises that it is out there and is our secret enemy.\u0026#8221As part of the festival, the pupils also took part in a series of workshops, before giving a public performance of their piece, which used Verbatim Theatre and was inspired by the work of Frantic Assembly, on Saturday evening.For more about the Next Up Festival, go to: http://www.dundeerep/article/next-up-festival\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Biggest_Weekend_Noel_Gallagher_Performance-14_25805678.jpg ","title":"dundee people trying to find can you help dundonian david find the girl from the festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDo you know the girl from Longforgan with ginger hair and blue eyes and is originally from Northern Ireland?

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"professional dog walker calls foul as 26 bags of poo collected on popular playing fields","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDog owners who allow their pets to foul a popular area in Monifieth have come under fire.Professional dog walker Andrea Penny, 31, was told about the mess at the town’s football pitches by a friend and decided to do her bit to help.She collected 26 bags of dog poo in one visit.Andrea said: “Someone mentioned to me that there was quite a lot of mess.“It’s quite a busy area.

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham

cross-funding arrangement was introduced six years ago and has ultimately left Highland Council baffled, according to its leader Margaret Davidson.In discussions about a review of the \"partnership arrangements\" for providing integrated health and social care, she told colleagues: \"We need to have better governance around the finance. I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

ballboy to dons legendneale cooper the local hero who won it all with the reds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAn outstanding talent who progressed through the Pittodrie youth ranks to conquer Europe and score an iconic goal in a Scottish Cup final.Just a few of the many happy memories Willie Miller has of his fellow Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper who was at the heart of the midfield of a Dons side that dominated not just Scotland, but Europe.Aberdeen-raised and a lifelong Dons fan, Neale had been a ballboy as a kid at the club he adored.His dream of playing for the Reds did not just come true – he went on to become one of the club’s greatest ever home-grown talents.For Willie, the European Cup Winners’ Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich in Germany showed the world how big a talent Neale was.Aberdeen drew 0-0 in Munich’s Olympic Stadium in the first leg before winning the second leg 3-2 in arguably Pittodrie’s greatest ever night.Sir Alex Ferguson had tasked Neale with keeping Bayern’s star man Paul Breitner, World Cup winner in 1974 and beaten World Cup finalist only a year earlier, in check.He eliminated the threat of Breitner, the Ballon d’Or runner-up just 18 months earlier, with a masterful midfield display.Willie said: “We lifted a lot of trophies together and also the European Cup Winners’ Cup in Gothenburg.“One game I really remember is against Bayern Munich in Germany.“Neale was absolutely outstanding in that 0-0 draw which was so important on the road to getting to that European final.“He also scored that memorable goal against Rangers in the 4-1 Scottish Cup final win (in 1982).”Prior to the first leg against Bayern, legendary West German international Franz Beckenbauer spied on the Dons. He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/EE3_0020.jpg-847x564.jpg ","title":"7000 of designer clothing donated to two aberdeen charity

of Shelter Scotland’s Aberdeen branches ere left stunned by the anonymous donation of the new high-end designer menswear and womenswear.The Union Street store received 60 pairs of trousers and six coats and jackets by trendy labels such as Junk de Luxe, William Hunt, YMC and Elvis Jesus.Staff at Shelter estimated that each individual item, based on retail websites, could cost £100 and some considerably more.They said a conservative estimation of the total value is around £7,000.Manager of the Union Street store Jill Cooper said: “We can’t thank donors enough – whether they’re giving us luxury labels or everyday items they no longer need – it all helps us to make sure we can provide services and keep up our campaign going until there is a home for everyone.”Shelter’s George Street store did not miss out on the bumper donation, as they accepted a contribution of a Vivienne Westhood coat, Louboutin shoes and T-shirts by True Religion.The trainers, which were made in Italy, come complete with the brand’s iconic red sole.Manager of the George Street store Wendy McEwan was delighted with the extravagant donations, most of which came from one customer.She said: “It happens now and again that we get designer clothes donated and it provides customers with a great chance to buy them at a discounted price.“We do see a lot of unusual things in this job and you never know what you’re getting.“I’m not a fashion expert – I prefer casual clothes myself – but I recognise the names and know what looks good.“I think these clothes would suit any young and trendy male.“We are a busy store and this is a great way to kick off our anniversary celebrations.”Shelter Scotland helps more than half a million people every year across the country struggling with bad housing or homelessness through their advice, support and legal services.Jill added: “It’s Shelter Scotland’s 50th year and we are still fighting to make sure no one faces bad housing and homelessness alone.“It’s vital that we keep money coming in through our shops which are at the heart of our community.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/59e5aebf3e38d-848x564.jpg ","title":"colourful mural to reflect history of popular

I only hope they had had a better offer that evening and they weren’t caught up in some Agatha Christie drama of their own.I shopped locally.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club.

South Ayrshire Depute Provost William Grant and MP Bill Grant popped along to a showcase of Maybole’s Over Fifties group’s various activities and were pleased with the ongoing contribution to the community. Chairman of the club Peter Mason said: “I am very proud that we now have over 100 members. “In the two years since the group started many things have happened, many new friendships have been formed and many new skills learned. “These groups are going from strength to strength, and I would like to thank the group leaders for all the hard work they put into their groups week on week and also to the members who come along to support each group.” The group meet on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, mostly at The Speakers, 8-10 Whitehall, on Maybole High Street.  From health and fitness classes like yoga and keep fit, sewing and a Knit and Natter class and even the opportunity to learn a new language with Spanish and German classes – there’s lots to do and new skills to achieve. Chairman Peter hopes more clubs can be formed to cater for even more members. He added: “For the future I hope to see some more new groups starting especially for male members as I am conscious that we do not have a lot to offer to them. “If we can retain our successes for another year, we will go from strength to strength and I hope each and every one of you will join me on that journey.” ● For more information of what activities are on offer, visit the website at www.mayboleover50s.org or contact club secretary Anne Walker on 07846 180753.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.
