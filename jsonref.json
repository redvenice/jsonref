She talks about hidden trauma, ‘horrible’ language – and what the Covid crisis has revealedIn 2016, Elizabeth Price curated an ethereal, elusive exhibition called In a Dream You Found a Way to Survive and You Were Full of Joy. She chose work that was particular to her, close to her heart. On one level, it was about the idea of the horizontal. It was full of recumbent sculptures, queues, processions, dances, snowdrifts, ribbons, and flags. At the same time, it was infused with thoughts of sleep, dreams and death.“I was drawing on connections I’d been putting together over years and years, things that had been formative,” says the artist. “It was a view of what art can be, or what my relationship with art is.” Her latest exhibition, by contrast, has at its heart the idea of the vertical. For Slow Dans, a trilogy of multiscreen video works, she flipped the projector. Visitors to the large 19th-century assembly hall in which the show unfolds will see works on long, thin screens, 3 metres tall by 1.5 metres wide.“It was a simple reorganisation, the coordinates changing,” she says of Slow Dans, which was first seen in Manchester last year and now comes to London. But this flipping allowed her to “express the idea of depth, and shafts, and wells”. In these short but dense works – whose complex editing process she likens to lace-making (“holding 17, or 117, threads in place”) – she plays with objects and artefacts that are also long, thin and vertical: ties, pens, stiletto heels, gowns.Out of this melee emerges a trio of stories that have a funny, haunting tale to tell about labour and the world of work, about women’s place in that world, about the way society and technology have changed in Price’s own lifetime. (She is now 53.) It is a signature Price combination: formal ideas mingled with painstaking research, all transmuted into poetry by means of a fierce and rigorous imagination.We are speaking – at a judicious distance – in Price’s studio, a glassy flat in south London. For five weeks in the spring, she was ill with suspected Covid-19: one week properly ill, four weeks of “boring and exasperating” recuperation. Since recovering, she’s been working here in isolation. Without her studio assistant, “it all got a bit feral”. She’s done some tidying up, but the place is still littered with intriguing objects. On a table is a selection of mannequin legs – shop props for hosiery – that, en masse, have a dismembered creepiness. She doesn’t know how she’ll use them yet, maybe in some future artwork, but she has an eye for collecting “things of low value for which there is little recorded history”, things that speak of their time in some eloquent but unremarked way.This paraphernalia seems more reminiscent of a sculptor’s studio than a film-maker’s. But it is a reminder that Price worked in sculpture before starting to make video in her 40s, and still considers it her “disciplinary home – where all the best jokes are, the place in art school where all the shifting, awkward stuff goes”. She also had a brief but brilliant career in the late-1980s as the vocalist of indie-pop band Talulah Gosh, and worked in various administrative roles for London councils.In 2012, six years after she’d made her first video, Price won the Turner prize. When I interviewed her the day after, she said she had felt “very grave and unelated, and serious, and focused” receiving the award, which I think is a state of being for Price, who speaks with precision and a kind of detachment about her work that does not quite express its emotional force. She does, however, also have a well-chiselled sense of the ridiculous, and her videos can hum with humour.There are no jokes in the first of the trilogy, though. Kohl, which unfolds over four screens, takes as its material an extraordinary archive of photographs of coal-mining headgear, shot by a former pit worker in the 80s and 90s. While the surface-level signs of these structures have all but disappeared, the mines – “complex webs of subterranean architecture” – are still there. On a research trip to Wakefield’s National Coal Mining Museum, one former miner told her that the tunnels were so extensive you could walk all the way from Newcastle to Nottingham underground.Then another former miner told her, of course you couldn’t: mines would have been full of groundwater unless it was constantly pumped out, and “if you connected up all the coal mines, you would make this massive, surging, terrifying place of tides”. That gave her the nub of her ghostly little story, in which there’s a sense of a suppressed memory threatening to inundate us, “the rising-up of this liquid, like a symptom of a trauma from an injury long forgotten”. She relates it to how “inky spit”, as it was known, was the first “tell” of miners’ lung disease, another symptom rising up unbidden.Inkiness pervades the trilogy. The second video work, Felt Tip, weaves a subversive and hilarious fiction about the wearing of ties (items that are arranged into a nib-like V-shape) and the use of pens in offices. It is seen on two stacked vertical screens, reaching a height of nearly 6 metres – the perfect skinny format for its material.We see many ties in the video: Price has amassed, over 15 years, quite the collection. Dating from the mid-70s to the mid-80s, hers all have in common the imagery of computer technology – little squares or stripes or dotted lines that recall computer chips, or circuit boards. She remembers the first one she spotted, in a charity shop, with its chip-like design “in the place usually reserved for a crest. So that an image associated with the capacity of computers to store data had supplanted a memory of social provenance.”Felt Tip is narrated by a sometimes sardonic voice, one that seems to be confiding the secrets of a bored but intelligent female administrative cadre. An inspiration for the video was a book Price found in a charity shop, Sexuality and Class Struggle by Reimut Reiche, from 1968. It wasn’t the book itself – “well-researched, of its time” – that was intriguing. It was the annotations by a previous reader in purple felt-tip, “which seemed the most vulgar addition to this discourse, deliberately belligerent, and using the most trivial or feminised pen, big and fat and fleshy”.These sarcastic marginalia, full of exclamation marks and underlinings, were, she was certain, the work of a woman. “I’m interested in the radical impact of the postscript or addendum changing everything after the fact,” she says. “The interventions in that book altered it, rewrote it, and also resuscitated it, putting it to different use.” The voice of Price’s video is like that insistent wielder of the purple felt-tip – undermining an official view of patriarchal history with subversive and creative footnotes.In one sense, Price says, the story of her three videos is that “one is about manual work, one is about administrative work and one is about executive work”. These days, Price is a professor at Kingston University in London, and the third narrative of the trilogy, The Teachers, is a kind of science fiction tale: we hear various theories as to why a contagion of silence has crept through the professions, starting with university teachers.The idea is that at a certain point these executives have simply declined to speak, refusing – perhaps – to continue to use the ungainly language that corporate culture expects them employ. Instead, they begin to communicate through their bodies – through a series of gestures and wordless noises, through eloquent flicks of their dresses and gowns, which are beautifully evoked on the screen. Price is exasperated at this corporatisation of the language of academia. “The way it describes its processes and objectives is so horrible, and the only way to achieve anything in academia is to attempt to speak the language, so you talk about ‘outcomes’ and so on. You use this loathsome terminology. It’s the only way you can get resources for your students, so you parlay.”Slow Dans should have opened in May. A lot has happened since then, and I wonder how she feels its concerns will be read in the era of Covid-19. “We’ll have to see,” she says. “I guess all kinds of political consequences have come home in the crisis: impacts of austerity, the privatisation of the NHS. Others have become more visible, but are longstanding, deeper, like the impacts of structural racism, meaning the epidemic is more dangerous to some of us than others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ddcb77cfec3daa91ecedf50ac652b795a233c5/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5b9147500205a79fde6eacd53eb622ba","title":"wish it was a coming out older gay people in italy in pictures","story":"Photographer Melissa Ianniello’s long-term project investigates the double taboos of homosexuality and old age in Italy.

Since then, however, it has recovered to trade at pre-pandemic levels.Morten Lund, an analyst at Nordea Markets, told Reuters that “general risk sentiment” and a weaker dollar had helped sterling.Francesco Pesole, a foreign exchange strategist at ING, warned that the pound’s rise might show that investors are underpricing the risk of a no-deal Brexit. He said: GBP positioning is a good indication of how investors are currently keeping a highly complacent approach to the Brexit story. While the collapse of Brexit negotiations late last week will only be mirrored in next week’s CFTC positioning report – and we may see the rebuild of some GBP shorts – sterling’s positioning is still far from the levels it hovered around when markets were pricing in a no-deal Brexit. In our view, this continues to highlight how GBP is underpricing the risk of a no-deal outcome of current UK-EU trade negotiations, which in turn flags a non-negligible risk of more stress being built into sterling in the coming weeks.

The company said multiple offers were on the table for parts of the business but buyers did not want to acquire all the existing sites and 91 of its 250 outlets would remain permanently closed.Arcadia – 500 jobs1 July: Arcadia, Sir Philip Green’s troubled fashion group – which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Burton, Evans and Wallis – said in July 500 head office jobs out of 2,500 would go in the coming weeks.SSP Group – 5,000 jobs1 July: The owner of Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza is to axe 5,000 jobs, about half of its workforce, with cuts at its head office and across its UK operations after the pandemic stalled domestic and international travel.Harrods – 700 jobs1 July: The department store group is\u0026nbspcutting one in seven of its 4,800 employees because of the “ongoing impacts” of the pandemic.Harveys – 240 jobs30 June: Administrators made\u0026nbsp240 redundancies at the furniture chain Harveys, with more than 1,300 jobs at risk if a buyer cannot be found.TM Lewin – 600 jobs30 June: Shirtmaker TM Lewin\u0026nbspclosed all 66 of its outlets permanently, with the loss of about 600 jobs.Monsoon Accessorize – 545 jobs11 June: The fashion brands were\u0026nbspbought out of administration by their founder, Peter Simon, in June, in a deal in which 35 stores closed permanently and 545 jobs were lost.The Restaurant Group – 3,000 jobs3 June: The owner of dining chains such as Wagamama and Frankie \u0026amp Benny’s has closed most branches of Chiquito and all 11 of its Food \u0026amp Fuel pubs, with another 120 restaurants to close permanently.

That has helped to support spending, but employers are now obliged to contribute to payments for workers, and the scheme will stop entirely at the end of October, raising concerns about a wave of job losses in the meantime. Among the other distributive trades surveyed, the CBI said that: Retail employment fell at the fastest rate since February 2009 in the year to August, with an even sharper decline anticipated in the year to September as the pandemic prompts a wave of redundancies, according to a survey of major retailers.The furlough scheme has proved effective at insulating workers and businesses in some of the worst-hit sectors during the pandemic, but these findings reinforce fears that many job losses have been delayed rather that avoided. Indeed, the latest survey shows that trading conditions for the retail sector remain tough, even against the backdrop of business slowly returning. Firms will be wary of deteriorating household incomes and the risk of further local lockdowns potentially hitting them in the pocket for a second time. So how much will Ant Group be worth?The company was started by Alibaba founder Jack Ma and has a dominant position in China’s financial services industry. Ant Group was previously known as Ant Financial. It was established in 2014 and grew out of Ma’s Alipay, an escrow payments service started by Alibaba in 2004 to serve shoppers and merchants on Taobao, one of the world’s largest e-commerce sites (and also owned by Alibaba). It is still in the very early stages of the to-and-fro over the valuation of the company, but some reports suggest it could aim to rival Paypal, which is currently valued at $233bn (£178bn).The Financial Times (£) in July reported that Ant Group was last valued at $150bn in mid-2018 after raising around $14bn from investors including Temasek, General Atlantic, Warburg Pincus and Baillie Gifford. The IPO prospectus suggests that the company could be vulnerable to trade tensions between the US and China. Donald Trump has certainly proven himself to be very interested in the fortunes of Chinese tech companies, with TikTok under pressure.Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech arm and China’s dominant mobile payments firm, has filed for a dual stock market listing in Hong Kong and on Shanghai’s Nasdaq-style STAR Market.The initial public offering could raise as much as $30bn (£23bn) which would make it the largest ever, Reuters reported.Ant, already the world’s most valuable unicorn - or billion-dollar unlisted tech firm - did not disclose the size, timetable or other key details of the offering in its preliminary prospectus.Consumers spending more on their homes compared with other sectors, and pent up demand following lockdown have helped push homeware retailer DFS Furniture’s trading beyond the firm’s expectations.The retailer said in a trading update that its financial year had “started strongly”, with year-on-year order intake growth over the past six weeks equivalent to about £70m of revenues.More info on that AstraZeneca trial: the pharmaceutical group has started a clinical trial of a drug to help prevent and treat Covid-19, with the first volunteers already receiving doses.The company, which is separately developing a potential Covid-19 vaccine together with scientists at Oxford University, said the drug, known as AZD7442, is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies.AstraZeneca said the trial, which will include up to 48 healthy volunteers in the UK aged 18 to 55, will be focused on safety, and the body’s reaction to the drug and how it processes it.You can read the full report here:Newsflash: The Co-operative Bank is set to cut 350 jobs and cut 18 branches.It’s blaming low interest rates, economic uncertainty and the shift away from banking in high street branches in favour of digital banking.  Andrew Bester, the Co-op Bank’s chief executive, said:Our people have shown great dedication and commitment to our customers over the past few months, so we are very sorry to announce this news today. Unfortunately, we’re not immune to the impact of recent events, with the historically low base rate affecting the income of all banks and a period of prolonged economic uncertainty ahead, which means it’s important we reduce costs and have the right-sized operating model in place for the future.At the same time, we are responding to the continuing shift of more and more customers choosing to bank online, with lower levels of transactions in branches, a trend which has been increasing for some time, across the banking sector and more broadly. We knew that a recovery from the April nadir was coming, but economists are intently studying early indicators for signs of how fast activity will come back. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said Ifo’s business climate indicator is “slightly less upbeat” than the headline improvement suggested. He said:As with the PMIs, however, the key test in the next few months will be whether it stabilises at its current level, having already rebounded significantly. If it does, it will indicate the recovery is ongoing. Overall, these data only really confirm what we already know, namely that economic activity is now recovering after having collapsed during lockdown. We know from the hard data that the rebound was very strong in the latter part of the second quarter, but it is now almost surely easing, though survey data remain consistent with decent data through July and August. And remember, German’s economy was already relatively weak even before the pandemic, flirting with recession in recent years. Here is quarter-on-quarter GDP since the third quarter of 2017.Here’s a handy graph showing that “V shape” for which everyone is hoping.  However, note that the white “business climate” line has still not rebounded to the level seen before the pandemic hit.The German business climate improved in August, according to the closely followed Ifo index.The index rose from a reading of 90.5 in July to 92.6 in August, the research institute said. That was higher than the 92.2 reading expected by economists.The economy is on a recovery course, but the economic upswing is still fragile, he warned.Good news for Devon: Infrastrata, the company that stepped in to save Belfast’s Harland \u0026amp Wolff shipyard, has bought the historic Appledore shipyard on the river Torridge.Appledore had been threatened with closure and the loss of 200 jobs after defence company Babcock International did not renew its lease in 2018. Infrastrata will pay £7m for the shipyard, which it will rename H\u0026ampW (Appledore). It hopes to focus on smaller vessels there for navies, while Belfast will focus on larger ships of more than 300m in length such as cruise ships. The Appledore shipyard traces its history back to 1855 and played a part in the shipbuilding effort during the second world war. Finablr, the embattled payments group, has delayed its accounts amid a probe into potential wrongdoing.The company had announced on 23 June that it had changed its accounting reference date to 28 February, giving it until 28 August to publish its financial statements.The company is currently unable to adhere to this deadline and will provide an update on the anticipated publication date when it is able to do so.Finablr appointed a law firm last month to investigate £1bn in undisclosed debt. The company was formerly the owner of the Travelex foreign exchange service, but lost control of it in April after it nearly collapsed.Last week the company announced that its Indian founder, BR Shetty, had resigned with immediate effect. Shetty was also the founder of NMC Health, the former FTSE 100 hospitals company that collapsed into administration in April after reporting billions more in undisclosed debt.Germany’s recession was not quite as deep as previously thought, according to revised GDP figures, but it was still the worst in the history of the reunified country.The drop is considerably larger than that seen even during the financial crisis of 2008-09.Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at the investment bank ING, said:Looking ahead, it does not take a rocket scientist to predict that the economy will have one of its best quarterly performances ever in the third quarter.  At the same time, however, the structural impact of the crisis is also surfacing, limiting too much growth enthusiasm. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.Investors appear to have taken heart from an easing in US-China trade tensions, after officials from both sides reaffirmed their commitment to reaching a deal.US trade representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese vice-premier Liu He gave the commitment to reaching a phase 1 deal in their first formal dialogue since early May.Before the coronavirus pandemic the trade tensions between the US administration of Donald Trump and China were regularly named by economists as the biggest threat to the global economy. Even now, positive news on the relationship has the power to move markets.However, optimism over potential progress in the talks is likely to be tempered by the knowledge that Trump is likely to make the relationship with China central to his re-election effort ahead of November’s election.That election battle is now in full swing, with a Republican convention full of dark warnings about the future of the USA as it got under way last night. ’s Daniel Strauss reported: Monday night’s theme was officially the ‘land of promise’, but the collection of speeches offered an almost apocalyptic vision of what’s at stake in November’s elections In UK corporate news, drug company AstraZeneca said it has started phase 1 trials (with small numbers of participants) for a “monoclonal antibody combination for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19”. The treatment, labelled AZD7442, has been funded by the US government and the company hopes it will mimic natural antibodies to give six-month protection against the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39217b317499b6a70bcaf023556bcb83dd804f9a/0_25_4547_2728/master/4547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=507e6c9693e1a5fa7680ac1a7d7aaaa1","title":"england second wave coronavirus winter surge","story":"There’s still a long way to go to prepare for a winter surge. But the country is no longer as vulnerable as it was in MarchNo one knows what the next months hold, but suggestions that Britain will be back to normal by Christmas seem unlikely. Already, Leicester, Greater Manchester and Preston have enforced local lockdowns after registering rises in Covid-19 cases, while increases in Spain and Germany are an alarming reminder of the difficulty of controlling this virus. Cold weather could potentially boost the spread of coronavirus and make social distancing outdoors more difficult. The dangers are clear – so is England ready?“We’ve got to up our game for the autumn,” says Ewan Birney, deputy director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. “We’ll be inside more. Universities and schools will be running. There will be a whole bunch of contacts we don’t have now.” England has made significant progress over the summer on some of the problems that made the first wave of coronavirus so disastrous. But this still may not be enough, and outcomes depend on factors that are hard to predict.“We can anticipate a lot more infections over the next few months,” says virologist Jonathan Ball of the University of Nottingham. The government has pledged £3bn of extra funding for the NHS, but more support and preparation may be needed urgently to cope with the challenges of this winter.The nightmare scenario for the NHS, according to Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, is a combination of events all arriving at once. A second surge of Covid-19, combined with a difficult outbreak of flu and the usual pressures that winter puts on health services, could occur at the same time that the NHS is trying to restart services that were suspended during the crisis – all faced by an exhausted staff. “We struggle with winter pressures at the best of times, with insufficient bed and community care capacity to deal with levels of demand,” Hopson says.It’s not all gloom, though. The situation with personal protective equipment has improved, as has the availability of ventilators. What matters most, however, is the capacity for testing. England’s response was crippled by its lack of testing capacity during the first wave, when scientists and public health authorities were flying blind, not knowing how widespread the virus was or where it was concentrated, and care homes were left fatally exposed.It’s different now. The UK is conducting tests as widely and as fast as most European countries: around 200,000 each day. Most of these are analysed in the Lighthouse labs established for the purpose but repurposed academic labs are also helping. “We’re in a much better position than we were at the start of the pandemic,” says molecular geneticist Andrew Beggs, who leads testing efforts at the University of Birmingham. “The government has massively increased capacity in a short space of time, and I’m more confident than I was two months ago.”What’s needed, says Ball, is “sentinel surveillance”, focused testing to actively discover levels of infection, particularly in high-risk locations such as hospitals and care homes, as well as schools and universities. The Office for National Statistics is heading a pilot survey to test a representative sample of households in the general population – up to 150,000 people a fortnight by October – to gauge the extent of infection. Such monitoring can alert public health services and epidemiologists to hotspots, so that they can be contained locally. This lets hospital staff know which patients can be safely kept on general wards, and whether they themselves are safe to be at work. Regular testing will be essential for frontline workers such as public transport staff.Tests are nearly always returned now within 48 hours (much longer and they are of little value), and often within a day. New tests developed by British companies such as Oxford Nanopore and DNANudge could hypothetically reduce the waiting time to a few hours or less – allowing for tests to be portable and conducted on site, in places such as airport check-ins, commercial centres and factories. These options are still a long way off – and they depend on whether the promising initial results from the new methods stand up, as well as the companies’ unproven ability to scale up production. But “even if one technology doesn’t work out for rapid onsite screening, we have others in the pipeline”, says Beggs.Both the number of tests and their speed still need to increase, though: Hopson thinks we’ll need about 1m tests a day by the end of December. “That’s a very tall order,” he says. And the system needs to be joined up: a test result must go at once into a patient’s health records so it can be accessed by local GPs.It’s vital too that positive results are followed up with good contact tracing, which is still the weak link in the government’s Covid response. The number of people being contacted is far lower in the UK than in other countries, such as Germany, and it’s not clear how much they are actually self-isolating. “There has been no data published on it and we know it’s not happening”, says Susan Michie, professor of health psychology at University College London. People who are financially unable to self-isolate for 14 days need to be supported, with lost earnings covered by the government.Patel predicts that schooling “will be hugely disrupted – there will be closures and outbreaks, and lots of children will be in and out of school”. Children who get the usual winter sniffles “will have to be excluded at once until they get a test result, and their parents will have to isolate for that period too”. There’s no zero-risk option, but “the best way of protecting against outbreaks in school is to minimise infection in the community”, Patel says. This means compensating for school openings with restrictions elsewhere. “Do we prioritise our ability have a drink in the pub, or the future education of our children?”So are we ready? No – that would be nigh-on impossible even with a functioning and competent government. But we’re not as woefully vulnerable as we were in March. “We have some really good plans in place for this winter”, Patel adds. “We’ve learnt a lot from the first surge, and there’s absolutely no feeling of panic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc8158545afe9f5e49b21f2e7af1b0a62091e66/0_161_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c214ed63702eedc83a0dcccebf9683c","title":"lebanon beirut ruling class","story":"Many Lebanese people had hoped for a silver lining to this tragedy of an independent government and new electionsThe tremendous blast that shook Lebanon on 4 August will be recorded as a major turning point in the country’s history, no less so than the much less powerful explosion that killed former prime minister Rafik Hariri on 14 February 2005. Judging from the 15 years it took before a UN-appointed tribunal basically admitted its impotence on the latter event, there won’t be any official certainty about the circumstances of the terrible explosion at Beirut’s port in the foreseeable future. A few conclusions can, however. be drawn about this highly traumatic tragedy.The first is that, notwithstanding the blast’s particular circumstances, the responsibility for leaving 2,750  tonnes of highly explosive ammonium nitrate warehoused in the heart of Beirut for no less than six years falls on the whole Lebanese ruling class – all those who have been in the Lebanese government during that period. Presidents, prime ministers, ministers of transport, chiefs of key security apparatuses and port administrators are all equally to blame. The list includes leaders of both the official Lebanese state and the parallel state constituted by Hezbollah in Lebanon, which is known to closely monitor Beirut’s airport and port and use them at its will.How did Lebanon get to this point? We need to take in 30 years of political and economic misrule to understand. Before 1975, when the civil war started, Lebanon was known to be a “fiscal paradise”: a country of wild capitalism, whose bank secrecy and sham taxation made it an ideal territory for money laundering, capital flight and all sorts of trafficking. The war ended with a political and constitutional agreement between Lebanese factions achieved in 1989 under the joint auspices of the Saudi monarchy and the Syrian regime. It was confirmed the year after by the latter’s participation in the US-led coalition that waged the first international war on Iraq from Saudi territory.During a dozen years, Lebanon was run by this Saudi-Syrian entente: representing the Saudi side, Rafik Hariri closely coordinated with Ghazi Kanaan, the all-powerful head of Syria’s security apparatus in Lebanon. Damascus’s opposition to the second US-led war on Iraq and the occupation of that country in 2003 led to the end of the entente. Washington started exerting pressure to expel Syrian troops from Lebanon, notably by sponsoring UN security council resolution 1559 of 2004 (Russia and China abstained in order not to veto it).Hariri’s assassination triggered a huge outpouring of popular anger, compelling Damascus to withdraw its troops. It kept pulling strings in Lebanon nevertheless, through a triple alliance composed of its close ally Amal, the Shia sectarian movement led by Nabih Berri, the Lebanese parliament’s speaker for life (he assumed office in 1992) Hezbollah, the Lebanese agent of Iran, Syria’s regional ally and Michel Aoun, Syria’s former bitter foe who about-turned in 2006.Over the past 15 years, Lebanon has basically been run by a renewed joint government, involving Rafik Hariri’s son Saad and the triple alliance, and continuing a disastrous economic policy of neoliberal reconstruction that had been in place since the end of the war. However, the war that unfolded in Syria since the 2011 Arab spring has considerably weakened Damascus and increased the role of Tehran and its Lebanese representative, as Iran gained the upper hand over Syria itself. This shift in the regional balance of forces translated into the election of Aoun as president in 2016. The botched attempt by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to twist Saad Hariri’s arm into ending collaboration with Tehran’s followers in 2017 was a clumsy reaction to this turn of events. In any event, the responsibility for the Lebanese economy’s collapse falls squarely on the whole spectrum of the country’s ruling class, all those who held offices over the past 30 years, as much as it falls on the banking sector with which they have all been enmeshed. Riad Salamé, the governor of Lebanon’s Central Bank since 1992 and still in place, embodies these entrenched problems. This shared responsibility was addressed by the now famous central slogan of the popular uprising that began on 17 October last year: “All of them means all of them.”With popular anger reaching a climax because of Beirut’s recent blast, there has been much hope in Lebanon for a silver lining to the tragedy in imposing two key demands of the October uprising on the ruling class: a government truly independent from it and new elections on the basis of a new electoral law. The expectation was that international pressure would force the implementation of these demands and provide a counterweight to the local ruling class.Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Beirut two days after the blast brought this expectation to a peak. Here was a leader who dared to mingle with the people right after the disaster, many thought, overlooking that it was a great photo-op for a French president beleaguered in his own country. The expectation did not last: Macron’s consistent line regarding the Middle East has been to mediate between the US and Iran (where French capitalist stakes are high), as he did when he attempted to organise a meeting between Donald Trump and Iran’s foreign minister on the margin of the 2019 G7 summit in Biarritz."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e75e52d6bb94b84f18f49fcff74c82a2934aa98/0_60_1599_959/master/1599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bb1fdded57fd01c2647e64dd6451011","title":"british museum removes founder hans sloane statue over slavery links","story":"Hans Sloane ‘pushed off pedestal’ and placed with artefacts putting his work in context of British empireThe British Museum has removed a bust of its founding father, who was a slave owner, and said it wanted to confront its links to colonialism.Hartwig Fischer, the institution’s director, revealed the likeness of Sir Hans Sloane has been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts explaining his work in the context of the British empire.Speaking to the Daily , Fischer said: “We have pushed him off the pedestal. We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”The decision had been taken partly as a result of the Black Lives Matter movement, the museum’s curators said. Protests against racial inequality broke out around the world following the death of George Floyd in the US in May.Sloane – a physician born in Ireland in 1660 – partly funded his collection from enslaved labour on Jamaican sugar plantations. His artefacts provided the starting point for what became the British Museum.Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this. We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”Sloane, who married a wealthy sugar plantation heiress, is honoured by numerous place names, including London’s Sloane Square.The British Museum’s demotion of its founding father is part of a wider reckoning over race triggered by Floyd’s death.In June, protesters in Bristol toppled the statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston while campaigners have reignited their calls to remove the Cecil Rhodes statue from outside an Oxford college."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad2ba91c551566b322ed043bf99f2bbbce001f90/0_38_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1c18f316971feaa351c3eee81f23aa2","title":"teachers and parents share your thoughts on face coverings in uk schools coronavirus","story":"We want to hear whether you or your children will be wearing a face covering in school to reduce the spread of coronavirusSecondary school pupils in Scotland have been advised to wear face coverings if it is impossible to physically distance, from Monday.

The children had tests to measure theeir breathing power at the ages of six, 10 and 15.The researchers compared the results with estimated levels of pollution in the areas the children had lived until they were one year old. After controlling for factors including parental smoking, the researchers found that the higher the level of pollution exposure as babies, the worse their lung function was as adolescents. The impact was even greater on children who developed asthma.A second study, also presented at the congress, found that adults who were exposed to air pollution, even at low levels, were more likely to develop asthma.The WHO limit for PM2.5 is an annual average of 10 µgm3, and the EU limit is 25. Both the WHO and EU limits for nitrogen dioxide are 40 µgm3.Shuo Liu, a visiting PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen, told the conference: “The fact that we found a link with asthma, even at relatively low levels of exposure, suggests that there is no safe threshold for air pollution. This is strong evidence that our regulations on air pollution need to be stricter if we want to prevent cases of asthma.”Thierry Troosters, president of the European Respiratory Society, said: “These studies are concerning because they suggest that current regulations, such as the EU limit values for air pollution, are not safe enough. Previous research has shown that up to 67,000 cases of childhood asthma could be avoided every year in Europe if countries would meet the World Health Organization air quality limit values, which are lower than the EU’s current standards.”Campaigners in the UK have called on the government to replace the existing EU air quality directive with more stringent legal limits. Zak Bond, a policy officer at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: “We are campaigning for the government to commit to a legal limit for PM2.5 in the environment bill in line with WHO guidelines. It’s time to reduce air pollution so everyone can breathe clean air with healthy lungs.”Chris Large, the joint-CEO at the environmental charity Global Action Plan said: “This research makes it ever clearer that even low levels can have a horrendous impact throughout people’s lives.”“We’d like the government to adopt WHO standards as a bare minimum and reallocate the £27bn set aside for a new road-building programme towards initiatives such as improving broadband quality that reduce the need for road travel.”The clean air campaigner Rosamund Kissi-Debrah said: “People are wrong to think everything is OK as long as pollution levels are within legal limits. There’s no such thing as a safe level.”Jemima Hartshorn, the founder of Mums for Lungs, called on the government to “stop dragging its feet and implement binding and enforceable WHO levels in law”. “We cannot compromise on the nation’s health,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17453cd6590d179e3968c5cd6492bde572bf513d/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a05665ac95c2337b040165538704c947","title":"can anyone stop china vast armada of fishing boats galapagos ecuador","story":"Ecuador stood up for the Galápagos, but other countries don’t stand a chance against the 17,000-strong distant-water fleetThe recent discovery by the Ecuadorean navy of a vast fishing armada of 340 Chinese vessels just off the bioerse Galápagos Islands stirred outrage both in Ecuador and overseas.Under pressure after Ecuador’s strident response, China has given mixed signals that it could begin to reel in its vast international fishing fleet. Its embassy in Ecuador declared a “zero tolerance” policy towards illegal fishing, and this week it announced it was tightening the rules for its enormous flotilla with a series of new regulations.But with 325 of those 340 ships remaining off Ecuador, and local navy commander Darwin Jarrín saying last week that nearly half of those vessels had intermittently switched off their satellite communications – breaching the rules of the regional fisheries management organisation – the episode has shown how difficult it is for small nations to stand up to China’s distant fleet even when it descends on the archipelago that inspired Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.China’s vast fishing fleet, by far the world’s largest, has been overfishing seas much further from the world’s gaze than the islands known for their giant tortoises and iguanas. From West Africa’s Gulf of Guinea to the Korean peninsula, the fleet has moved into the waters of other countries – switching off transponders to avoid detection, depleting fish stocks and threatening food security for often poor coastal communities. In east Asia, fishing vessels may act as the vanguard of an aggressive geopolitical strategy aimed at asserting territorial claims.China’s new regulations this week include harsher penalties for companies and captains involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated – or IUU – fishing. But conservationists monitoring the Galápagos episode are sceptical.“Beyond this one-sided announcement, the problem remains the same,” says Pablo Guerrero, marine conservation director for WWF Ecuador. “These boats operate without observers on board, they do not return to port, they transship their catch to mother vessels, which land the catch at ports. So, in a nutshell, they are fishing all the time, the fishing operation doesn’t stop.”The fleet is a vast and complex network. Among the hundreds of vessels are fuel providers, fishing boats, tender boats and reefers, some of which camouflage unregistered boats, Guerrero says. Many ships spend long periods at sea where shocking human rights violations have been reported.NGO Global Fishing Watch and the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) thinktank have used cutting-edge technology and data analysis to reveal that the size and scope of China’s distant-water fleet has been hugely underreported.The ODI found the fleet had 16,966 vessels, five times more than previous estimates. By contrast, the US distant-water fleet comprises 300 boats.In 2017, as part of its 13th fisheries five-year plan, China announced plans to cap the size of the fleet to 3,000 vessels by 2020.“We were shocked by the results because we were expecting 4,000 or 5,000 vessels,” says Miren Gutiérrez, the lead author of the ODI report.The research, which took more than a year, also found nearly 1,000 of the boats were using “flags of convenience” and at least 183 vessels were involved in suspected IUU fishing, for which China ranked the worst-performing nation in a 2019 global index.A ship flying a flag of convenience means the owner has registered the vessel in a country other than their own. The ship flies the ensign or flag of that country, known as the flag state and operates under its laws, typically laxer than the owner’s own.For a ship owner, the advantage of this arrangement includes comparatively fewer regulations, lower employment requirements, and thus cheaper labour, cheaper registration fees and lower or no taxes.For crew members, the disadvantages tend towards lower working standards, fewer rights and little protection. They are opposed by the International Transport Workers\u0027 Federation.Panama, which has the largest ship registry globally, followed by Liberia, operates an “open registry”, allowing foreign owners to register ships under its flag. It guarantees anonymity to the owners, making it difficult for them to be held to account.The practice began in the 1920s in the US, when owners of cruise ships registered their vessels in Panama so that they could serve their passengers alcohol during Prohibition.“Most of this overfishing is not illegal, that’s the problem,” Gutiérrez says, as most of it goes on in international waters. Most of the fleet’s vessels are trawlers – banned within China’s territorial waters and notorious for damaging  ecosystems by dragging nets along the seafloor. Other common boats are longliners, for larger fish such as tuna or shark, and squid-jiggers, which usually operate in deeper waters.China’s self-declared shake-up proposes changes to high-seas transshipment rules – the movement of cargo from one vessel to another – along with reforms to distant-water fishing. It also announced two three-month fishing moratoriums: one west of the Galápagos, between September and November, and another beginning in July in the south Atlantic near Argentina.The world’s biggest seafood exporter is also mooted to be planning to ratify the Port State Measures Agreement, the first internationally binding accord in which ports around the world pledge not to allow illegal or unregulated fishing boats to land catches.“It’s a significant concession,” says Steve Trent, executive director of the Environmental Justice Foundation. “But in the context of global fisheries it’s not enough, it’s not nearly enough.”Ecuador is one of a few small nation states that have pushed back against the Chinese flotillas. In the hotly disputed South China Sea, Indonesia sent F-16 fighter jets along with navy, coastguard and fishing boats to repel 63 Chinese fishing boats and four coastguard vessels from its waters in January.But North Korean fishing boats may have come off worse from exchanges with China’s “dark fleets”, amid reports of “ghost boats” washing up on Japanese shores containing the bodies of North Korean fishermen. In its backyard, the Chinese fleet has a fearsome reputation for systemic illegal fishing and aggressive tactics when faced with competitors or foreign patrol vessels.China signed a key UN fish stocks agreement in 1996 but never ratified it. It is a member of seven regional fishery management organisations, or RFMOs, but its distant water fleet operates outside of those frameworks, says Mercedes Rosello, director of House of Ocean, a not-for-profit legal consultancy that monitors IUU fishing.“When you are looking at thousands of vessels, the rules and mechanisms which that flag state adopts are of huge transcendence,” Rosello says.“The people who suffer first and worst are almost always the coastal communities who rely on those fisheries for their survival, wellbeing and food,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1dd4f6094c3b5c7bba4582b60eadbdf8a678dc/0_109_5222_3135/master/5222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85e617778418c19895b33d1084c4d160","title":"greta thunberg returns to school after year off","story":"Swedish environmental activist says she’s heading back to the classroom after travelling the world, spreading her conservation message Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has returned to school after a year off campaigning to curb climate change.“My gap year from school is over, and it feels so great to finally be back in school again!” the 17-year-old tweeted, attaching a smiling photo of herself with a schoolbag on her back and her hands resting on a bicycle.Thunberg did not say in which city or school she would be continuing her studies.Since her last school year finished in June 2019, the teenager’s travels around the world meant that she ended up doing lessons remotely.Rather than head into the final years of secondary school, she travelled across the Atlantic by sailing boat – hoping to highlight the carbon emissions of flying.Her ultimate destination had been the COP25 UN climate conference in Chilean capital Santiago.But the event was ultimately shifted to Madrid because of massive unrest in Chile, leaving Thunberg to sail back from the US to Europe on board a catamaran belonging to a young Australian couple.While in North America, Thunberg rebuked world leaders at the UN, had a repeat visit with former US President Barack Obama, was given the keys to the city of Montreal and travelled around the continent in a Tesla electric car lent by former California governor and action star Arnold Schwarzenegger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4955726245c4eaa2d0a27242ffca965b46689881/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6105803f58bbafc2ed78f846a9a9a815","title":"special branches the nominations to be englands tree of the year in pictures","story":"A sycamore laced with the shoes of jubilant students, a haunted oak bound in chains and a Hackney plane facing the chop are among the 10 contenders to become England’s tree of the year.

Three cool monosyllables, surname first, a little curtly, as befits a former naval commander. And then, as if in afterthought, the first name, followed by the surname again – for all the world as if we needed it narrowed down, and wouldn’t recognise one of the world’s most famous fictional brands. Sean Connery carried it off with icily disdainful style, perhaps at the baccarat table, in full evening dress with a cigarette hanging from his lips.The introduction was a kind of challenge, or seduction, invariably addressed to an enemy. And the subtly anglicised Edinburgh accent, which appeared to soften or muddy those monosyllables, encouraged legions of comics and pub bores to think that they, too, could do the voice. In the early 60s, Connery’s James Bond was about as dangerous and sexy as it got on screen – until directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Sidney Lumet came along, and saw how Connery’s on-screen menace could be taken to the next level.Connery became James Bond in 1962 after minor roles in British movies and an appearance in a Walt Disney whimsy called Darby O’Gill and the Little People. As 007, he was an instant, staggering success – conveying exactly the right dangerous sexiness and borderline-sociopathic capacity for disciplined violence – much mocked, much drooled over. The former milkman and bodybuilder was the working-class Bond, a Bond who had come up through the ranks, though director Terence Young reputedly schooled him in the ways of classiness: how to dress, how to light a cigarette. Connery’s natural muscular power and wry humour modified the elegance and eccentricity of Bond in just the right way. Ian Fleming was sufficiently impressed to fabricate Scottish roots for Bond in subsequent books.As much as the Beatles, it was Connery’s charismatic Bond who kept alive Britain’s postwar amour-propre. Does Britain appear to be waning pathetically on the world stage? Oh no. Britain is still powerful – but in secret, you see, like 007. Connery’s Bond created the notion that the soft-culture brand image, the tricks and the toys, the gadgets and the cars, could be just as potent as real power and wealth. He played the role seven times, in Dr No (1962), From Russia With Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967) and then two afterthought Bonds, Diamonds Are Forever (1971), when his hairline appeared suddenly to come forward after some years of retreat, and Never Say Never Again (1983), effectively a retread of Thunderball. His public image was merged with that of 007, and he accepted this burden with the same dangerously simmering resentment and controlled anger that made him such a glorious success as Bond. Perhaps only Daniel Radcliffe has experienced the same utter immersion or self-annihilation.Connery went on to great things outside Her Majesty’s Secret Service – but it took a while. Long after he had handed in his gun and renounced his double-O licence, Connery maintained the prerogative of sexiness. For the 1999 heist caper Entrapment, nearing 70, Connery was considered an entirely plausible action lead and romantic partner for the 30-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones.His appearance in Hitchcock’s Marnie in 1964 focused on the dark side that had been nurtured in the Bond franchise, but without the justification of missions on the secret service, it looked more unsettling. His wealthy publisher Mark Rutland is arrogant, possessive – and a rapist. The saturnine darkness of Connery answers the strangeness and anxieties in Tippi Hedren’s mysterious Marnie.The other great Connery picture from the Bond years was Sidney Lumet’s brutal The Hill (1965), in which he plays a soldier sent to a military prison camp in the Libyan desert and forced, with the others, to endure sadistic punishments such as climbing a man-made “hill” in full pack in the burning sun. This role showcased the rougher, tougher side of the young Connery that 007 had smoothed away somewhat.The 70s were a mixed bag for Connery. He appeared as the mysterious exterminator Zed in John Boorman’s cult sci-fi Zardoz (1974), and the famous image of Connery in a bizarre red posing pouch and thigh-length boots is something that has tested the faith of Connery fans for decades. He had another brilliant, brutal role in Sidney Lumet’s The Offence (1971) as a cop who has murdered a suspected child molester during interrogation and whose motivations are gradually disclosed in flashback.He had two other great films in this period. John Huston’s The Man Who Would Be King (1975) was a classic epic in the Lean style, based on the Kipling novella, in which Connery and Michael Caine play British ex-military chancers Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan. Trying their luck in the fictional and worryingly named land of Kafiristan, they look to become staggeringly wealthy when the credulous natives mistake them for gods.Richard Lester’s Robin and Marian (1976) found a quieter, gentler register in Connery, owning up to his advancing years, really for the first time in his career – playing the ageing Robin Hood, opposite Audrey Hepburn’s Marian.The 80s saw Sean Connery in various autumnal and humorously self-deprecating moods. His simmer and smoulder had aged well into a potent maturity – Connery endured endless “single malt” analogies from well-meaning interviewers – and that baldness, once feared, looked like authentic masculinity. He played Agamemnon in Terry Gilliam’s Time Bandits (1981), and he also won a much-merited Academy Award for best supporting actor in Brian De Palma’s The Untouchables (1987), playing the courageous, straight-arrow cop Jimmy Malone, who helps Kevin Costner’s Eliot Ness take on Al Capone, played by Robert De Niro.Connery’s comic chops were on display playing Professor Henry Jones, disapproving dad of Indiana Jones, in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) – though Connery was only 12 years older than Ford. There were other roles, and Connery contributed to Finding Forrester (2000) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) with great aplomb. By this time, his legendary status, quite distinct from Bond, was something he carried around with him.I’ve met Sean Connery just once, in 1999, at the Edinburgh film festival, of which he was patron, introduced to him by the festival’s then artistic director Lizzie Francke. Unlike other men of his age, Connery seemed to have got taller with his years, and I remember almost leaning back to look up at him, as if trying to see the flagstaff atop a famous building – although that was maybe just natural awe. He stood as still as a statue at those public red-carpet events, and let the guests and the paparazzi come to him.I remember him saying to me, crisply, and with a formidable air of daring me to disagree: “Lynne Ramsay’s Ratcatcher is a great film.” It was the opening film at Edinburgh that year. Of course I agreed, but could think of nothing worthwhile to do or say other than to open and close my mouth idiotically, like a goldfish, and finally squeak “Yes.” After a second or two, Sir Sean turned and resumed his conversation with Lizzie, accustomed to this sort of encounter with gobsmacked male journalists. But I’m glad I said something to this legendary figure – and didn’t try to introduce myself formally."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be303a3fbc3b7f6ab5a1886421470da6fb9b86c/116_0_3271_1965/master/3271.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bd8fd1d52342504199d1bbc1f4df2a6","title":"sing hallelujah batfleck batman and chris pines steve trevor all return at dc fandome","story":"A number of new projects teased by Warner Bros’ DC FanDome raise some awkward questions about crossover – but just go with the multiverseFantasy Hollywood producer is a fun game to play. Imagine being given the resources to – just for a laugh – resurrect Alex Cox’s doomed version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or Tony Kaye’s original cut of American History X. There must be scores of bona fide lost classics lurking on the cutting room floor, if only we had the time, money and inclination to bring them back to life.But Zack Snyder’s original cut of the 2017 superhero megaflop Justice League? The jury remains out on whether this will be any better than the version edited by Joss Whedon that bombed in cinemas, but we are getting it anyway at great expense via an extended debut on US streaming service HBO Max.The issue is that Watchmen boasted truly iconic source material for the film-maker to riff on, and Snyder is pretty good when all he has to do is take other artists’ ideas and make them look awesome. It remains to be seen whether Chris Terrio’s original screenplay for Justice League has the depth to match the trailer’s splendid looking visuals. But, for now, it’s enough to say that the new cut looks worth checking out, especially for the army of DC fans who objected to Whedon’s hiring in the first place.Also screening via DC FanDome was an early look at Matt Reeves’ The Batman, via the film’s debut full-length teaser. Hang on a minute, you might be thinking, wasn’t Batman also in Justice League (except played by Ben Affleck rather than Robert Pattinson)? And you’d be right to wonder what is going on, except these things are immaterial now that DC has decided to mutter “multiverse” loudly whenever such awkward questions are presented.Reeves’ more minimalist take on Gotham City has been promising to take us back to the dark knight as world’s greatest detective, and there is certainly an abiding sense of curdled, dread-filled noir hanging over the first trailer. Colin Farrell, in heavy prosthetics, makes a particularly rancid and forbidding Penguin, and there are even hints that the legacy of the Joker may be lingering in the shadows – Batman is seen brutally taking down a gang of ne’er-do-wells sporting ghost-white face paint.What a choice Jeffrey Wright is to play the new James Gordon. He’s guaranteed to bring something fresh and distinctive to one of the most well-trodden roles in comic-book cinema. It remains to be seen whether Reeves and Pattinson can do the same for Gotham’s caped crusader himself, but the signs are good, even if most Batman fans probably never expected to find out that Bruce Wayne sports smudgy, emo-style eye shadow underneath that forbidding cowl.Up next is the latest trailer for Wonder Woman 1984, Patty Jenkins’ sequel to the best DC movie so far, released in 2017. This is our first proper look at Kristen Wiig’s Cheetah, the movie’s main baddie. And yet the introduction of the feline supervillain is overshadowed by the return of Chris Pine’s Steve Trevor, who appears to have been set up for a traditional fish-out-of-water storyline in the 80s-set sequel. There are undoubtedly laughs to be had by transporting a first world war veteran to the decade of sequins, scrunchies and shoulder pads, but the movie is also going to have to explain how Trevor survived being blown up on a plane filled with poison in the earlier movie (not to mention the fact that he doesn’t appear to have aged).The 70s Wonder Woman TV show got round a similar issue, as the action jumped from the second world war to the present day at the end of its first season, by making its new Steve Trevor (still played by actor Lyle Waggoner) the son of the previous iteration. Let’s hope Jenkins et al have a better solution up their sleeve than Chris Pine Jr. Otherwise, they can always try shouting “multiverse” again at any pesky unbelievers, and running hard in the opposite direction."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b00d7e95fc2232754b66912bcc66f0ccfc1a73/0_194_3888_2333/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=411bb852690862a86506dbbae8b3b8e5","title":"africa to be declared free of wild polio after decades of work","story":"Achievement comes following Nigeria vaccination drive, with last cases of wild virus recorded four years agoAfrica is expected to be declared free from wild polio, after decades of work by a coalition of international health bodies, national and local governments, community volunteers and survivors.Four years after the last recorded cases of wild polio in northern Nigeria, the Africa Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) is expected to certify that the continent is free of the virus, which can cause irreversible paralysis and in some cases death.The achievement is the result of a campaign to vaccinate and monitor children in Borno State, the final front of polio eradication efforts on the continent, and the heart of the jihadist insurgency in Nigeria.“It’s been a momentous, massive undertaking, with amazing persistence and perseverance, coming in the face of moments when we thought we were just about there, then we’d have a reversal,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa, said.The WHO, she said, had played a central coordinating role within the Global Polio Eradication Initiative – a coalition of national governments and local leaders, working with Unicef, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – and with millions of community volunteers across the continent.Improved surveillance, tackling violent levels of vaccine scepticism that fuelled deadly attacks on health workers and the inclusion of polio survivors within eradication teams were key factors in wiping out the virus, said Moeti.“I would really like to pay tribute to polio survivors, who have joined in the fight, who have helped in sharing their experiences of disability with polio and the impact this has had on their lives,” she said.In 1996, 75,000 children in Africa were paralysed by polio.The fight now is to improve the lives of survivors, said Moeti.“This moment underlines the importance of paying attention and better prioritising the needs of people with disabilities in the African region. Health is not just the absence of a disease that can kill, it is a complete sense of wellbeing,” she said.Musbahu Lawan Didi, co-founder of Nigeria’s Association of Polio Survivors, campaigning for the rights of those with polio , said: “It is incredible that what we have started years ago has built these results. As polio survivors we are the happiest and believe we’ll be the last polio survivors in the country.”But he added: “Ninety percent of polio survivors in Nigeria live in poverty. Many of us are trawling the streets to survive, begging. It should not be so.”Dr Rose Leke, chair of the ARCC, an independent body set up by the WHO, said the declaration followed exhaustive assessments of surveillance systems in 47 African countries to ensure no cases were missedDespite the progress, however, 16 countries in the region are currently experiencing small outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio,which can occur among underimmunised communities.Efforts to eradicate wild polio globally were spurred by the formation of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. Since then, cases of wild polio have fallen dramatically from an estimated 350,000 cases to 33 reported cases in 2018. In Africa, a campaign by leaders from the continent, led by Nelson Mandela, helped drive progress.But the insurgency in northern Nigeria made the disease hard to shift. In 2013, nine women who were vaccinating children in Kano were shot dead by gunmen suspected of belonging to Boko Haram.At least 67 frontline health workers involved in polio eradication efforts in the region have been killed, with others attacked and abducted. Several violent incidentswere spurred by a rejection of vaccinations by local communities, said Dr Tunji Funsho, head of Rotary International’s Nigeria polio committee.“A challenge was insidious rumours that the vaccine is not safe, that it could lead to HIV, Aids, could sterilise women with a view to reduce the population in the northern part of the country,” he said. Suspicion of western aligned medical initiatives, and of efforts to suppress Muslim majorities caught alight in the region.In July 2003, five states in northern Nigerian suspended the use of polio vaccinations for at least a year. Annual cases in Nigeria then soared, with Nigerian strains of the virus spreading across Africa.The bitter legacy of controversial medical trials for other diseases in northern Nigeria also fuelled opposition to vaccinations.But a big effort to appeal to political, community and religious leaders, along with public campaigns and town hall meetings began a gradual turnaround.In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari was televised personally administering oral vaccine drops to one of his grandchildren.“The sad thing is that some rejections are not just because they don’t believe in the polio vaccine, but they have … needs that come first,” said Funsho. For example, polio vaccinations take precedence over healthcare for more fatal diseases like malaria.“So refusing vaccines becomes a kind of protest against the government,” he said, explaining that it was a way of impressing the need for greater investment in healthcare.He said in some cases, fathers refused vaccines for their children because they were too ashamed to reveal their children had not eaten and were fearful it would induce a reaction. “We’ve had to make sure we really understand and listen to people’s needs and concerns,” Funsho said.The increased involvement of polio survivors over the past decade was crucial to addressing the concerns from local communities, said Lawan Didi, who was diagnosed with polio when he was two. “People saw us, and communicated with us. We could explain to them this is not a spiritual thing, but can be prevented with vaccines. It gave them a change of heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d601ab2b6ef6d4287f6c98d27dc1b71804bd15e9/486_400_2766_1661/master/2766.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58e51e5ede2ff88dfe27351bc8bbbfc5","title":"leadership of merged dfid evidence of hostile takeover by fco say critics","story":"NGOs and MPs fear appointments to Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office reflects unbalanced prioritiesThe UK’s ambassador to the EU is to become political director of the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), one of seven senior officials who will form the core of the leadership team when the department launches next week.Tim Barrow is one of five appointees from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office chosen to serve on the board of the FCDO. Two further appointments are officials from the Department for International Development (DfID).Barrow, who joined the FCO in 1986, was appointed as the UK’s EU ambassador in January 2017.Staff at the FCO and DfID have been reassured that the merger, announced by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, in June, does not represent a takeover by the FCO.However, the timing and makeup of the leadership team were immediately questioned by critics, who argue the new department will jeopardise Britain’s position as a world leader in development and risk abandoning its commitment to poor people in low-income countries.Staff were told by the new department’s permanent secretary, Sir Philip Barton, that the makeup of the team would send “an important signal about our ambition for the FCDO, our determination to integrate diplomacy and development in a transformational way”, the Financial Times reported.The two DfID officials on the leadership team are Juliet Chua, director general for finance and corporate performance, and Moazzam Malik, director general of country programmes. Malik will serve as director general for Africa at the FCDO.Preet Gill, Labour’s shadow international development secretary, said: “We are really surprised. Allegedly the department is supposed to be up and running by 1 September. To announce the leadership team a week before that is pretty typical of the incompetence and bluster of this government.”Gill, who has described the new Whitehall department as a takeover by the FCO, said: “There is nothing here to convince me otherwise.”She added: “There are only two DfID people here. FCO people are going to be leading in development, but they don’t have the experience and understanding. It is the world’s poorest who will suffer.”Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, the UK network for development NGOs, said: “We are disappointed to see a complete lack of balance between development and foreign policy experience in the newly announced FCDO interim leadership team and are concerned this could be a sign of development increasingly taking a back seat to diplomatic and commercial interests.”She added: “If this merger is to succeed, then it requires a balance across areas of expertise such as tackling disease, assisting humanitarian and peacebuilding efforts, providing sanitation and clean water, or securing access to quality education for girls. It is critical that the final senior team and non-executive roles have an equal balance of development and diplomatic experience.”Sarah Champion, Labour MP and chair of the international development committee which scrutinises UK aid, said: “Consistently, I’ve been concerned that this is a hostile takeover rather than an equal partnership. The makeup of the senior leadership team just reinforces that for me.”The committee’s interim report into the effectiveness of aid, published in June, argued strongly that an independent aid-giving department with a cabinet-level minister leading its work was imperative if the UK was to help end extreme poverty.The merger has been widely criticised, including by three former prime ministers, David Cameron, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8547f133b956a0fbc3b6a5e8d10adbd848f01f81/0_424_4242_2546/master/4242.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a4fc48d46c3c0b6cecf34f6bb51d970e","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

Now a more positive story is emergingShortly before the infamous 1970 Isle of Wight festival, Stanley Dunmore, a local public health inspector, worried about “a possible breakdown of public order … if the festival is a failure, or falls short of expectations, or the weather is bad, or facilities which the fans expect to find in the town are not available”.His observations, made when music festivals were in their infancy, confirm some things that we know about them today – if only Billy McFarland and Ja Rule had read Dunmore’s report before the spectacular failure of Fyre festival. These events are complex and expensive to coordinate, especially in remote settings with inebriated and underprepared crowds cowed by the weather. If things go wrong, disaster can ensue.Isle of Wight 1970 became the British festival that we associate with disaster. The myth goes that a group of young men, out to make a few quid from youthful music fans, put on the largest-ever pop festival in Britain at the time. To protect their investment and rake in gate receipts, they erected fencing around the site to contain the crowd of 600,000 and exclude troublemakers. Building on a few references in the press, the popular image is of radicals and French anarchists flooding down from Desolation Hill, which overlooked the festival site, and ripping down the fencing. In a recent article on Joni Mitchell’s performance, the  reported that “fights broke out, objects were thrown, and a lot of bad acid was taken”.But it is easy to get the wrong impression about the 1970 festival. It has been mythologised and attacked for personal and political reasons, but against most criteria other than finances (a £40,000-£60,000 loss), the evidence that I unearthed for my first book reveals a beguiling and misunderstood story. It suggests the festival was not as bad as it seems – in fact, at the time some saw it as the British Woodstock.The first Isle of Wight festival, in 1968, attracted about 8,000 festivalgoers to Hell Field near Godshill. Three Labour-supporting brothers in their early 20s brought to the island from Derbyshire during childhood, Ray, Bill and Ronald Foulk, instigated the festival to raise funds to build a municipal indoor swimming pool.The 1969 festival exceeded their wildest expectations. Bob Dylan, who had hardly played live since his motorbike accident in 1966, attracted the world’s media and 80,000 to 100,000 festivalgoers. Ray Foulk says the 1969 festival was not without hiccups – he told me that “the catering was not adequate we were ripped off and the public were”, and a lack of toilets led to long queues. But the promoters learned on their feet and overcame these problems good weather did not test the amenities at the site, now in Wootton. There was a headline performance from the Who, and Dylan’s appearance was a culturally significant moment – a pilgrimage – for the postwar generation.It teed up the 1970 festival, one of the largest outdoor gatherings in Britain since the war, even if the figure of 600,000 is probably an overestimate. The event might not have taken place if local councillors, well-connected islanders and their Conservative MP, Mark Woodnutt, had had their way. In letters to the environment department, Woodnutt argued that the festival could cause a polio epidemic (the island had suffered one in 1949) and that the 1969 festival had “left a scene of indescribable filth”. However, he would need a high court injunction to stop the festival, and proof that the festival was a threat to public and environmental health rather than simply a nuisance.Mindful of a a possible injunction, the Foulks’ company Fiery Creations reminded the council of the lack of trouble during the 1969 festival and the good publicity the island received because of the event. Dunmore, the health inspector, and Douglas Quantrill, the island’s chief medical officer, alleviated sanitation and safety fears, and helped coordinate organisations from macrobiotic caterers to National Rail.Without legal recourse, local pressure groups and councillors disingenuously claimed the island lacked suitable sites for a large festival and pressured landowners into refusing to rent land. The East Afton site was only agreed in early August, weeks before the festival opened at the start of the bank holiday. The valley, flanked by a hill on National Trust property and near idyllic beaches below white cliffs, would soon host a stage, 20 turnstiles, 66 food and drink stalls, 500 toilets and 600 feet of urinals.Reports from the time, and footage, suggest that the crowd witnessed some stunning performances. The lineup included the Who, Miles Davis, Joan Baez, Joni Mitchell, the Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Sly and the Family Stone and Gilberto Gil Jimi Hendrix played one of his last performances before his death. Recently rediscovered photographs taken by Peter Bull show calm and content festivalgoers, who resemble their contemporary counterparts aside from their attire, lack of mobile phones and the fact that they’re nearly all sitting down.There were disturbances, though. A group, no more than 200 of those camping on Desolation Hill, attempted to break down the perimeter wall the day before the festival began. Later, on Sunday morning, organisers and audience argued when security cleared the inner arena for Jethro Tull’s soundcheck and to check tickets. At 4pm on Sunday afternoon, MC Rikki Farr declared the festival free (to the horror of Ray Foulk who was standing in the crowd) and, after the announcement, the inner arena wall was dismantled from the inside by ticket holders, prompting a queue of concerned workers and creditors seeking immediate payment backstage. There were 117 arrests for possession of drugs.Conflicts do not feature prominently in the official record, however. Douglas Osmond, the chief constable of Hampshire police, dressed up like a hippy and went incognito on Desolation Hill for a day. He claimed to see less violence than at a typical football match and concluded that “people become unduly anxious about these gatherings”.Every national newspaper reported on the festival, with some of them, glad for news in August, printing extensive coverage. These generally positive reports were punctuated by scurrilous stories about sex and drugs, outraged locals and photographs of nude (mostly female) bodies. The Sunday Mirror’s account explained: “This isn’t quite paradise. But if you are young and can look after yourself and the sun stays out and the music stays loud, it doesn’t matter.”It is interesting, then, that a view of the festival as a disaster has come to dominate. Organisers blame the late documentary film-maker Murray Lerner. Fiery Creations and Lerner wanted to emulate the success of the 1970 Woodstock documentary, which took just under $50m at the US box office, but their Isle of Wight film did not find a distributor until 1997 and the delay caused acrimony. Ray Foulk, particularly in the second volume of his book When the World Came to the Isle of Wight, and Peter Harrigan, Fiery Creations’ publicist, allege that Lerner removed footage of isolated incidents of trouble from their context and spliced them between performances for drama. For instance, Lerner’s documentary edited the footage of arguments in the main arena on Sunday morning to include shots of some drunken jeering and stray beers thrown at a lighting tower. The film exaggerates the intensity, significance and extent of either disturbance. It was, Foulk said, “complete fakery” and “besmirched not just the festival but a whole generation of people”. Indeed, he argues that the festival was only declared free to benefit Lerner’s documentary in the first place.The organisers also made the mistake of inviting International Times (IT), a London-based countercultural paper, to view the site under construction. As head of the British White Panthers, its editor, Mick Farren, published communiques in pamphlets and IT that encouraged resistance. He saw the increased price (to £3, about the price of a double album) and security as an affront to his left-libertarian view that music festivals should be free, and claimed that the fences, security dogs and turnstiles evoked prison camps.After losing £6,000 on their own free festival a month before, Phun City near Worthing, the 1970 Isle of Wight festival provided Farren and his peers a chance for some agitprop myth-making to champion the radical underground. Take Jean-Jacques Lebel, the only one of the “French anarchists” that can be identified from the festival despite that phrase recurring in several accounts – thanks to his involvement in the counterculture, Lebel could amplify his role in the festival’s mythology and its political significance through the underground press.Farren’s fear about repression and exploitation were not misplaced, but misdirected. The idea that festivals had radical potential, alongside stigma concerning festivalgoers’ propriety, took hold, and exacerbated the anxieties and prejudices of conservative Isle of Wight residents. The county council had received calls to stop pop festivals since 1969 – one letter described festivalgoers as “social parasites” – and following the 1970 event Woodnutt introduced legislation to prevent another festival on the island. The council now had complete discretion over licenses for overnight events with a crowd over 5,000, and organisers would have to give four months’ notice. Subsequently, there were no further festivals there there until 2002.Other rural areas wanted similar control and Conservative MP Jerry Wiggin’s Night Assemblies Bill offered it. The bill proposed criminalising any outdoor gathering of 1,000 people or more between midnight and 6am unless the organisers applied to a local authority at least four months before and provided financial guarantees.The bill did not, however, define the “pop festival” clearly and therefore threatened the right to free assembly. The National Council for Civil Liberties argued it would “stifle political opinion and prevent activity at a time when too much emphasis is being put upon law and order at the expense of justice and liberty”, and the bill failed.It exposed, though, tension between young people, the counterculture and rural British conservatism. The vitriol aimed at pop festivals, and the types of social change that they were seen to represent, is startling. Great Western festivals ran into to trouble, for instance, in Tollesbury, Essex, in 1972 when trying to find a festival site (it ultimately settled on Bardney, Lincolnshire). The local villagers burned effigies of the organisers, Lord Harlech and the actor Stanley Baker – the type of hip capitalists that countercultural radicals also feared. A local explained that this was because the festival would cause the “sheer rape of our way of life”. The panic over festivals became a trope for bored reporters in the summertime and justification for heavy-handed policing, as those brutally attacked by Thames Valley police at the Windsor free festival in 1974 will attest.Quantrill, meanwhile, became a public health celebrity, if there is such a thing. Councils sought him out for advice on festivals and at the Royal Society of Health Symposium in 1971 he argued, in what became a widely circulated paper, that there was little risk in a reasonably well-planned festival such as the Isle of Wight 1970. The government select committee issued an official code of practice to guide local authorities and festival organisers, undermining “anarchic” or free festivals by giving local authorities clearer grounds for injunctions if a festival did not meet the code’s expensive recommendations. Without significant capital and a willing council, it made it harder for enthusiastic amateurs such as Fiery Creations to run a festival, leaving rural landowners and posh hipsters increasingly in charge.When you attend the modern-day music festival, however, you are, in a sense, stepping into a world made by three brothers, their friends and a handful of kindly civil servants.

Napster, which has 3 million users, has a library of 90m licensed tracks.The two-year-old British company, which has hosted gigs by acts including Emeli Sandé, The Chainsmokers and Cypress Hill, has enjoyed strong growth during the coronavirus pandemic, with fans turning to online entertainment as the live music industry ground to a halt.The company set up safe studios in London and Los Angeles to enable artists to perform gigs, with fans paying to watch via its app. It has run about a dozen virtual reality gigs to date.Anthony Matchett, chief executive of MelodyVR, said: “MelodyVR’s acquisition of Napster will result in the development of the first ever music entertainment platform which combines immersive visual content and music streaming.“Our purchase of Napster, one of the music industry’s original disrupters, is born out of a wish to present a truly next-generation music service.”Last year, Napster delivered 10.8bn streams to its consumer and business partners, making $113m in revenues and $1.8m in pre-tax profits.The reverse takeover of the business marks the latest twist in Napster’s chequered 21-year history. Founded in 1999 by Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker, the service allowed music users to share music files bypassing the traditional record business and marked the beginning of the inexorable decline of the CD.Lawsuits from the music industry and artists from Dr Dre to Metallica ensued and Napster filed for bankruptcy in 2002. It was snapped up by Roxio and re-launched as a legal business and was later bought by US electronics retailer Best Buy for £121m. On-demand streaming service Rhapsody acquired Napster in 2011 and adopted the brand name in 2016.• Sign up to the daily Business Today email here or follow  Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1277994b9ed72879ee0bfdab7c07ba096bc16ec5/107_0_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ca3054467249217ed1927a22c4e9fb1","title":"uks pandering to us is delaying zaghari ratcliffe release lawyers claim","story":"Lawyers call for meeting with defence secretary and accuse government of waiting for US permission to pay money owed to IranThe British government has deliberately delayed taking steps necessary to secure the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe – including payment of a £400m debt owed to Iran – for fear of offending the Trump administration, lawyers acting for the British-Iranian woman have alleged.The lawyers requested a meeting with the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and his advisers at the “earliest convenience” to discuss the approach the government was taking on the issue of debt owed to Iran.In a seven-page letter to Wallace, the lawyers accuse the government of procrastination and claim the UK’s approach to securing the release of dual nationals from Tehran jails has been far less effective than those of other countries – including the US. A BBC Panorama programme broadcast a similar charge on Monday night.Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been under effective house arrest in Tehran since March when she was given temporary release from prison having served four years of a five-year sentence for alleged espionage. She was arrested in Tehran in April 2016.Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has alleged that her full release has been held back by the UK’s failure to settle an acknowledged £400m debt over an arms deal with the late shah of Iran.In the letter to Wallace, the lawyers say it is astonishing that International Military Services (IMS), a UK government agency, “continues to raise every possible legal objection to payment of the debt and has plainly failed to engage in constructive dialogue with Tehran”.The letter claims the Foreign Office evades and prevaricates when it is asked the simplest questions on the steps it may be taking to pay the debt, which has been the subject of more than a decade of court disputes.It says a decision to defer the next high court hearing on the debt until 4 November, a day after the US presidential election “in effect plays politics with the lives of British citizens”.The lawyers claim: “The UK government is apparently waiting for implicit permission from the US government to pay the UK’s legally owed debts, payment of which would allow Nazanin (and other innocent British nationals) finally to come home. The message appears to be that the safety of British citizens abroad is subordinate to falling in line with US policy.”The UK stance is somewhat paradoxical, the letter says, in that the US has itself negotiated two prisoner swaps with Iran recently.It also claims British tactics have failed to deter the Tehran regime, saying: “There has been a new wave of forced confessions and prisoners being tortured, a new programme of family members of activists and prisoners being arrested, more instances of second sentences being levelled against cellmates of Nazanin who would otherwise be eligible for release.”Part of the purpose of the letter is to warn the UK government that its actions risk endangering the freedom of more British dual nationals.The letter concludes: “It is important that the UK both honours its legally owed obligations to Iran, but also calls out the Iranian government on its illegal treatment of Nazanin under Iranian law. However, the UK government has done precisely the opposite: obtusely refusing to discharge its legal obligations, whilst remaining silent and appeasing Iran in the face of Tehran’s atrocious abuse of Nazanin’s human rights.”The Ministry of Defence said: “The defence secretary’s position on this matter has not changed. As previous government statements have made clear, we remain committed to securing the immediate and permanent release of all arbitrarily detained dual British nationals in Iran and regularly lobby for their release at the highest levels. This includes through the prime minister, the foreign secretary and the British ambassador in Tehran.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d1d415c2ae304f725b5f39204e2acc7e","title":"amy tinkler british gymnastics complaint coach amanda reddin dismissed","story":"Rio Olympic bronze medallist Amy Tinkler has launched a blistering attack on British Gymnastics after they dismissed her complaint against Britain’s top women’s coach Amanda Reddin, saying she felt “sick” at the outcome – and warning that it would discourage other gymnasts from speaking out.After revealing for the first time that Reddin was part of a complaint about bullying in the sport made last December, Tinkler said that the governing body had told her that her allegations against Reddin had been dealt with and the matter was closed.“On Friday, and only in response to media pressure, I was emailed informing me that my complaints had been dealt with and the matter closed,” she wrote on Twitter.“The way I received this information made me sick. It reinforced mine and every gymnasts’ fear, which is that their complaints aren’t dealt with fairly and independently. This is why we don’t speak up. This is why we suffer in silence. We know that to speak up is a pointless, career-ending task.”Tinkler said she is now seeking an explanation from British Gymnastics regarding the contact she received on Friday. British Gymnastics confirmed that an investigation into Tinkler’s complaint about bullying while she was at South Durham Gymnastics Club is still active.On Tuesday UK Sport and Sport England announced that an independent review into bullying allegations at British Gymnastics would be led by Anne Whyte QC. It said the independent review would address:Tinkler confirmed she would be submitting her complaints to the independent review for consideration: “Every gymnast deserves better than this,” she added.Separately, the BBC and ITV News has reported that Reddin, who is due to lead the women’s gymnastics team to next year’s Games in Tokyo has also been cleared of one historical allegation of abuse.The BBC said that a gymnast called Jenny, who had been coached by Reddin at the Bright School of Gymnastics in the 1980s, told BBC Sport that she had been slapped and verbally abused by the coach.In its response, British Gymnastics said Reddin had categorically denied slapping gymnasts, saying she would only give “little taps and nibbles” to show gymnasts how they should be working.It also said she denied using “excessive force” on a gymnast to stretch them and that, at the time the response was written, there were no complaints against her.Another Rio Olympian Ruby Harrold said Reddin presided over a “culture of fear” at the Team GB camps in Lilleshall, and described food portions that left her and her fellow gymnasts hungry.Harrold said: “How would you feel if you were 21 years old being given ultimately a baby plate to eat off? It’s demeaning … it’s unhealthy.”However in a response to ITV, Reddin said: “I completely refute the historical claim, and the investigation by British Gymnastics did not uphold the complaint. I completely refute these claims, it is wrong that my reputation within the sport that I love is now subject to a trial by media rather than through the proper processes.“I would welcome the allegations be submitted to the independent review into alleged abuse in gymnastics to ensure the integrity of the process is protected for both athletes and coaches.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d4dce06b2a10ae66bc4b6860f3ba6294d281c5/502_413_3950_2369/master/3950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc78f3872cf56e48119a5a849d17bffa","title":"womens cricket well placed avoid male stunting progress rachael heyhoe flint trophy the spin","story":"Opportunities for women to play the game were historically limited but the Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Trophy and a new book make the case that they will be at its heart in futureThe history of women’s cricket seems a relatively recent one. If you were asked to guess at the year the British media first covered a women’s county game, you might place it within the past decade. Perhaps, aware of the golden age that existed between the world wars – of names like Betty Snowball and Myrtle Maclagan – you would fix on the 1930s. It’s unlikely you’d go all the way back to 1811, when Hampshire and Surrey XIs played each other, watched on by the sportswriter, and observer of London life, Pierce Egan.This was no piece of hit and giggle. The game was played over three days – a Wednesday, Thursday and Monday in early October – on a field near Newington Green in north London. It was deemed “very excellent play” by Egan, who was impressed by the Surrey bowling and fielding, and drew a large crowd, its result staked for 500 guineas by two competing aristocrats. An innings of 41 by one of the Hampshire batters (cruelly run out in her pomp) helped Hampshire to a two-wicket win, despite interruptions for poor weather. When it was done, the women, keen to keep playing, arranged a single-wicket match, then walked half an hour down the road for a picnic at the Angel, Islington.Women have been playing cricket since its early incarnations in the middle ages. The proof is under lock and key at Oxford’s Bodleian Library, where a group of them are depicted in a 14th-century painting, playing a mixed game in which the central figure is a female bowler. Village matches for women were popular throughout the 18th century, and there were men willing to support and encourage the pursuit.What changed those attitudes? The bourgeois inclinations of the Victorians, that’s what. In Ladies and Lords, her academic history of the game, Raf Nicholson notes that in the 18th century, cricket was still “largely confined to the lower classes”. The emergence of the new English middle class, and its “consignment of women to the home” as part of the feminine ideal, was the real reason women’s cricket all but disappeared.“In such an environment, opportunities for partaking in sport were minimal,” writes Nicholson. By the time the game regained fashion among women in the late 19th century, it was considered “manly”. Men’s aptitude for the game was considered essential to the future of the empire women’s was either a curiosity or a near-political act.There has been valid concern whether, in the post-pandemic sporting landscape, male priorities might, once again, stunt the progress of women’s cricket. When South Africa and India’s women both pulled out of a planned triangular tournament against England, it fed the narrative that, when times get tough, opportunities for women are the first to be sacrificed.And yet, the behind-the-scenes story during this season of Covid-19 has been a far more positive one. When the England and Wales Cricket Board signed off its emergency budget to stage international cricket behind closed doors, it was done with equal provision for the men’s and women’s teams. Medical and operational resources, biosecure bubbles and broadcast offerings were all treated the same for arguably the first time in history, England women’s games would be delivered on the same footing as the men’s. The women’s international fixtures remain under negotiation, but confirmation of a visiting team is expected soon.Meanwhile the eight new regional hubs created by the ECB’s action plan last year will play their first domestic games this weekend – exactly when they were always intended to. The format of this year’s domestic competition is a one-off, with the Rachael Heyhoe-Flint Trophy mirroring the men’s Bob Willis Cup in its regional-group structure. Clare Connor, the governing body’s managing director of women’s cricket, says that, because of the limitations imposed by coronavirus, their domestic men’s and women’s cricket operations are the most integrated they have ever been.“I’ve never felt more confident than this summer about the growing importance of the women’s game and its standing to be treated equally,” says Connor. “The standards of delivery, medical protocols, even the fact that we’ll be chartering flights for any opposition teams who come over to play – that’s a multimillion pound investment.”Connor says that, contrary to fears, there has been a “very determined attitude and appetite” to maintain momentum in the professionalisation of women’s cricket. Full-time domestic contracts for 40 players are still planned to come into effect from 1 October and 25 regional retainers, reportedly worth £1,000 a month, were put in place during lockdown.Connor is not the only person who sees a golden opportunity for a more gender-neutral game in the aftermath of Covid-19. This month, Simon Hughes and IPL owner Manoj Badale publish a book called A New Innings. As it searches for business strategies that could help cricket out of the crisis, it makes a strong argument that women should be at the centre of these.“I can’t stress enough how important female engagement is,” he says. “The pandemic has increased the importance of the amateur club as a centre of community, providing everything from yoga to book clubs. So the more women and girls you can include in that offer the more the game will strengthen in numbers.” Perhaps cricketing history is about to get a new chapter.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

Thanks for your company and comments to this point I’ll be back in 40 to get through those I’ve not yet got through, and for the inspection that will hopefully result in some cricket. “On Nasser’s ‘Cut away, Cut away’ moment,” says Fergus Pickles, “it’s not so much biblical as heroic and epic in the truest literary sense, invoking the dactyllic meter favoured by Homer and also used so famously in Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade: ‘Half a league, Half a league Half a league Onward All in the valley of death Rode the six hundred’.”It is certainly that, but can it not be both? “I remember it well,” says Rich Harding of his 25 August 2019. “I was cruising my narrowboat up the Trent and Mersey Canal, through Preston Brook tunnel, and onto the Bridgewater Canal. It was around the time that I got onto the Bridgewater that 5 Live went over to the live commentary on Sports Extra - I normally cruise with my AM radio, so was just getting updates to that point. I can vividly remember passing various people asking for news, and letting out an almighty roar at the climax, somewhat disturbing a towpath barbecue.As an aside, Ads and Colin, the two guys in the bubble who run the electronic site screens  boards, are also both narrowboaters, and very good friends of ours. Colin’s the one with the dreads.”What I’m loving about these accounts is how they capture what Christopher Moltissanti termed “The regularness of life”. He was complaining about it, but the beauty of a sport which takes place over such a long period is how it twizzles itself around all that we are. “Sitting by the shores of Lake Titicaca,” says Kieran Donoghue of his whereabouts a year ago. “Had checked out but hung around the hotel to use the Wi-Fi and follow the match on Guerilla cricketthe OBO. My wife was very patient – fortunately we had several hours to kill before our bus to La Paz so there was no rush.”Tangentially, what’s the longest bus ride you’ve ever done or, put another way, can anyone beat 56 hours, from Lencois in Salvador, Brasil, to Iguacu Falls? “A year ago I was at a dire La Liga game watching RCD Mallorca lose 1-0 to Real Sociedad,” emails David Jacob. “Cricket on my headphones. Many bemused Spanish football supporters wondering why I was cheering randomly.”“Memories, misty watercoloured mem’ries,” muses James Debens. “I was following the OBO on my iPhone, walking laps of my father-in-law’s Peugeot that he parks in his kitchen on the eastern coast of Spain. My wife and her family were chatting at the table, slightly confused by my striding, but our two King Charles iels were following my circuits as I clocked up my daily 20k. Alas, our beloved Bentley passed away of lymphoma 12 weeks ago, but I have the happy memories of that day. In fact, if play begins, I might put on those bright yellow Converse again and do laps of the dining table to recreate the good vibes and will on Jimmy’s 600th. My brother-in-law has only ever followed two cricket matches: firstly, when England achieved the highest ever team ODI score against Pakistan in 2016, posting 444-3 and last year’s Stokes-does-Hulk-smash wonder game in the Ashes. So David must think that cricket is part of the Marvel universe.”But what does he think about bright yellow Converse? “Over the years I’ve tried to introduce cricket to my (Italian) partner’s friends and family, starting with the Ashes series that was available live on the ECC Youtube channel in 2013,” says Mike Barron. “They gave up any interest last year as I sat with them (but not with them at all, if you get my drift) at a gelateria in Francavilla al Mare, shouting along with the OBO on my phone, until finally doing a strange jig around the tables, my partner sadly offering the only apology required…. ‘E Inglese…!’”“This time last year I was in a French campsite having just completed my stint as part of a team taking part in a 24-hour cycling race around the Le Mans circuit. My equally knackered teammates (who weren’t quite as absorbed or obsessed by the cricket as I was) didn’t really appreciate my getting increasingly distracted by the radio as we edged closer and closer throughout the afternoon, especially when I was supposed to be helping take down the tent.I twigged with about half an hour left that there was another British group sitting nearby, also listening to TMS and getting excited. As their radio appeared to be about 20 seconds behind I tried not to react too loudly when each boundary was scored or when Lyon fluffed the runoutburned the review and had the LBW turned down. I failed to keep very quiet when that final four was scored, though. I can only hope for their sake they hadn’t twigged that we were also listening and that they thought I was just really excited about getting the tent and all its poles back in the bag.”In fairness, that is an invigorating moment. “Cut away, cut away” also reminds me of this. The lyrics have certainly changed in my bathtub renditions. “After yesterday’s glorious trip through cricket and literature I was going to hold fire today,” confesses Pete Salmon, “but your suggestion that ‘Cut away, cut away for four’ has a Biblical feel has dragged me back. It’s an example of parallelism – the Lord himself tends to use it, and if its good enough for Him. You’ve got your synonymous parallelism, your antithetic, your formal, your synthetic and your emblematic. Nasser’s is synthetic I think, but I have to check my Robert Alter translation of the Bible to be sure, to be sure. Sits up next to the Wisdens obviously.”My favourite translation is the JPS, but I wondered if Nasser’s bit was deliberately anaphoric or just him adapting to a change in circumstance as he realised the ball was going to the fence. “There’s probably about two hours before I really need to go to bed,” says Phil Withall, “so you may as well step out for a bite to eat and a cup of whatever  journalists are drinking these days.“Ten minutes after I have retired play will resume, Jimmy will then take his 600th wicket and I will awake tomorrow to the combination of elation and regret that have accompanied my cricketing life for so many years.”From your mouth to His ears. “I was watching while spending a couple of weeks with my Spanish family-in-law at their holiday home in a small village,” recounts Ewan McDonald. “No-one could quite understand how I had been following the same game for days, least of all my father-in-law as I tried to explain the rules in my middling Spanish.My wife, who has no interest in the sport, joined me for the last wicket partnership, and was literally leaping around the living room with excitement. What a day. Nothing’s better than Test cricket.”It’s not easy“I live in Edinburgh, and it’s normally festival time in August,” says David Jarman. “For final hour or so of That Test Match I was at the opera, with TMS playing in one earpiece. My heart swelled with the winning runs, I clenched my fists. I looked around to see everyone rapt in the drama of the moment as Wagner’s Ring Cycle headed towards its finale. I wiped some dust from my eye. Jimmy Anderson is great, isn’t he?”Heh, this reminds me of story. A few years ago, we lost a good mate of mine, and at the end of a dreadful week, I went to see Beyoncé as my wife is a huge fan (I have since been to Rome in order to do the same). Anyhow, the purchase of Personality Enhancer was extremely dear and extremely time-consuming, so little bottles of wine deposited into a pint pot made most sense. I was getting to end of my second and realised that my eyeballs were sweating, a fact not lost on the woman next to me, who leant over, put a hand on my shoulder, and said soothingly “Beyoncé’s great, isn’t she?”“Yesterday’s OBO erted into how difficult it is to get films featuring cricket financed,’ emails Jon Blair. “Well here’s a thing. For the last four years Michael Grade (yes, one and the same Lord Grade) and I (You can google me to see what I have done in the past) have been trying to get the finance together for a feature film based on Peter Oborne’s magnificent book about the political conspiracy to ensure Basil D’Oliviera wouldn’t get picked for the infamous England tour of South Africa in 1968. It is as much a story of racism at the highest levels of the MCC and the British establishment, as well as the mendacity of the then England captain along with the more predictable corrupt practices of the Powers-that-Were in the South African government, as it is a story of cricket, all set against the generational political changes of 1968, but here we still are without anyone prepared to finance it. Whether that is due to no appetite for a story featuring a cricketer at its heart, or something else I won’t ever know, but to say it is heartbreaking not to be able to tell this story on the big screen or even television is heartbreaking.”Yes, that sounds great, and I feel you. When we were thinking about cricketing stories that would translate well to the silver screen, this one immediately sprung to mind. On TMS last week, Manoj Badale, owner of Rajasthan Royals, was saying that cricket has a big opportunity in America because of the growing south Asian population, so perhaps that, along with the growing recognition of south Asia itself, might help. I hope so. “Gah,” says Sean Clayton. “I’ve now got the closing paragraph of your opening stuck in my head, to the tune of Alanis Morrisette’s ‘Thank U’. Worst of all, it almost, but doesn’t quite, scan. (I suppose I should be grateful that it’s not to the tune of the old Cadbury’s Roses advert).”We’re at Headingley, so I guess I can tangentially reference the song sung to the Roses tune when Leeds beat Arsenal to hand Manchester United the title in 2003. “Wow-wee! What are we witnessing here from Ben Stokes?!”“What a summer he’s having! What a cricketer he is!”“Watching the footage of that last hour from Headingley reminds me how different it all looks with a crowd in,” says Tim Stafford. “I have loved the cricket this summer but imagine how much better it would be again to see it played in front of packed houses or – even better – be helping to pack the house yourself. I had given up on the Headingley game after Woakes had fallen, and was at the pub for my friend’s birthday. With two kids I rarely get beyond the sofa these days but I decided that it was a good idea at 2pm to start drinking Sambuca. I remember Stokes’ century on the pub TV and have a hazy recollection of toasting the win with more Sambuca. We apparently ended up at a party hosted by Basement Jaxx where I fell over in the middle of everyone and broke my finger. I somehow made it home and my wife found me asleep on the kitchen floor next morning.” A contribution every bit as vital as that of Stokes and Leach, and I’m not even joking. “May I make a proposal for a more scientific approach to the start and finish times?” asks Kim Thonger. “Why are we fixated on a fixed start time? It’s not beyond the wit of man, although that may not apply to the ECB, to devise a variable start time through the summer months based on actual daylight hours and angle of sun’s rays, see marvellous sliding thingummibob here...”I think there’s something to be said for standardised times, but agree that when we’re chasing playing time, we need to be flexible and proactive. “I’d missed the previous day’s play, because we’d driven to Oxford to see friends,” says Nath Jones. “On the way back, the head gasket of my terrible old Corsa blew, in the outside lane of the M40. I rolled the car to the hard shoulder then convinced a heroic taxi driver to pick up my wife and kids and take them to the nearest tube station while I waited for the AA.The additional problem was that we were meant to drive said car to France on holiday about 36 hours later. I spent Saturday night finding the cheapest hire car, then listened to the beginning of Stokes’s innings while on a train to Gatwick on the Sunday to pick up the car. I listened to TMS while driving back to London (having convinced the car hire guy to give me a free upgrade to the biggest car they had), eventually giving up on radio, parking the car up, and watching the last hour on my phone, sat in a parking space somewhere near Croydon. Not how I would’ve imagined watching England’s greatest Test innings.”Siri, what is serendipity (apart from Stephen and Mark Gottlieb’s sister)?Hopefully we might get some play quite soon after that. “I was on the usual OBOTMS diptych,” says Guy Hornsby, “the best place to be. I got more and more tense so went into the garden then ended up driving down the road and listening in a garage on the Washway Road in Sale, celebrating by shouting on my own to odd looks. Cricket, the BEST.”This thing of ours. “I live in NZ and a year ago, I stayed up all night watching England’s increasingly improbable heroics,” says Martin Burley. “The match-winning shots were played barely in time for me to dash airportwards for an early-morning business trip. My contributions to the meetings that day were of dubious value, infused as they were with a heady concoction of euphoria, disbelief and sleep deprivation. My colleagues weren’t too fazed though, since I’d been in exactly the same state after a very similar trip following the World Cup final.” “Tally ho from Slovakia, where it is not raining, just so you know,” boasts George Brownwitheney. “I couldn’t hack it watching on the telly last year so I went and sat in a hedge with a tinny, under the guise of protecting my father’s farm from pigeons, with TMS playing from my phone and pretending I wasn’t listening. No pigeons were harmed, and I got sunburn. Thoroughly worthwhile.”This is it: Test-match cricket, turning sentients into scarecrows. With the thoughts that we’ll be thinkin’, we could be another Lincoln, if we only had a brain.“May I say a hearty thank you to you and all you colleagues on the OBO and Tanya and the CC Live team for your excellent coverage this summer,” says David Harris (no, not my dad). “Regarding the Headingley Miracle, my daughter and I were sat glued to the telly, willing every stroke away from Aussie fielders, praying for Tim Paine’s mitts to turn into Gloves of Clang. As Stokes ran out of partners, until the unflappable Jack Leach, we barely had any fingers left, forget about nails. And with crushing inevitability, just as she had in the World Cup Final earlier in the summer, my wife came home from work and started bustling about. ‘I’ll make some food, what do you want? Who’s winning? What’s the score? How long’s left?’ All the standard, non-cricket fan questions. ‘Be. Quiet.’ we hissed. Then the burned review. Lyon’s dropped run-out. Jack’s one (oh, what a One). And then the joy. Marvellous. Enjoy the ODIs and T20s later in the ‘summer’, and maybe we might get some limited attendance at the Blast later. Who knows.”I think this is my favourite bit.“I had recently moved to the Netherlands and was enjoying a day at my local beach,” says Tom Paternoster-Howe. “My wife and daughters were in the water, cooling off because it was about 30 degrees in the shade. Meanwhile, I, who would normally be splashing about in the lovely cold North Sea, was glued to my phone reading the OBO. Every refresh of the screen, I was sure was going to bring news of a wicket \u0026amp, ultimately, heroic failure. It was exquisite torture, with the happiest of endings.”A beach in the Netherlands! They’ll have one in Paris next. Rob Robkey is taking us on a walk around the square, and there’s still a fair bit of standing water about. The middle is worse than the outfield, but it’s not raining anymore, and he reckons that if that stays the case, we might get three hours. In other words, it’s perfectly set up for a burst of pure, uncut SJ Broad.“I was in southern Spain for my brother’s wedding a few days later,” emails Nick Donovan. “La Vuelta de Ea was passing through our town, so I went down with my Dad to see them pass through – quickly, obviously – while following on Cricinfo. With the crowd all checking phones for when the cyclists would arrive, the signal dropped with England needing 80 or so (I think). As it was baking hot, and my Dad is an old man, we stopped in an Irish bar to treat ourselves to a Guinness. When I walked in, I assumed it would be over, but England needed 12...”Down like silk. “You’re right to highlight what an extraordinary achievement it has been from everyone involved to enable us to have test match cricket this summer,” writes Robin Durie. “We owe a particular debt of thanks to the West Indies and to Pakistan for making this possible. They have proven to be two very likeable teams – both led by impressive and decent captains – who have contributed greatly to a pair of enjoyable and often exciting series. Let’s hope the ECB is able to reciprocate in the future, \u0026amp to support the ongoing development of West Indies and Pakistani test match cricket.”“Will we be seeing Yasir Shah in this country again?” asks John Starbuck. “Like Lionel Messi, whom he resembles, you can sense an era passing.”I hope not but I’m not sure – it doesn’t much look like his enthusiasm’s waning. A few days ago, Michael Holding said that one morning, he woke up, looked out of the window and thought nah, don’t fancy it, so retired that day. Yasir will do what’s best for him, and if he stays fit I think he might hang about for another four or five years, especially now that Tests are returning to Pakistan. “I was on holiday in France with my parents and my (Italian) wife’s family,” recalls James Appleton. “It was the last day and we’d packed up to go to the airport, but our departure was delayed as the English contingent sat out in the garden shouting at TMS – much to the bafflement of my in-laws.”A parents and parents in-law double-header, goodness me. I think we may have found our person who appreciated Ben Stokes the most. “Yep, the weather here in Hampshire is filthy,” says Luke Richardson. “One year ago, I was stood with my children in unbelievable heat at Eurodisney, watching the tea-time parade. An hour or two before I’d given up on the OBO but thought I’d sneak a look to see how bad it had been. Hope had done one. I spent the next half-hour barely noticing the amazing floats, or my children, as I frantically kept refreshing before the battery on my phone gave up. ‘You must have enjoyed that parade,’ said my wife noticing my cheerfulness. When we got home, I could not stop watching the re-runs and even this morning found myself reciting Nasser: “Cut away, cut away for four … what a player … etc and so on”. Atherton’s disbelieving ‘What a shot that is’ for the reverse sweep six also sticks in the memory.”I’m slightly obsessed with rhythm of the “cut away, cut away”. It’s biblical really, given that a repeating word changes “Thou shalt” to “Thou shalt surely”. “I’m sorry but I’m not having it,” chunters Geoff Wignall. “‘... Best television programme that ever was’ indeed. That was Bagpuss. I’m not suggesting this as a suitable rabbit-hole down which to take the OBO. Oh no.”I was more of a Mr Benn man, but I concede that there’s something compelling about a furry cat that looks like Battenberg. “A year ago today,” says Tom Rebbitt, “I was outside my daughter’s ballet lesson in Gothenburg lying on the grass in the sun and shouting at TMS to the amusement of the passing Swedes. Especially at Glenn McGrath….”“At the risk of adding to the 10:30 start chat,” says Chris Lingwood, “why does test cricket start at 11? Especially since we have such horrible trouble with light! Why can’t they just get cracking at 10 or earlier? Think of all the cricket that would have given us over the last few weeks. I’d gladly get up earlier if I was heading to the ground.”I guess people coming from far away have more time to arrive, and because we have long evenings, we can give the dew time to dry. “I distinctly remember where I was this time last year,” says Michael Robinson. “Having watched all of the first two days of England getting battered, I went to North Wales to climb and pretend cricket didn’t exist. I was up on the Idwal Slabs above Cwm Ogwen belaying my friend following the OBO (obviously), unsure how I had sufficient signal.Obviously the pulsating game has me on edge when I maybe should have been concentrating on the climber, but you can’t have it all. I watched as the score crept up, until Leachy was on strike, 1 to draw, 2 to win, then the ropes went tight and I hear “CLIMB WHEN READY”. By the time I’d followed up the route my phone had died and it took my two more hours to find out what had happened. Nightmare.Incidentally it’s bright in Manchester and I feel that again if they’d hosted the match here we’d be playing sooner rather than later, and would’ve got a full day in yesterday.”Yes, agreed. That’s the problem with Tests in the south as opposed to Tests in M16: you can’t trust the weather. “I took my son to watch the mighty Northants beat Warwickshire at Edgbaston in the T20 Blast on the day of Ben Stokes’ (and Jack Leach’s) heroics,” says Steven Pye. “The oohs and ahhs coming from the concourse below kept us aware of the progress of that last wicket partnership.The groan and subsequent cheer accompanying Nathan Lyon’s slight fumble will live with me forever. Of course, we were tempted to go and watch the action on the screens below, but being a slightly pathetic cricket fan I told my son that we’d lose if we left our seats. At the end of it all, I have to admit that I did have something in my eye.”It’s a funny one, isn’t it, because England winning didn’t exactly mean anything in the grand scheme of things ... except it meant everything in the grand scheme of everything, a reminder of how good things can be and the unbelievably moving experience of someone realising themselves, after experiencing industrial quantities of doubt, in front of our eyes. “Wot, no fisticuffs?!” asks Brian Withington. “Whatever happened to a single 10:30am start in a Test battered by the elements? Remarkable. On a more collaborative note, for some reason your preamble had me reaching for this.” Bill Sykes is up there with my most terrifying villains of all-time. “We’d gone down to see my parents who don’t have Sky,” tweets Miranda Jollie, “assuming nothing much was going to happen, ended up huddled with my husband and dad around TMS in the garden, while my mum supplied beer and ice cream.”I like beer and ice cream. Athers and Wardy – yes, we’re on nickname terms – are discussing the absence of a crowd. And it’s important that, when reflecting on how much we’ve enjoyed a summer we didn’t think we were getting, we don’t forget that sport is not a television programme – though it is the best television programme that ever was. Where were we all? I was extremely stressed, sat in an editing suite with a fantastic and heroic editor, who did not have the slightest interest in the cricket I was sneakily watching on his blind side. And Oliver has the same idea. “It’s a year since Jack Leach’s match winning 1*,” he says. “Might I suggest, given the rain, that we spend an hour reliving it on the OBO?”“The outfield is absolutely a bog,” says Ian Ward, before referring us directly to Headingley a year ago today. Sight for sore eyes:“You did miss someone,” emails Mark Hooper. “Thank you OBO staffers for making us laugh and argue over obscure facts and occasionally make us feel like we have something in our eye.”Your pleasure is our pleasure. Not great news, I’m afraid: the Rose Bowl is wet, and likely to remain thus for the morning session. There is, though, a reasonable prospect of cricket this afternoon, potentially for long enough for England to force a win, and at the very least for James Anderson to hit 600. In the meantime, stick with me here and while away away the hours, conferring with the flowers, consultin’ with the rain. And our heads we’ll be scratchin’ while our thoughts are busy hatchin’, while we’re waiting for some play. Round these parts, we spend quite a lot of time talking about how much we love this thing of ours that we love so much: why we love it, how we love it, what that love means. That loving it is really part of loving ourselves, however strange and unpalatable that sometimes feels. To each other at least, we are wholly known. Well, we are now, because “all this” has shown us an entirely different aspect to everything we thought was true: you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone ... and come back. Over the course of this Test-match summer, we’ve been part of two wonderful series played by three wonderful teams ... and yet it’s not really that is it, rather the simple knowledge that our friend, our teacher and our love is there with us and for us, caring for us, sustaining us and detaining us precisely when we’ve needed it most. And now this is it. So, thank you West Indies. Thank you Pakistan. Thank you England. Thank you umpires. Thank you ECB. Thank you Sky. Thank you BBC. Thank you broadcasting staff. Thank you groundstaff. Thank you medical staff. Thank you medical experts. Thank you hotel staff. Thank you Lancashire. Thank you Hampshire. Thank you anyone i’ve forgotten.

For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2fe19fd67bca653c753499a8cadf6d48eaffd/0_0_4893_2936/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a66804da8d76926a240da37d432a04","title":"hybrid cars have to be plugged in and five other common misconceptions","story":"Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9f2191029e5033edacd0e10f21cc1f48d654563/1386_1800_3526_2116/master/3526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcd005d88e378c8b805305f897f38f6b","title":"quiet as a deserted chapel test driving a hybrid car","story":" Mike Pattenden and his wife Andrea Walker take the Honda CR-V hybrid out for a spin. Here’s what they discover …Despite being the self-conscious subjects of a photoshoot in the busy car park in Bedfordshire’s Dunstable Downs, no one paid a blind bit of notice to us. Clearly, as a couple, my wife and I were as commonplace to the families, walkers and kite flyers up there on a breezy Sunday morning before lockdown as the Honda CR-V hybrid that was actually the quietly unassuming star of every shot.There were plenty of SUVs in view, even a few other Honda CR-Vs – hardly surprising, given it’s the world’s most popular SUV. More than 9m have been sold since it was launched back in 1995.When it comes to cars, “popular” is a good thing. It means dependable, safe and cheap to run and, consequently, as eye-catching as denim. And yet, this fifth-generation model of the CR-V is remarkable in its own way. It’s a hybrid with an engine that combines the best aspects of petrol combustion and electric to power it.Our CR-V is powered via a combination of a 2.0-litre Atkinson-cycle engine and two electric motors via Honda’s integrated motor assist (IMA) system, meaning it runs in three modes: EV, hybrid and petrol, constantly defaulting to electric at speeds below 30mph. In this mode, the electric motors are used to drive the wheels, using energy from the battery that was previously harvested from the petrol engine while driving at higher speeds. This means the petrol engine is generally used at lower revs, making it more fuel efficient and quieter.And, golly, is it quiet. Honda’s noise-cancelling system makes it feel like a deserted chapel as we drive around this Sunday morning, albeit one with heated pews.“You’d hear a squirrel squeak if you ran over one,” observes my wife as we drive stealthily over to Ivinghoe Beacon, where we like to walk at weekends. Luckily, no such tragedy occurs. Honda’s cross-traffic sensor warns me of a jogger as I begin to reverse (I spot him a moment later in the handy rear camera), and the CR-V hybrid has a collision detection system that prevents a rear-end shunt by slamming on the anchors for you. Having recently endured a trip to Bristol in horrendous stop-start motorway traffic, aggravated by a succession of these infuriating incidents, I’d make this feature mandatory in every car.As for efficiency, the car shifts modes seamlessly, meaning it’s incredibly thrifty, capable of 56mpg in town. You can have fun stretching its electric running, too, through regenerative braking via two paddles behind the steering wheel that slow it like changing down gears in a manual, although, given its powertrain, the CR-V hybrid is an automatic. And because of the way it tops up the batteries, there’s no recharging, so no “powernoia” on long journeys.“You don’t really have to do much, do you?” says my wife approvingly, when she takes the wheel. “I could get used to this.”On the motorway, the car switches to petrol mode at high speed and proves adept at eating up the miles in comfort. There’s a suite of driver-assist features including adaptive cruise control that will adjust distance to the car ahead, lane-keep assistance, in case you wander, and a speed limiter that will automatically maintain a specified speed – handy for the inevitable 50mph surveillance sections. For someone who views a future of driverless cars as dystopian, this level of autonomy feels perfectly acceptable to me.Inside, it’s roomy and well supplied with storage points. The centre console swallows my wife’s chunky handbag whole. There are cup holders for coffee addicts and bottle racks in the door pockets, along with charge points for phones.The boot is roomy enough for a dog. Put the rear seats down and you could probably fit a Shetland pony in. Shell out for the top-of-the-range EX model and it’s also automated, meaning you can open it by waggling your foot underneath, handy for the big shop. All but the most basic models boast a centre console with a 7in touchscreen. I had the radio set to 6 Music within a couple of minutes and the sound from the nine speakers was impressive. You can use its Garmin navigation system or set up a smartphone instead, if you wish.CR-V stands for “compact recreational vehicle”, but perhaps “considerately reinvented vehicle” is a better fit?Honda has raised the ambition of its Electric Vision strategy to ensure that all European mainstream models feature electrified powertrains by 2022, three years earlier than originally planned.

The World of Wine (Wow), which opened on 31 July, celebrates the millennia-old love affair with oenology, while signalling Portugal’s confidence as a wine-making nation of note. Wedged like a multi-tiered wedding cake up the sloping southern bank of the River Douro, the city’s new “cultural district” announces itself with aplomb. With six museum spaces of immersive exhibits (the Wine Experience even has mock alleyways with fake sky), big-screen videos and interactive kids’ games, the project aims to educate and entertain. There are also restaurants, cafes, bars, and numerous shops.Wow is spearheaded by the Fladgate Partnership, one of half a dozen or so wineries that dominate the country’s wine industry. Behind the big brands, however, the world of Portuguese wine remains erse and highly localised. How to get a real-life taster? Step off the tourist trail. Here’s our pick of the best ways to explore wine regions across the country. Unless you’re abstemious, it’s not ideal to be the designated driver on a vineyard tour. Far better to swap four wheels for two and discover Portugal’s wine country by bike. Crisscrossed with a network of well-established cycle paths, the Amarante region, home of Portugal’s signature vinho verde, is a great place to start. One of the best runs is along an old railway line through the grape-strewn Tâmega valley, north-east of Porto, starting in the pretty village of Arco de Baúlhe and finishing in the cobble-paved town of Amarante. Local tour agency Amarantrilhos arranges a one-day excursion along the route, with a transfer from Amarante (€48, max 6 people) and bike hire (€16). For a halfway treat of lunch and a wine-tasting (€35), book a spot (via A2Z tour agency) at the picturesque Quintas das Escomoeiras estate. Owner Fernando Fernandes offers an on-request explanation of the wine-making process (€25). A2Z also organises extended hiking trips in the area. • amarantrilhos.ptFor British wine-drinkers of a certain age, the word “Mateus” evokes nostalgia for flared trousers, bubble perms and cheese fondue. Sitting in 1970s drinks cupboards alongside the wonders that were Blue Nun, Liebfraumilch and Babycham, Mateus Rosé brought pizzazz to many a suburban drinks party. It’s as fondly remembered for its flask-shaped bottle and the label featuring a magnificent stately home as its frizzante contents. Welcome to Casa de Mateus near Vila Real, east of Porto, which, despite boasting its own ancient winery, bears no direct relation to Portugal’s famous pink export. Even so, as a prime example of Portuguese baroque architecture, it is worth a visit. Dating to the early 18th century, this one-time home of the counts of Mateus contains fascinating exhibitions and original decor, as well as fabulous gardens. A wine tasting is available on request (€10-€20). • €13 (children, €6.50), casademateusPortugal may boast fine grapes and wine-makers, but arguably its greatest contribution to the world of wine is the cork oak tree. The country is still home to one third of global cork production, the epicentre of which is the savannah-like province of Alentejo. To see these ancient gnarly cork oaks close up, the cork and wine producer Herdade da Maroteira offers a leisurely hiking tour of its 540-hectare farm near the historic city of Évora. In the company of local expert José, the walks include a stop-off at a megalithic tomb and a hilltop picnic (with goodies such as Altentejano cheese, Iberian black pork and Maroteira wine). For the less mobile, a 4x4 can be taken. Agro-ecological tour specialist Portugal Farm Experiences organises a similar half-day cork tour, also near Évora (from €39). • From €55 with lunch,corktrekkingOf the 1,115 miles of Portugal’s Atlantic coast, the Setúbal peninsula is one of the wildest and most beautiful, with miles of beaches, sandy-orange cliffs, beach bars and grass-tufted dunes.

Explore the beaches (or surrounding mountains) on lusitano horses before a post-ride tasting at the beach-side stables of the smooth, exuberant wines for which the region is famed. • Horse riding + wine tasting from €65 picnic (€30) or private lunch (€35-€50) also available, children welcome, passeiosacavalomelidesThe life of the farmhand is in no way glamorous, but, with the sun on your back and the whiff of sea air in your nostrils, it isn’t without upsides. Other plus points include the chance to work alongside locals, learn about wine-making first hand and practise your Portuguese (vinhedo – vineyard uva – grape estou exausto – I’m done in). Long-standing organic wine producer Monte da Casteleja provides board and lodging to anyone willing to lend a hand through the WWOOF volunteering network. Working alongside owner Guillaume and chief wine-maker Rui and their small team, it’s a half-day onhalf-day off arrangement. Tasks range from weeding and pruning through to bottling and harvesting. Inland from Lagos, the beach is five minutes away. • WWOOF membership €20, wwoof.ptIn central and south Portugal particularly, the sight of grapes on the vine usually means there are olives on the branch close by. Both fruits thrive in the region’s warm, dry conditions, though olives tend to mature shortly after the grape harvests (in autumn and late summer, respectively), thus fitting neatly into farmers’ diaries. In the Museu do Azeita (Olive Oil Museum) near Oliveira de Hospital, visitors are treated to a celebration of all things olive-esque. In a modern building shaped like an olive tree branch, the museum’s ground floor has a collection of artefacts illustrating olive oil’s history and heritage. Upstairs is a panoramic restaurant with a menu of olive- and olive-oil-inspired dishes and views over the Serra da Estrela mountain range. The brainchild of veteran olive-oil maker António Dias, the museum also has a store that sells the oils, including Dias’s brands, and wines from across the Beira region.• Admission €5, museudoazeiteHome to the Touriga Nacional vine (the primary component of port wine), Dão’s temperate climate and mountainous terrain makes for highly tannic, full-bodied wines. A new wave of wine-makers is changing things with fruitier, fresher, more sophisticated offerings. Most of these are independent, small-scale affairs, so the best way to check them out is by visiting one of the region’s regular wine fairs. Two of the best take place in the cities of Nelas and Viseu in September (suspended this year due to Covid-19). The Roman town of Viseu also holds an annual combined book-and-wine festival. Now in its sixth year, previous speakers at the three-day Tinto no Branco event have included Jonathan Coe, Michael Palin and Joanne Harris. • 6-8 December 2020, tintonobranco.ptBarely a century after the formation of Portugal in the 12th century, the first cork was wedged into a bottle of Taboadella wine, back in 1255. To prove its heritage, the 40-hectare vineyard in Satão has an ancient grape press set in a monolithic rock. That said, new owners (the Amorims, a four-generation family of wine-makers) have recently given the site a makeover, bringing the latest kit and viniculture know-how to the venture. On a plateau in the Dão region, Taboadella’s doors are open for a range of tours (from €12), tastings (from €12), sit-down meals (from €35) and even a “winemaker for the day” option (€85). This short course includes insights from Taboadella’s master wine-makers on the art of blending, as well as batch testing, corking and bottle labelling. • taboadella"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1199f987999f45a5f91b7e208570ac216edc2bb7/0_91_4920_2952/master/4920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=994f279ec85dec726d53140b911cb738","title":"with a word of tamil kamala harris boosts her fanbase in india","story":"Pride in US VP candidate particularly strong in Tamil Nadu village where her grandfather was bornAs a child wandering between the legs of the aunts, uncles and family friends who filled her grandparents’ apartment in Chennai, in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, a young Kamala Harris grew used to being addressed in Tamil.It was the main language spoken by her grandmother, who had only fragmented English, and over the years of Harris’s childhood trips from California to Chennai – which back then was called Madras – to visit her mother’s side of the family, she slowly learned to understand, if not speak, the mother tongue of her Indian relatives.Standing at the Democratic convention podium last week accepting her historic nomination for US vice-president, Harris made a passing but significant nod to this aspect of her heritage. She said her mother had “raised us to know and be proud of our Indian heritage”, adding: “Family is my uncles, my aunts and my chithis.”Harris is the first candidate of Indian descent to be on a US presidential ticket, and her use of chithi, the Tamil term of endearment meaning “auntie”, sent reverberations through south Asian households in the US and also those watching 8,000 miles away in India.“I literally have tears in my eyes,” tweeted the model and chef Padma Lakshmi, who like Harris’s mother was born in Chennai and moved to the US. “Kamala Harris just said ‘chithis’ which means auntie. My heart is so full right now.”Harris’s use of Tamil in her speech has boosted her growing fanbase in India, particularly in the tiny eastern Tamil Nadu village of Painganadu where her grandfather PV Gopalan was born in 1911 and which Harris visited once as a child with her grandmother.In the past week posters have appeared all over the village, emblazoned with Harris’s face and bearing slogans expressing local pride, wishing her good luck and describing her as “lion-hearted”.Bharathi Selvam, 27, whose grandfather knew Harris’s grandfather, was among those in Painganadu who organised for the posters to be hung up in the village tea shop and on every lane. “It is a very proud moment for us,” he said. “We have all become very active, everyone has put up signs supporting her and started reading about American politics. We have all been offering prayers for her, so I am sure she will win.”Harris’s Indian side of the family still send financial donations to the Dharma Shastra temple in the village, and her name, alongside those of her relatives, is carved into the temple wall. The temple’s administrator SV Ramanam, 71, said Harris’s aunt Sarala Gopalan had asked him to perform a small prayer ritual to offer good luck for her niece. “The villagers are very elated at this news,” said Ramanam.Harris’s mother, Shyamala Gopalan, left India aged 19 after being offered a part-funded PhD at the University of California, Berkeley. According to Harris and her Indian relatives, Shyamala ensured that her two daughters did not lose touch with their Indian heritage despite growing up in America.Every few years Shyamala, who worked as a cancer research scientist and was also a renowned singer of traditional Carnatic music, would bring her daughters to Chennai to visit her retired grandparents, and Harris would take formative walks with her grandfather along the beach. Harris was not able to come back to India for the funeral of her grandfather, who died suddenly in 1999, but she returned to Chennai beach to scatter the ashes of her mother, who died of cancer in 2009.In a speech last week at a “South Asians for Biden” event, Harris spoke of her times in Chennai. “Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry,” she recalled. “And of course, she always wanted to instil in us a love of good idli.”Harris’s bonds with the Indian side of her family have remained tight and they all flew out to Washington for her inauguration as a senator in 2017.“We are naturally very proud,” said Harris’s uncle G Balachandran, 79, who lives in Delhi. “This has brought great happiness to us all in her family.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce652cfdda332049fd2a6d5fa9b5aa27cdb41bae/411_627_5035_3021/master/5035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4b0f9f1a7d025860088935d452de379","title":"dear christchurch breiviks trial showed us extremist ideas struggle in the light","story":"A 10-week trial of Anders Breivik afforded him publicity, and underground infamy, but the openness benefited the victims tooTerror wouldn’t work if no one wrote about it. Terrorists crave our attention, our anger and our tears. Norway and New Zealand have both been struck by attacks from violent extremists inspired by ideas from the same root – white supremacy and Islamophobia – but the two countries have chosen different paths in how to deal with it. Norway chose openness and full exposure, while the case around the Christchurch shooter seems dimly lit.In 2011, the then Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, sat in his home office to work on a speech he was going to give the following day at the summer camp of the Labour party youth when a loud bang sounded. Anders Breivik had dressed as a police officer and detonated the bomb outside the prime minister’s office in downtown Oslo, killing eight. He then travelled to the island of Utøya where the camp would be held and shot and killed 69 people, mostly teenagers.Smiling, he called Norway’s special forces his brothers, according to leaked transcripts of police interviews, and urged them to join his so-called revolution. The third phase of his terror act had started: the propaganda phase.When the prime minister spoke to the nation after the attacks, he called for “more democracy, more openness, more humanity. But never naivety”, to show the terrorist he couldn’t change us or break us.And openness we got. His face was everywhere, his name was everywhere, my editor told me to dig up everything I could find “on that man”. We approached his family, his classmates, neighbours, we studied his manifesto, the different groups he linked to, the leaked psychiatric reports, all with a slight guilt that we were more interested in him than in the victims.The trial should crown his propaganda phase, according to his manifesto. Writing it was phase one. Committing the terror act was phase two, before the third and final phase: “Your trial will offer you a stage to the world” he wrote.The dilemma was clear: our beloved openness contributed to spreading his message. The judge, prosecutors and lawyers struggled to find the right balance. After strong reactions from the bereaved, the press started to think twice before putting the terrorist on the cover. Yet as soon as the trial started, pictures of Breivik in an elegant suit and silk tie performing a Nazi salute were everywhere.Was this the picture that inspired the terrorist now being sentenced in New Zealand?Did Norway, with our tremendous hunger for openness, tolerance and humanity, inspire more terrorists? Was it wrong to give him a stage and let him speak during the trial?Professor Tore Bjørgo, who appeared as an expert witness in court, believes Tarrant was inspired more by the manifesto than the court proceedings. The director of Oslo University’s center for research on extremism puts Breivik into a fascist context and explains how extremists meet online, inspire and cheer each other on. The number of people Breivik was able to kill is what gives him status.Cathrine Grøndahl, a lawyer who represented several of the victims from the Labour party youth, said: “The trial was a way for us all to see the documentation of what really happened, in detail, at a time when memories were still fresh. A 10-week trial wasn’t necessary to get him convicted, but it was necessary for the victims, both to be able to tell what they had experienced, and to know more.” In order to find out whether Breivik was insane or not, the judge had to let him speak quite freely, she said.Lisbeth Røyneland lost her daughter Synne on the island. The 18-year old was among the last to be killed, and had hid for more than an hour when Breivik found her.Before the trial started, Lisbeth just wanted it to be over. She didn’t want to know anything, she couldn’t take any more. “There was so much media frenzy, pictures of the terrorist in all the papers.”But now she is glad the trial went so deeply into the matter. “The bereaved need to know what really happened and why,” she says. “Openness is key. You can’t handle a terrorist you don’t know. But can I tell you one thing? she adds. “There hasn’t been enough room for anger. It has been a bit too much kindness, to be honest, we have been so damned clever.” If the ideal is openness, even dark, ugly thoughts must be examined in broad daylight, where they cannot thrive. Just like the Norwegian trolls they turn into stones and grey mountains if they forget to hide before sunrise. Stones pose no danger. That is the Norwegian approach.

If we need to change the advice then of course we will.Asked why the UK government was ignoring World Health Organisation’s advice that children aged over 12 should wear masks, he said: The overwhelming priority is to get all pupils into school. And I think that the schools, the teachers, they’ve all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children’s health, the risk to children’s wellbeing from not being in school is far greater than the risk from Covid.If there are things we have to do to vary the advice on medical grounds, we will, of course, do that. But as the chief medical officer, all our scientific advisers, have said, schools are safe.The PM added he was “really pleased” by the work teachers had done to get ready to reopen from next week, a test of his government after it failed to return all children to schools earlier this year.Johnson, whose Conservative government has come under fire for how it has tackled education during the coronavirus crisis, said it was “crucial” for all children to return to school.For more updates from the UK, head over to the UK coronavirus live blog:A lockdown took hold in Gaza on Tuesday after confirmation of the first cases of Covid-19 in the general population of the Palestinian enclave, whose restricted borders have spared it from wide infection.Reuters reports that health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak.A government spokesman said four cases of the coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing into the coastal enclave from Egypt and Israel.Citing security concerns, both Egypt and Israel maintain tight restrictions at the Gaza frontier, leaving Gazans with little access to the outside world for years and hospitals often complaining of shortages in medical supplies.“What happens if one of us gets infected?” asked Khaled Sami, a Gaza resident. “When people are seriously ill, they send them into Israel, the West Bank or Egypt. Everything is closed now and who is going to open the gate for someone suffering from the coronavirus?”With businesses, schools and mosques ordered shuttered late on Monday for at least 48 hours, Gaza’s streets were largely deserted. But some people scrambled to buy essentials in groceries and bakeries, a limited number of which were open.“I hope the whole world can now help Gaza. We can’t resolve this issue on our own,” said another Gaza resident, who asked to be identified only as Abu Ahmed.Despite the lockdown, hundreds attended the funeral of four Islamic Jihad gunmen who died in an explosion in Gaza on Monday. The cause of the blast was not immediately disclosed.But in many places, only the sounds of home generators, used to make up for power cuts that can stretch up to 20 hours a day, could be heard.The health crisis came amid heightened tensions fuelled by the launching of sporadic rocket attacks and incendiary balloons at Israel, which has responded with airstrikes against Hamas positions.Gaza’s health ministry said the four Covid-19 cases were uncovered after a woman travelled to the West Bank, where she tested positive.The ministry said there have been 110 cases of the coronavirus inside border quarantine facilities and one death since the world pandemic began.Last month, the Gaza director of the World Health Organization, Abdelnaser Soboh, said the territory’s health system could deal with only 500 positive cases at one time. “A rapid turn for the better in the pandemic situation is unfortunately not in sight,” chief executive Topi Manner said in a statement.“Our revenue has decreased considerably, and that is why we simply must adjust our costs to our new size.”The job cuts will not apply to cabin and flight deck crew, Finnair said, although flying staff will remain on furlough “until further notice”.The vast majority of the airline’s 6,700 employees are on temporary layoffs.Alongside job cuts, the carrier will make other structural changes and on Tuesday updated its savings target from 80 million euros ($94m) to €100m.The company has been particularly hard hit by the drop-off in long-haul traffic, with flights between Helsinki and Asia a key part of the group’s growth strategy this past decade.The carrier released €500m-worth of shares in June to boost liquidity.Finland’s government further tightened coronavirus travel restrictions last week to become what it called the strictest in the EU, banning tourists from all but a handful of member states.Researchers tested 2,153 people in the southern town of Bad Feilnbach between 23 June and 4 July and found about 2.6 times more infections than previously reported. The town had to evacuate a nursing home for elderly people during the outbreak.Some people with Covid-19 are asymptomatic or only have mild symptoms, so antibody tests can help establish the true prevalence of the disease.The research is part of an ongoing study in towns in Germany, and the RKI said it would wait for further results before drawing broader conclusions.Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared with some other large European countries, but the number of new daily cases has been rising steadily since early July and has accelerated in recent weeks.The number of confirmed cases in Germany increased by 1,278 to 234,853, data from the RKI showed on Tuesday, while the reported death toll rose by five to 9,277.“The current developments should be taken seriously,” RKI epidemiologist Osamah Hamouda told the news conference, adding that the region near Bad Feilnbach had seen a jump in cases connected with people returning from trips abroad. The Spanish city of Zaragoza is believed to be the first in the country to have deployed a quarantine patrol, a team of 12 people who carry out home visits to make sure people are keeping quarantine.The north-eastern city is the regional capital of Aragon, where cases have surged in recent weeks. The 14-day rate of new infections sits at 441 per 100,000 in the region, according to the most recent data from Spain’s health ministry.The patrols, carried out in teams of two that include one social worker, were launched earlier this month. So far they’ve visited more than 100 homes, ferreting out more than a dozen cases where people have skipped out on quarantine.“We always get a nice welcome, they invite you in and everything,” one member of the team, Virginia Guillén, told Spanish newspaper El País. Working in tandem with health authorities, the team visits homes where people have been hard to track down by phone after testing positive or where there are concerns that quarantine may not be observed.The goal is to not impose controls, added Guillén, “but rather to check on why we someone has not been reached by phone and explain to them that we are here if they need anything.”Along with reinforcing the measures that must be put in place to protect family members from the virus, the patrols ensure that the home is large enough to allow for self-isolation. If not, residents are reminded that alternative accommodation is available to house asymptomatic cases.Two European patients were confirmed to have been re-infected with the coronavirus, according to regional public broadcasters, raising concerns about immunity.The news follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been re-infected four and a half months after recovering.Broadcasters said on Tuesday a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been re-infected with the virus.Dutch broadcaster NOS cited virologist Marion Koopmans as saying the patient in the Netherlands was an older person with a weakened immune system. “That someone would pop up with a re-infection, it doesn’t make me nervous,” she said. “We have to see whether it happens often.”Good morning from London.

Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work – your comments are always welcome!In the UK, a leading member of the Oxford University team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter.The trials ongoing around the world hope to involve around 50,000 people and he said if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials they could present data to regulators this year.It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine would most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after.Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford University, said: I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year. The potential vaccine, developed by Oxford University and drug company AstraZeneca, is thought to be the most advanced candidate in clinical trials. It is being tested on 10,000 people in the UK, and a further 10,000 in Brazil and South Africa. Scientists also hope to enrol 30,000 people in US trials.Following reports that US president Donald Trump wants to speed up approval of the vaccine in time for the November election, AstraZeneca said it had not discussed any fast-tracking with regulators.Indonesia reported 2,447 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases to 157,859, data from the country’s Covid-19 taskforce showed.The data recorded an additional 99 deaths, taking the total to 6,858, the highest Covid-19 death toll in south-east Asia. As the debate about wearing face masks continues around the world here’s an interesting story from Bloomberg about what happened in South Korea when one woman with coronavirus visited a Starbucks cafe north of Seoul earlier this month: more than two dozen patrons tested positive days later, but the four face mask-wearing employees escaped infection.Secondary school pupils in Scotland will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and on school buses from next Monday.Scotland’s education secretary, John Swinney, said the measure applies to all high schools but he added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask.This is not going to be mandatory. We are recommending this is what should be done and we will encourage schools to pursue that as part of the work to maintain safety within schools. It’s about making sure that everybody is looking out for each other.Yesterday, the Scottish government said that it had been consulting councils and teaching organisations about the measure after face coverings were recommended for secondary schools by the World Health Organization at the weekend.WHO said face coverings were useful where physical distancing between adults and pupils aged 12 and over was impossible, or in areas of high transmission.In England, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is being urged to impose the same measures, which he has thus far resisted. For more on that debate, please follow our UK coronavirus liveblog. The economic slump was much stronger than during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, and it represented the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970, the office said.The second quarter was a complete disaster. Regardless of whether it is about investments, private consumption, exports or even imports everything was in free fall.The German parliament has suspended the debt brake this year to allow the government to finance its crisis response and fiscal stimulus push with record new debt of €217.8bn.The German central bank expects household spending to drive a strong recovery in the third quarter, though the economy might not reach its pre-crisis level before 2022.The government’s stimulus measures include a temporary VAT cut from July to December worth up to €20bn, which Berlin hopes will give household spending an additional push.As officials across Spain wrestle with a surge in coronavirus cases, a chorus of voices is warning that another lockdown could have dire consequences for a country that just months ago emerged from one of Europe’s strictest confinements, reports Ashifa Kassam in Madrid.While cases of the virus have climbed across Europe, Spain has led the pack in recent days. More than 78,000 cases have been detected in the past two weeks, pushing the 14-day infection rate to 166 per 100,000, compared with 67 in France and 22 in the UK.Read the full story below:At the Republican convention in the US on Monday, President Donald Trump sought to distance himself from the impact of the coronavirus on the country and his administration’s handling of the crisis, referring to Covid-19 as the “plague from China”. Hong Kong is set to ease some coronavirus measures from 28 August, allowing venues such as cinemas and beauty parlours to reopen and restaurants to extend dining hours, authorities said on Tuesday. Reuters reports:Hong Kong had seen a resurgence of locally transmitted cases since the start of July but the daily number has fallen from triple digits in recent weeks to low double digits. Monday’s infection count of nine new cases was the lowest in nearly two months.Health secretary Sophia Chan said the government would allow outdoor sports centres to reopen and would lift mandatory mask wearing for outdoor sports and country parks. Restaurants would extend dining to 9pm having previously only been able to offer takeaways past 6pm.The government had imposed strict regulations at the start of July including the mandatory wearing of masks in all public outdoor places and a ban on gatherings of more than two people.The cap on the number of people that can meet would remain in place past Friday, and Chan gave no indication on when this would change.The relaxation of measures comes ahead of mass testing of residents in the Asian financial hub which is set to begin on 1 September. Since late January, about 4,700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 77 of whom have died.A Hong Kong man who recovered from Covid-19 was re-infected four-and-a-half months later in what is the first documented instance of human re-infection, researchers at the University of Hong Kong said on Monday. This is a great video from the Ugandan ministry of health about why social distancing matters. Good morning from London, where I’ll be looking after the global coronavirus live blog for the next few hours. My thanks (and solidarity!) to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Sydney. If you want to get in touch with stories from where you are please do. My email is alexandra.topping@the and I’m @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. Reuters has a fascinating story this morning on the scientific discoveries that are being made about Covid-19. They report:“Genetic barcodes” can help track how the new coronavirus spreads and mutates, researchers said on Saturday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Based on the sequence of the genetic code of the virus, the researchers identified 11 distinct SARS-CoV-2 “barcodes” that represent different clades, or lineages, descended from a common viral ancestor.Different continents have different variations, Arnab Pain of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia and his team found. The subtle differences in the genetic sequences represented by the barcodes may affect virus infectivity or illness severity, Pain noted.The researchers plan to regularly update the barcodes. “This is a dynamic process, and some virus cladessubclades may eventually die off in the future, and new clades may form,” Pain said.That’s it for me, Helen Sullivan, for today. I’m having four wisdom teeth yanked from my jaws tomorrow and won’t be blogging for a few days.My colleague Alexandra Topping will be taking you through the next few hours of pandemic news.

Photograph: iStockCrisp new shirts, smudge-free copies and a belly full of butterflies are the key ingredients for that first day back to school.This year, however, there will be an additional component behind the excitement of the new school year. For many, both parent and child, this day may now include an additional pinch of anxiety.While there are still unknowns about the logistics of school reopening, there are many ways in which parents can prepare their child for the return to the classroom.School is a very social space and it is important that children are reintroduced to socialising with other children before they return.Nóirín Hayes, expert in early childhood education at Trinity College, says children may become overwhelmed with the social aspect of school when they return if they have not met friends since March.“I certainly would encourage play dates within the boundaries of the guidelines because socialising on Zoom calls and social media is a bit different,” says Hayes.“Organise play dates with the other children from your child’s class so that the children are getting reacquainted with each other,” says Marian Quinn, chief executive of the Childhood Development Initiative. “If you are not happy to have children in your home then go the park so that your child is seeing other children and has the opportunity to play with other children in the playground.”Many children will have spent a lot of time in close proximity to their parents and it will be important for them to begin to spend some time apart from their parents before they return to school.“We know that there are lots of children who have not left their parents’ side for months,” says Quinn. “So, for those, there is going to be a real concern about separation anxiety.”This anxiety is as much a concern for the parent as it is for the child. “Some parents I know have relished the opportunity to be at home with the little ones in a way that they would never have been able to do, so they are going to miss being with their child every day,” says Quinn.She recommends having time apart from your child if possible. “Start looking to see if your child can go and stay with a friend for an hour. Gently start to have some time apart.”2. Talk the talkNever before has the topic of “back to school” been so robustly discussed and by so many, but including the children in the conversation can help ease any concerns they may have.“As parents what we need to do is talk to them about all the positives and the great things that will be there when they return to school, or indeed if it is their first time,” says Quinn.It is also important to be mindful of the conversations you may be having around the children.“Even if the children aren’t involved in the conversation, they are listening and they pick up on things like tone and body language in a way that we often underestimate in children,” says Quinn.“Children will pick up if we are anxious about them returning to school from the conversations that we have.”Clodagh Carroll, assistant director of children’s services at Barnardos, suggests suggests talking to your child about what may be different and acknowledging the worries they may have.“Talking to them and helping them understand that things that might be different will help,” says Carroll, “let them know it is okay for them to have worries and how they can talk to you about them.”3. Walk the walkWhether it is your child’s first day at primary school or they are returning for another year, walking the route to school before they return can help prepare them (and you) and ease the first day nerves.“Before they go back to school do the route with them,” says Carroll, “Little rituals like buying the lunch box or school bag signify a positive about getting ready to go back to school.”Hayes suggests looking at photos of the school or classroom on the school website and talking about the logistics of where they might stand in line.“Attending to the physical realities and the physical health and safety is something that we can all relate to,” says Hayes.4. Trust the teachers“What we have to do is trust our professionals to be professional and do the job that they were trained to do,” says Quinn.If you have noticed any concerning behaviour or are worried about a developmental delay, it is important to communicate this with the class teacher promptly.“Let the school know. It is so much easier for them if they know in advance,” she says.Some parents may be concerned about the re-emergence of school-refusal behaviours.“If you’re worried about school refusal, link in with the school as soon as you can and flag it,” says Carroll. “Find a teacher that had a good relationship with your child to encourage them back. Connect your child back in with that teacher before school starts to relieve that stress and anxiety.”Many parents may have concerns about children’s need to “catch up” academically, but Hayes explains that the first month of school should be viewed differently this time around.“We need to allow children time and space,” says Hayes “Of course children will be expecting to be learning things and to be taught but there needs to be a certain flexibility. Parents shouldn’t be disturbed if their children aren’t coming home with the same level of homework. It is no harm to think about the first month as a settling-in period.”While the return to school may go more smoothly than expected, Hayes says it is important for parents and teachers to be aware that issues may not present themselves straight away.“For many children there really is just the excitement of going back,” says Hayes. “So the issues may not happen in the transition.”She says it is important for parents to be mindful of changes in behaviour or sleep patterns that may happen in the weeks that follow the initial back-to-school period.“Self-care as a parent is one of the things that helps us be as good a parent as we can be,” says Quinn. “Being good to myself is not a selfish act.”She explains that it is really important for parents to take time for themselves. “It is what enables me to be the best parent I can be.”Carroll says it is important for parents to acknowledge how hard this has been for them. “There is something about parents saying “It’s okay, I did my best.”Back to school nerves?

Photograph: iStock“It is constantly in my head. It is a very anxious time,” says Tomas (to protect his identity we are not using his real name), a 60-year-old secondary school teacher ordered to return to work next week despite having cancer and a heart condition, which leave him at high risk of contracting Covid-19.Last week, he filled out the online risk assessment for returning to school, which he believed, because of his renal carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer for which he had part of his kidney removed last year, and his angioplasty and stent insertion, would allow him to work from home.As part of the process, he was asked for an up-to-date report from his consultant.“Let’s just say he’d prefer if I didn’t return to the workplace,” he said.Just days later a report was emailed back to him stating that he was simply “high risk” and not “very high risk”, so he would be expected at his desk when the school gates reopened.The only advice was to socially distance and take the appropriate hygiene measures.Bolt from blue“It was a bolt out of the blue, considering my conditions,” he said. “I do want to go back to work sometime but I don’t feel now is the appropriate time.”A teacher for 40 years, Tomas has been cocooning to protect himself at home since the start of the pandemic. His wife and two children, with whom he lives, have also been limiting their social contacts because of his illnesses.With his medical conditions, he has been “paranoid, anxious and cautious” about coronavirus.Now, faced with having to mix with large groups of children and adults in his school, where “space is very much limited”, he says a “plethora of worries” are weighing on him.“It’s not safe at the moment,” he said.“I’m particularly worried about the areas in the school that become congested at times.‘Lax with time’“I know we’ll all be very careful at the start, but people will get more lax in time. Kids are kids, and they have to be kids.”Break times are another concern, he says, adding that he is worried about the impact the stress will have on his ability to focus on his teaching.“Normally, when you go to work you just worry about work – now I have this other worry hovering over my head.“It seems to be a fait accompli.“My worst fear is that I will contract Covid and all the risks that go with that, even developing another serious illness from contracting it.

Video: RTE\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActing Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn during a press briefing at Government Buildings in Dublin. Photograph: Julien BehalPA WireThe State’s public health emergency team has issued a “note of caution” about rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in Dublin where people should take “extra care” to prevent spreading the virus.There were a further 147 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team, including 73 in Dublin. No further deaths were reported.This brings total confirmed cases to 28,116 with the death toll from the virus remaining at 1,777.Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn told a press briefing that there was not a major problem with rising cases in Dublin over the last number of days but that it was “something that we are watching closely.”“It is not an alarm it is simply a note of caution for people to take care and take all the basic measures,” he said, referring to the long-standing public health measures that people should follow and last week’s specific guidance to avoid house parties and other larger gatherings.The increased cases in Dublin were spread across the county but the number of infections were “slightly higher” in Dublin West, Dublin North West and Dublin North Central, he said.“Unlike what we saw in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, there isn’t one or two defined clusters guiding this in Dublin. It is spread out across areas, across settings, across workplaces and with a significant proportion of community transmission,” he said.One in three Dublin cases are from community transmission, which is higher than one-in-five national average. Some 34 of the 73 Dublin cases are close contacts of other Covid-19 cases.There was “no suggestion” that a county lockdown or any further restrictions were needed in Dublin and that if people followed guidance, the benefits would be seen next week, said Dr Glynn.Countrywide, there were 27 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals, including six in critical care units, and that this was up from 17 last Thursday. “We do need to monitor that very closely,” said Dr Glynn.He challenged claims from some commentators that the pandemic was now a “case-demic”, that public health officials should “stop worrying” and that “the virus has weakened.” “That is simply not the case,” he said. If cases kept rising, “it will only be a matter of time before it spreads into other groups,” he said.SchoolsDr Mary Favier, president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, acknowledged the anxiety amongst parents with schools reopening this week.She said parents should not worry about children who “have a runny nose for every single day of winter” but should “start to pay attention” when children have a high temperature, a cough or other respiratory symptoms and should keep them home for 48 hours until symptoms settle.Dr Glynn said it “won’t be a surprise” if there are cases among schoolchildren but the challenge was “to response to that appropriately and listen to the appropriate information sources.”There were 84 children under the age of 14 last week who tested positive for Covid-19 and overall children under 14 accounted for less than three per cent of cases.“The vast, vast majority who have Covid have very mild, if any symptoms,” he said.“If we can suppress this and keep this low in our community, we can protect our children and protect our education system.”Dr Glynn said he didn’t believe that it was possible to pursue a strategy to eliminate Covid-19 completely and that Nphet’s strategy was to “keep the cases as low as possible” and to protect education, vulnerable people and healthcare.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said that alternative testing methods were being evaluated for children, including saliva testing.Some 57,670 Covid-19 tests were conducted last week with a 1.3 per cent positivity rate.There were two new Covid-19 outbreaks reported at direct provision centres, in Bray and in Limerick and eight new cases spread over all eight outbreaks in these centres.Separately, another 10 cases of Covid-19 have been reported across Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours.There have been no more deaths.The first pupils have returned to schools across Northern Ireland since the coronavirus lockdown started in March. Some parents have expressed concerns while teachers’ unions say educators had not been given enough time to respond to rules issued earlier this month.Northern Ireland’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride has insisted it is safe to return.

The initial impact of Brexit was two price hikes of 10 per cent each, both caused by a fall in the sterling to euro exchange rate.But the impact on sales was virtually zero and a World Trade Organisation tariff of 7 per cent, which will apply to Silverhill goods entering the UK without a UKEU trade deal, doesn’t faze the company’s head of sales, Barry Cullen.“It’s not a major price difference,” he says. “We are a premium product. We are about twice as expensive as our competitors, so we’re not price sensitive.”Two years ago when the implications of Brexit were sinking in, the company leased temporary warehouse space near Manchester where 100 pallets, each holding 420 frozen ducks, could be stored, thus ensuring UK customers would continue to be supplied if ports became jammed. The warehouse option can be revived after January, if needs be.The Silverhill breed, which is half Aylesbury, half Peking, is popular in France, Germany, Scandinavia and the Far East so as regards exporting to the rest of the world, the company long ago abandoned the UK land bridge and exports now, via Dublin Port, to Cherbourg and Rotterdam.Silverhill duck has become a far-travelled delicacy. In Singapore, what is marketed as “London Fat Duck” began life as an egg in Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone. It was hatched in Slieve Bragan, Co Monaghan and reared for 42 days on farms in Monaghan and Tyrone before being processed in Emyvale – all by a workforce of about 250.Cullen believes their UK customers, who are overwhelmingly ethnic Chinese enterprises, are well used to importing from outside the EU and the prospect of WTO tariffs and regulations doesn’t worry them. “They’re all fine about it,” he says.Longer term, Cullen sees Irish-based businesses turning away from the UK.Then there’s the prospect of increasing Silverhill’s burgeoning trade with the Far East.“Indonesia,” he says excitedly, “the population’s 260 million and you think it’s a poor country but you take the top one per cent. . . you start thinking in terms of selling pallets of duck and end up thinking of container loads.”PortwestLike Silverhill, warehousing became a solution for another major exporter, Portwest, the €180 million turnover, outdoor leisure and work clothing company which is based in Westport, Co Mayo and employs 4,500 people worldwide.“Before Brexit we had one main distribution warehouse in the UK, with 250 staff, serving every country in the EU,” says Portwest managing director Harry Hughes. “After Theresa May announced that the UK were leaving the customs union, we decided to open a second distribution warehouse in Poland and were ready when the first deadline passed.”The Polish warehouse has 150 staff and serves all of Portwest’s EU customers. The UK warehouse, with 100 fewer staff, serves UK and Portwest’s non-EU customers – England’s loss was Poland’s gain.“We are now Brexit-proof from issues associated with customs and borders,” says Hughes. “No company will be exempt from the possible political or commercial fallout.”CombiLiftCombiLift is another Monaghan-based company with a global reach that has also had to react to the potential worst-case scenario in January.The company, a hugely successful maker of forklift trucks, has grown over 22 years into a €300 million turnover enterprise employing 650 people.Most of the staff work at an enormous assembly plant that is 11 acres under roof and sits on a 100 acre site at the edge of Monaghan town. Four production lines, now working two at a time in staggered shifts because of Covid-19 distancing restrictions, crank out customised forklifts trucks.Their multi-directional wheel and steering system gives them extra manoeuvrability, allowing them operate in very confined spaces. This allows CombiLift to market itself as a space saver, selling customers the notion that their existing warehouse has greater capacity, if storage aisles are reconfigured and made narrower, thereby allowing for more shelving.While the company’s two largest markets, accounting for half of output, are the UK and US, it also exports to more than 80 countries throughout Europe and the Americas, as well as to Asia, Africa and Australia.The company’s single most significant response to Brexit was to obtain from Revenue the status of Authorised Economic Operator (AEO), a process that took 10 months and culminated in the issuing of a prized AEO certificate in June 2019.What the status means in effect is that the CombiLift plant in Monaghan becomes a customs and excise frontline, rather than the frontline being at the port through which exports flow. On a day-to-day basis, this means the plant operates like a bonded warehouse so when finished products or spare parts reach a port, they pass through the green channel, without delay and unchecked.“You become a trusted partner with Revenue and as long as you do everything properly, there is no reason for them to check what you do.”That said, the plant can be subject to inspection at any time and the perimeter of the site is laser beam protected. CCTV is everywhere.CombiLift has an articulated truck or container leaving the Monaghan plant every hour of every day. The company also takes in 40 truck-loads of imported parts, the company’s manufacturing raw materials.Whatever way Brexit pans out in January, CombiLift will be able to deliver spare parts to UK customers overnight.So McVicar hasn’t given up on the UK.“Whatever happens in Brexit is not going to stop us investing there, for multiple reasons,” he says. “The UK clients are still going to need forklift trucks to move goods around. In fact, their demand for warehousing space is going to be at a higher premium because the minute a company comes out of that European block, they’ll want to want to make sure they’ve goods on their island.“UK companies are going to be stocking higher levels of components and food to deal with border scenarios and where our products come into value is, even though we make forklift trucks, we are actually in the business of selling warehouse space. We sell forklift trucks that save warehouse space and as the demand for warehousing increases, there’s more demand for our product.“So even post-Brexit, whether there’s no deal or there is a deal, we’re still going to invest in the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Nick BradshawEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has received a report from embattled commissioner Phil Hogan on his movements around the time of the controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner.Mr Hogan has been under pressure since he attended a meal at a hotel in Clifden, Co Galway last week, at which more than 80 people gathered in apparent breach of public health guidelines.Initial statements provided by his spokesman claiming Mr Hogan travelled “directly” from Co Kilkenny to the event in Co Galway have since proven to be incorrect. Mr Hogan’s team has said that he returned to Co Kildare, where local lockdown measures are in place, on his way to the golf event to collect items from his residence at the K-Club. He was stopped by gardaí in the county for using his mobile phone while driving.Dr von der Leyen then requested further details and clarification from the commissioner because “she wishes to be informed in detail about the facts, but she also wishes to understand the circumstances, she wishes simply to have the complete picture.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan discussed the controvery surrounding Mr Hogan and the golfing society dinner on Tuesday morning. ‘Detailed report’Mr Hogan’s office said the information had been provided to Dr von der Leyen at lunchtime on Tuesday after she sought “a detailed report” from the trade commissioner. “The president also encourages Commissioner Hogan to publish the timeline of his moves in Ireland during the period that he stayed there to ensure full transparency,” said European Commission spokeswoman Dana Spinant.“Once the detailed report is available the president will feel confident that she has the full picture which will enable her to complete her assessment.”Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien has called for Mr Hogan to resign, while Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar asked him to consider his position.Ms Spinant said it was “premature” to discuss any potential sanctions on the commissioner and whether Dr von der Leyen could ask him to resign.“It is absolutely premature to discuss about any sanctioning or anything like that, we are at the level where the president is looking forward to receiving a report on the matter under discussion,” she said.Dr von der Leyen has also encouraged Mr Hogan to make himself available to take questions, Ms Spinant added – which would be the first time he has appeared in public since the scandal broke.‘Zero comment’The owner of the hotel that hosted the controversial dinner, to mark the golfing society’s 50th anniversary, has said he will be making “zero comment” on the debacle. Galway businessman John Sweeney, who owns the Station House Hotel, said he was “saying absolutely nothing” in response to the political storm that has erupted over the event. “At the appropriate time the hotel will have something to say,” he told The . Mr Sweeney is a well-known Galway businessman and hotelier, and he was part of a consortium that previously acquired Dublin’s five-star Shelbourne Hotel in 2004. However, his business interests were severely hit during the economic crash. His name was listed on the seating plan for the dinner, and other guests included Fianna Fáil TD Dara Calleary, who resigned as minister for agriculture over the controversy Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe and a host of former and sitting Oireachtas members – predominantly from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The three-course dinner rounded off two days of golf at Connemara Golf Club in Ballyconneely. There had been a ider in place splitting the function room, and the ider was pulled back during a series of speeches at the event.Previous limits allowing up to 50 people to attend indoor gatherings had been reduced to just six people as part of measures announced by the Government in response to a rise in Covid-19 cases the day before the dinner.

Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Kirill KudryavtsevAFP via Getty ImagesAs Alexei Navalny, Russia’s most prominent dissident, fought for his life in a Siberian hospital after apparently being poisoned last week, three masked men occupied the chief doctor’s office.Idling under a portrait of President Vladimir Putin pensively strolling through a field of wheat, the men made small talk but refused to say who they were.Their awkward dress and shifty demeanour were all too familiar to Navalny’s family and aides, who quickly recognised them as members of the Russian security services.“It looks really funny – you can tell because they’re these tough-looking, well-built men, and they usually have these manbags,” said Ivan Zhdanov, director of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.The pervasive surveillance against Navalny, who was in Siberia making one of his YouTube corruption investigations, indicates how he remains a thorn in the Kremlin’s side after a decade of activism.Navalny, who has been jailed 13 times for organising protests against Putin, complained to the Financial Times in an interview last year that he and his family were followed around the clock by men he claimed were from Russia’s security services.“It’s been going on for quite some time, but I’d be lying if I told you it was routine and we don’t pay attention to it. Some assholes are sitting next to you all the time. But you don’t stop living your life,” he said. “Lots of people’s reaction to that would be to shut down and hide ... We enjoy our lives as we can.”Aides who accompanied Navalny on the Siberia trip and kept watch at the hospital in Omsk said they had long grown used to being followed by unmarked cars and spotting men trying to hide video cameras.“We know they constantly listen to our phone conversations, we know they put up hidden cameras, we know they take the footage from security cameras everywhere we go,” Zhdanov said. “They interrogated my relatives, everyone I had meetings with – it’s more or less total control.”Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that surveillance operations were “the prerogative of the secret services” and “cannot and should not be approved” by Putin’s administration.KompromatThe surveillance appears to date at least as far back as 2017, when Navalny began travelling across Russia in an attempt to challenge Putin for president.That year, Ren-TV, a channel whose parent company is reportedly co-owned by close Putin confidant Yuri Kovalchuk, aired a documentary accusing Navalny of receiving secret cash payments from “fugitive oligarchs”. The film used surveillance videos of Navalny on vacation with his family, intercepted phone calls, text messages, and emails, and trailed his employees in cafés.Dmitry Belousov, a former Ren-TV scriptwriter now seeking asylum in the Netherlands, told the FT he believed the secret services had passed on the footage – known in industry jargon as kompromat, for “compromising materials” – to discredit Navalny and other activists.Belousov said that Alexei Malkov, Ren-TV’s chief political producer, had previously bragged to him that a “handler” from the FSB, the successor agency to the KGB, supplied him with surveillance materials for Kremlin-commissioned state TV documentaries.Malkov uploaded the footage to Ren-TV’s servers himself, leaving Belousov to fill in the blanks in the script while reporters chased Navalny’s team on the street for comments.“He met someone, brought the material, and they were basically the ones making the film,” Belousov said. “Nobody makes those films on their own initiative. Everything is done to order for approval. The Kremlin has a story to tell and the FSB and presidential administration put the show together.”Malkov ultimately quit the channel in disgust after making the next film in the cycle, which included surveillance of several teenage opposition candidates for city councils in provincial Russia. “The FSB is the political police, it’s conducting political surveillance in Russia,” he said. “They find any kompromat, publish it on TV, and then the police start charging these activists with crimes based on nothing.”The Kremlin and the FSB did not respond to a request for comment. Ren-TV told independent investigative site Proekt, which first published Belousov’s story, that Malkov did not take instructions from the Kremlin and said its sources “could be all kinds of structures”.SurveillanceReports in the Russian press indicated the Kremlin was keeping Navalny’s seemingly routine trip to the cities of Novosibirsk and Tomsk on a very tight leash.An article in the pro-Kremlin tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets on Saturday cited “sources in the security structures” who said they had followed Navalny throughout the trip as he took selfies with followers in the town centre, rented what they termed a “conspiratorial apartment” and took a dip in the Tom river.The leak was apparently intended to show that agents could not have poisoned Navalny, claiming they had failed to detect “any superfluous or suspicious contacts”. But the article nevertheless revealed the apparent scale of the surveillance, as officers cross-checked his followers’ credit cards, a sushi delivery order, hotel bookings and followed him in unmarked cars.Proekt said a senior Kremlin official had shown its reporter Navalny’s test results before they were made public and said they showed he was “definitely not poisoned”.“The amount of resources they spend on it is remarkable,” Zhdanov said. He said that on one occasion he and Navalny met a fellow activist in a Moscow café and realised that “each of us had our own surveillance team”.“It was hilarious because there was an enormous number of people around, it was completely blatant. Seven people were within touching distance and more were sitting outside.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansMove seen as victory for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu and will infuriate PalestiniansCountry needs administration that can fight graft, says German ministerWith 200 dead, 6,000 injured and 300,000 destitute, the mood in Beirut is unbendingNames of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"british museum removes bust slave owner founder sir hans sloane","story":"The British Museum has removed a bust of its founding father from its pedestal and labelled him a “slave owner” in an attempt to confront its links to colonialism, the institution’s director has announced.Sir Hans Sloane’s likeness has instead been placed in a secure cabinet alongside artefacts that explain his work in the “exploitative context of the British Empire”.The decision was signed off by Hartwig Fischer, the museum director, and revealed in an interview in The Daily  on Monday.“We have pushed him off the pedestal,” Mr Fischer said. “We must not hide anything. Healing is knowledge.”It is part of a wider process of acknowledging the museum’s links to slavery, curators said.Other artefacts, including those taken by Captain James Cook on his voyages, will be given new labels explaining how they were acquired by the museum through “colonial conquest and military looting”. Mr Fischer said: “Dedication to truthfulness when it comes to history is absolutely crucial, with the aim to rewrite our shared, complicated and, at times, very painful history.“The case dedicated to Hans Sloane and his relationship to slavery is a very important step in this.“We have pushed him off the pedestal where nobody looked at him, and placed him in the limelight.“The British Museum has done a lot of work – accelerated and enlarged its work on its own history, the history of empire, the history of colonialism, and also of slavery. These are subjects which need to be addressed, and to be addressed properly. We need to understand our own history.”The decision to revisit Sloane’s past was made during lockdown in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which sparked debate around statues of controversial historical figures in public spaces. In June, a statue of Edward Colston was removed from its plinth by protesters in Bristol.The Rhodes Must Fall campaign in Oxford also successfully called for the removal of a statue of philanthropist Cecil Rhodes.Neal Spencer, keeper of Nile and Mediterranean objects and the curator behind the new Sloane display, said that “Black Lives Matter provides a certain level of urgency”.He added: “It’s expected of museums today. The collection is owned by the public in the widest sense.“We want to be upfront about Sloane’s collection being at the root of the British Museum. And we want to put it in a wider context, which is obviously a very difficult context.“It happened in the exploitative context of the British Empire. I wouldn’t describe it as an imperialist organisation, but it is a museum that was founded within the context of Empire.“Eventually we’re going to be redisplaying the whole British Museum. We want to tell more of these stories.“We want to talk more about the context of how the museum was founded.”Sloane’s collection of 71,000 artefacts became the starting point of the British Museum after being bequeathed to the state in his will.The Irish-born collector, known for London street names such as Sloane Square, and being the purported inventor of drinking chocolate, also had investments in the slave-trading Royal African and South Sea Companies.These facts are now noted on labels beside his terracotta bust, which is surrounded by tokens of the slave trade and its legacy.A panel beside Sloane’s bust explains that this collection was “enabled by the wealth and networks that grew out of European imperialism”.New labels also state that this bequeathed hoard contained “anatomical specimens relating to skin colour and theories of racial difference”.While the origins of the foundational collection are being examined, a new “trail” for visitors will allow them to move through the museum on a themed tour of 16 objects unjustly taken from far-flung places in the days of Empire.This trail will not include the Parthenon Marbles – also known as the Elgin Marbles – which have long been the subject of demands for repatriation to Greece after being taken from the Acropolis in the early 19th century.Mr Fischer is determined that in the coming years the long-term commitment of the museum to being open about its imperial heritage will lead to an overhaul in the information available to members of the public visiting in future.He said: “This is not just about empire and colonialism, and European expansion across the world in the last 500 years.“It is also setting this in the wider context of human history.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks national interest joe biden wins presidential race","story":"As the United States embarks on what might be its most acrimonious election in living memory, what outcome would be in the interests of the UK? A case can be made that the first term of President Trump has been not too bad from the British point of view. He is warm towards Britain, likes our Prime Minister and is in favour of a free trade deal. His administration has backed us up at some crucial moments, such as over the Salisbury poisonings, or China’s breach of its agreements with us over Hong Kong. He never looks happier abroad, or behaves with more decorum, than when visiting the Queen.These are actions we can appreciate, as are the tireless efforts of American diplomats to keep cooperation with allies on the road. Trump’s inability to keep a team together – with repeated changes of defence secretary, national security adviser and senior intelligence officials – has been damaging, but at lower levels the US system works closely with us every day, sharing valuable intelligence, keeping our militaries aligned and helping with law enforcement.Furthermore, it can be argued, many of Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements are part of a longer-term trend in US thinking. His attitude to China is symptomatic of Washington waking up to the rise of a new strategic adversary. The lectures to allies about paying their own way are an extension of appeals made by Obama, albeit more threatening. And his desire to bring troops home from Syria and Afghanistan is also part of a common American exhaustion after Iraq, even if more erratic and temperamental.So far, so much relief. Trump has not wrecked Nato or blown up the world. Yet we British have to recognise that something is fundamentally wrong. Something vital to us, as a medium-sized, transatlantic, democratic nation, is missing. We need the US to be the active leader of a network of alliances, of which we are a part, and to combine its great financial and physical strength with moral authority and respected global leadership. In the next four years, the need for that leadership will be as vital as it ever has been since the end of the Cold War. No other country can come close to providing it. And we have seen enough now to know that Donald Trump is not going to give it.The Covid-19 crisis has been, as in so many ways, a revelatory moment. Leave aside the chaotic domestic response in America – we have not been in a position to preach, and Europe’s problems are far from over. But the most striking aspect of the crisis has been the absence of any attempt at global leadership. The one person who could have moved other nations and his own to take it seriously, to coordinate policies, to consult on closing borders, share vaccine research, and act to prevent future pandemics, was the US president. The leader who could have summoned the G20, and even now could be ensuring sufficient support for developing countries to prevent a health and economic meltdown with far-reaching consequences, is in the White House.Next year, the UK will host the Cop26, the world conference on climate change. It will be the most crucial such meeting since Paris in 2015, and a decisive moment in seeking agreement from all countries to take necessary action. The Trump administration is uninterested in such issues and even hostile to addressing them. Within the US, it is pushing ahead with the obscenity of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Internationally, it is unwilling to give the lead that would bring a global agreement within reach.Other issues of vast and lasting importance are coming to a head. Rivalry with China may well be unavoidable, but we need America to be at the centre of strong alliances as it faces up to that, not striking out on its own. Trump’s early decision to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership weakened his own country’s position on international trade, and the value to this country of ultimately joining the pact. More widely on China, Western countries are on the strongest ground when opposing totalitarian behaviour but still seeking a framework of coordination with Beijing on pressing global issues – arms control, climate change, and economic stability. Trump, however, often seems to have this the wrong way round: raising few objections to dictatorship while failing to find a constructive framework.One excruciating extract of the book by the most recently departed national security adviser, John Bolton, recounted how “Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do.” This is part of a pattern: he greeted Xi Jinping becoming president indefinitely with “I think it’s great”, said Kim Jong-Un had “a great and beautiful vision” for his country and has repeatedly raised inviting Putin to the G7, despite the deep discomfort of the leaders of other free nations.At a time when democracies, though resilient, are under the great strains of internal discontent and growing external interference, this disdain for the values of freedom and democracy is deeply damaging to the West. It is amplified by Trump’s unsubstantiated charges of fraudulent voting in his own country, intended to undermine confidence in any unwelcome result. \u2028It is in the vital interests of the UK that America, our indispensable ally, is ironclad and steadfast in its attachment to democracy at home and abroad: the capital and the arsenal of freedom.Last week, 73 former US national security officials who worked under the Reagan and Bush presidencies called on Republicans to forsake their party and vote for Joe Biden. Many British Conservatives, even those of us with decades-long friendships among Republicans, will feel the same. Biden will face his own problems, particularly of how to restrain the Left of his own party. But if he wins, which is by no means certain, he is committed to uphold human rights and democracy, persuade other countries to join the US in more ambitious environmental goals, and “restore a commitment to science and truth in government”. Such an approach would be good for the world and for America. And that means it would be good for Britain.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"petition rule britannia sung last night proms reaches 10000","story":"Some 10,000 people have signed a petition calling for the BBC to fully reinstate Rule, Britannia! into their ‘Proms’ programme, as a cabinet minister said he would “like to see the lyrics sung”.Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary said the Last Night of the Proms brings “a huge amount of pleasure to millions of people” and that if singing is not possible, the BBC should put up subtitles.On Monday night the BBC defied the Government by announcing that Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory will not be sung at this year’s Last Night of the Proms.Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, had warned the BBC not to “erase history” by dropping the songs amid a row over colonialism, while Boris Johnson had told the corporation it was a mistake to target the “symbols” rather than the “substance” of such issues.But the BBC ignored them, effectively censoring the traditional anthems by choosing to play orchestral versions only, with no soloist singing the lyrics. With no audience because of coronavirus restrictions, there will be no-one to sing along to them either.One government source described the decision as “incredible” and signalled that ministers were taken aback by the decision because they had believed the BBC would back down and stick with tradition.On Tuesday morning, Mr Sharma said: “Personally, I would like to see the lyrics sung, and of course it’s always possible to put the lyrics up as subtitles on the screen so people who want to can join in.”He echoed the Prime Minister’s sentiments that “we need to tackle the source of the problem” around racism and colonialism.By Tuesday morning a petition to have the songs played as before, with singing, reached 10,000 signatures.“The singing of two rousing patriotic anthems, Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory, has been part of the programme of The Last Night of the Proms for many years. But their performance is now threatened with cancellation by the forces of political correctness,” says the petition.“The annual singing of these songs on The Last Night of the Proms, which is broadcast on BBC Television, has become a much-cherished ritual,” it adds. “They are sung with pride and sentiment, but also with a degree of joshing humour and wry self-mockery that is characteristically British.”Christopher Silvester, who started the petition told the  this morning: The BBC\u0027s pathetic justification for not having soloists and chorus but only playing orchestral versions of these patriotic songs is, of course, the coronavirus pandemic. And yet they managed to use soloists in their VE Day and VJ Day televised concerts. Indeed, they used a gospel choir in the VJ Day concert. Admittedly those concerts were filmed outdoors, but nonetheless the Albert Hall is perfectly suited to the social distancing of singers and with all the BBC\u0027s expertise in the use of microphones it should be possible to accommodate a reduced chorus. The failure to do this betrays the BBC\u0027s true colours and reveals their political agenda.Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Litchfield told BBC Radio 4 this morning: “I think it\u0027s all very sad. “There are some lovely words to Rule, Britannia! You start to talk about ‘Rule, Britannia! and Britain shouldn\u0027t be slaves’, but you\u0027ve got ‘other nations not so blessed as thee must in the turn to tyrants fall. While thou shalt flourish great and free’. I mean, isn\u0027t that lovely?” He added that he appreciated what Oliver Dowden said on the issue.“I rather like the quote by the way from all the doubt the culture secretary who said, confident forward looking nations don\u0027t erase their history, they add to it. And you know, Britain\u0027s history is not all bad. We abolished slavery in 1807, more than 50 years before the United States got round to that and that\u0027s something of which we can be proud of.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"picture special farewell boeing 747","story":"The 747 was imagined in the 1960s to meet a growing demand for air travel, with Pan Am asking Boeing to design a plane twice the size of the 707, the first jetliner.It was the first twin aisle airliner and able to sit up to 10 across in economy class.

It was this bubble top that made the aircraft instantly recognisable. By launch in 1970, nearly 30 of the world’s airlines had secured orders. The First Lady of the United States Pat Nixon christened the first aircraft before its inaugural flight, on Pan Am’s New York-London route, on which it would become such a success.Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Though its appeal to carriers was a low operating cost per seat, many airlines, especially flag carriers, purchased the 747 due to its prestige. Through the 1980s, Boeing was taking scores of orders for the aircraft every year, and delivering as many as 70 to its customers.The 747 brought air travel to the masses but it also ushered in a new Golden Age of Flying, with additional space allowing for unprecedented comfort and luxury.Though more and more people were able to fly, it was still considered a special occasion, prompting travellers and families to dress up for flights. Aircraft serving the holiday markets of the Caribbean were said to have carnival atmospheres on board.As planned by Boeing, the 747 was long popular with cargo operators thanks to its unobstructed fuselage and vast capacity. It could take off with a payload of up to 970,000lbs.Boeing continued to update the aircraft, stretching and modernising it to make it more fuel efficient. There are five main variants, with different models within each category, including the latest, the 747-8. Nasa still has a 747 in service it used to transport spacecraft, while Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic does the same, launching its aircraft at altitude. The evolution of smaller, more fuel efficient aircraft that are easier to fill, such as Boeing’s own 787 Dreamliner, makes the 747 less attractive to airlines. Today, more cargo operators than passenger airlines fly the aircraft, while orders have all but dried up.

His brother, who is also Ronaldinho\u0027s business manager, must pay $110,000.The judge stressed that he was not issuing a definitive dismissal of the case but rather that Ronaldinho was benefitting from a conditional suspension of the procedure.His brother, on the other hand, was given a two-year suspended sentence.Prosecutors said they did not believe Ronaldinho took part in the plan to manufacture the fake Paraguayan passports but believed de Assis Moreira was aware that the passports were false.They flagrantly used a public document containing false content, said Marcelo Pecci, one of the public prosecutors, who said it was a very serious offense.De Assis Moreira must appear before a judge in Brazil every four months for two years and will have a criminal record.Ronaldinho\u0027s situation is not the same as Roberto\u0027s. He has no obligation to appear before any Brazilian judicial authority. He must only report a change of address, said Amarilla, who accepted a recommendation by four prosecutors to avoid the need for an oral trial.Before Monday\u0027s trial the public prosecutor said that Ronaldinho displayed no personal characteristics or criminal behavior that ... would put society at risk.The brothers arrived in Paraguay on March 4 with Ronaldinho, the 2005 Ballon d\u0027Or winner, due to take part in an event in support of disadvantaged children.However, two days later, the pair were taken into police custody when investigators raided their hotel following the discovery they had fake documents.Before the judge announced his decision, the defense issued a statement insisting on the innocence of both brothers.They presented Paraguayan documents to migration authorities believing they were authentic, said the statement. The people they trusted deceived them vilely.After being held in a police station in Asuncion, where Ronaldinho celebrated his 40th birthday on March 21, the two men had been under house arrest for more than four months in a luxury hotel in the capital, on bail of $1.6 million.The investigation has since expanded into a case of possible money laundering and criminal association.Some 18 people have already been arrested in connection with the case, most of them immigration officials or police officers.The investigation found no indication that either participated in money laundering or criminal association, said the defense statement.Ronaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was crucial in Brazil\u0027s 2002 World Cup win.He played for European giants such as Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain during a hugely successful 10-year stint in Europe.He won the Champions League and two La Liga titles with Barcelona and Serie A with Milan.After returning home to Brazil he won the Copa Libertadores - South America\u0027s equivalent of the Champions League - with Atletico Mineiro.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rule britannia freedom not slavery","story":"The BBC is in charge of the Proms, and is proud of their wide appeal. It says on its own website: “Last Night of the Proms is one of the most popular nights for the whole of the BBC Proms.” Does it ask itself why? It may have something to do with the fact that Rule, Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are always sung that evening, with the audience enthusiastically joining in.For years now, pressure groups have complained about these songs. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, protests have grown louder. This year’s all-encompassing excuse of Covid-19 is also being deployed. Allegedly, the large quantity of players required to make the right noise might send the virus flying round the Albert Hall.Critics of Rule, Britannia fasten on a few words. One verse rejects “haughty tyrants”. According to Chi-Chi Nwanoku, a principal double bass player, this is dreadful because the British are so describing those whose land they invade. In fact, the meaning is the exact opposite: it warns against haughty tyrants – unparliamentary European powers of the mid-18th century, such as France and Spain – who might wish to invade us.As for the famous line, “Britons never will be slaves”, this is taken by Wasfi Kani, of Grange Park Opera, to suggest that “someone else can be slaves.The words contain no evidence for that interpretation. They first appeared in Thomas Arne’s 1740 masque, Alfred, about the English King (of burnt cakes legend) who defeated the invading Vikings, thus helping forge the nation. The beings in Rule, Britannia who sing about Britons never being slaves are the “ angels” who oversaw the birth of Britain “from out the azure main”. Their message is that we are born free. So last night the BBC announced that the music stays but the wicked words will go. British people value their freedom. A good many of them like celebrating it with the traditional songs of liberty. If the BBC has difficulty with that, what does it understand about the people from whom it collects the licence fee?The BBC is, however, devoting a radio programme tonight to “code-switching”. The term comes from linguistics. It means the way in which people can move between types of language or different languages in the course of the same conversation. “Franglais” would be a jokey example.Now, however, in our hypersensitive world, it has become another thing we must blame on white supremacy. It is said that black people who work with white people must code-switch to survive. They have to adopt “white” locutions and suppress their accustomed ways of talking.There can be no doubt that such code-switching takes place. But what else would one expect? It applies to any work environment in which people come from different backgrounds. In order to understand one another clearly in the workplace, a particular way of speech will tend to prevail.Thus, until about 40 years ago, the BBC always favoured the “public-school” accent among its presenters. People with regional or working-class accents had to code-switch in order to read the news. Nowadays, it is the other way round. People with public-school backgrounds have to code-switch to “mockney” in order to get on in the BBC.When I was a boy, I attended the village school, but was brought up at home with “received pronunciation”. One day, when schoolfriends came home to tea, my parents taped our conversation. The recording showed me unconsciously code-switching between fellow-pupils and my parents.Surely such adjustments are amusing, and sometimes necessary, rather than yet another thing to get furious about.I am so old that I can remember when Joe Biden first tried to become president of the United States. In the autumn of 1987, Mr Biden got into trouble for pinching speech phrases from Neil Kinnock, then the British Labour leader. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” Mr Kinnock had asked in Wales, in May.In Iowa, in August 1987, Mr Biden said, “I started thinking as I was coming over here, why is it that Joe Biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university?” He was “the first Biden in a thousand generations to get a college and a graduate degree”. Both men argued that their forebears had suffered not from stupidity, but lack of opportunity. Mr Biden did not acknowledge the phrase as Mr Kinnock’s. He did not get the nomination.Part of the comedy was the idea of a thousand generations of Kinnocks, or Bidens. For that, one would have to go back to before the invention of the wheel. It is only about 20 generations to the invention of the university.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tanks could scrapped radical overhaul armed forces","story":"Britain\u0027s tanks could be axed under radical proposals by military chiefs to modernise the armed forces. Instead, other military assets could be prioritised including cyber and space technology. The cost of upgrading the fleet of 227 Challenger 2 tanks and the 388 Warrior armoured fighting vehicles has soared encouraging the Government to consider the controversial plans. A government source told The Times: We know that a number of bold decisions need to be taken in order to properly protect British security and rebalance defence interests to meet the new threats we face.The relevance of the Challenger and Warrior tanks to modern warfare has been questioned in recent years and the MoD has shifted some investment to cyberwarfare and other cutting-edge technology.The MoD is also expecting a cut to its budget due to the impact of coronavirus on the public finances.The Times reported that the UK is already in discussions with Nato partners about plans to give up heavy armour and overhaul Britain\u0027s military contribution to the alliance.A source told the newspaper: “We simply will not be viewed as a credible leading Nato nation if we cannot field close-combat capabilities.

Augmented reality is when digital experiences are placed over real world objects, similar to Pokemon Go, whereas virtual reality is entirely in a digital space. Apple analyst Ming-chi Kuo, who regularly accurately revealed information about forthcoming products from the company, has suggested the company will be announcing augmented reality glasses.In an interview with The Independent, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that he does not believe “anything will be untouched” by augmented reality, and that shopping will be changed “entirely”.

While Nintendo has released other versions since – including upgrading its battery life as well as releasing a Lite version that did away with the option to plug into a television – the console has gone largely unchanged since that first release.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe addition of 4K graphics and other upgraded features would come as rival console makers release new products with vastly upgraded hardware. Both the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 are due at the end of this year, and both are leaning heavily on improved speed and performance.Nintendo has not traditionally chased the same high-end market as its rivals. But the Bloomberg report noted that an upgrade would allow it to fight for gamers\u0027 attention amid those other releases.Nintendo making more Switches as console hit by stock shortagesThe report gave little information on what those extra specifications could include, reporting only that Nintendo has looked into more computing power and 4K graphics. It did not explicitly indicate whether those improved graphics would be on the portable version of the console or only appear when it is plugged into a television.Updating the console would also allow the Switch to become the company\u0027s most long-lasting console, the report noted. Nintendo has released updated versions of other consoles in the past, upgrading them halfway through their life to keep them competitive, such as the Nintendo DS.New versions of the Nintendo Switch have been rumoured since last year, when reports suggested that the company was planning both a premium version and a slimmed-down one. The latter arrived in the form of the Nintendo Switch Lite, and alterations were made to the normal version of the Switch that increased its battery life, but a more expensive or significantly upgraded version of the Switch is yet to appear.Nintendo said at the beginning of this year that it was not planning to release new Switch models in 2020. Instead, it would focus on promoting the existing ones – both the normal Switch and the Lite version.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the song will be part of the event, albeit without lyrics due to the lack of audience amid the coronavirus pandemic. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAmid a backlash over the BBC’s decision to do a non-singing rendition of the anthem, what exactly are the lyrics, and where did the song come from?Written in 1740, “Rule, Britannia!” originates from James Thomson’s poem, “Rule, Britannia” and was set to music by Thomas Arne.At the time, the Royal Navy did not hold dominance over the oceans – which it achieved by the 19th century – and so the lyrics only took on a more patriotic significance by the late 1800s.Here are the lyrics: Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!Britons never, never, never will be slaves.When Britain first, at heaven\u0027s command,Arose from out the azure main,This was the charter of the land,And  Angels sang this strain:The nations not so blest as theeMust, in their turn, to tyrants fall,While thou shalt flourish great and free:The dread and envy of them all.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful from each foreign stroke,As the loud blast that tears the skiesServes but to root thy native oak.All their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse thy generous flame,But work their woe and thy renown.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineAll thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles, thine.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coasts repair.Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves!Britons never, never, never will be slaves.In a statement confirming the songs would be performed, the BBC’s condemned “unjustified personal attacks” against this year’s conductor for the Proms.Michael Jackson criticised The Beatles in unearthed notes on racismThe Killers: ‘It’s a pretty gloomy time for America’Bruce Hornsby: ‘My entire class cheered when Kennedy was assassinated’Dalia Stasevska, who was reportedly was among those eager to update the programme, has received abuse on social media following Sunday’s reports.The BBC said: “We very much regret the unjustified personal attacks on Dalia Stasevska, BBC Symphony Orchestra principal guest conductor, made on social media and elsewhere.“As ever, decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved.”The Last Night of the Proms takes place on 12 September.Last Night of the Proms\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said that evidence continues to emerge, the government in Westminster should review its guidance on the matter. Geoff Barton, the union\u0027s general secretary, said a recent decision in Scotland to require masks should also prompt a re-think.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It would be prudent in the light of the decision in Scotland over face coverings in schools, and the recent guidance by the World Health Organisation, for the government in Westminster to review its existing guidance that face coverings are not required in schools in England, and provide clear direction one way or another, he said.Face masks in schools should be an option, says union22 teachers and pupils test positive for Covid-19 at reopened schoolCoronavirus: Will children have to wear face masks at school?“We have two concerns. First, parents, pupils, and staff, will be anxious about the situation and need reassurance from the government about the public health basis for its policy over face coverings in England, rather than it being left entirely to schools to explain the government’s rationale. And, second, if there is going to be any U-turn by the government that it does this sooner rather than later because the start of the new term is imminent.”On Monday, a Number 10 spokesman said there were no plans to review the guidance on face coverings in schools, telling reporters: We are conscious of the fact that it would obstruct communication between teachers and pupils.Ministers dug in further on Tuesday morning, with business minister Alok Sharma telling Sky News: PHE do not recommend the wearing of face masks in schools ... there is no current plan to review that particular guidance.Teachers\u0027 unions have been arguing that face masks should be recommended in schools since at least July. The National Education Union this week accused ministers of being “negligent in the extreme” over the issue. Unison, Britain\u0027s largest trade union which represents a number of non-teaching staff in schools, also today reiterated its call for adults working in schools to be allowed to wear masks.In Scottish secretary schools, face coverings are to be used in corridors and shared areas.

Ever see 6 water spouts at once?” Mr Leday wrote on Facebook. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWater sprouts are tornadoes that form over water, or move from land to water,  according to the National Ocean Service.The watery vortexes have the same characteristics as a regular tornado, usually occur during storms and can be just as dangerous as regular tornadoes. Double hurricane threat as two tropical storms advance towards USMr Leday caught sight of the phenomenon as two tropical storms brewed off the coast of the US and hailstones in Louisiana.After a day as a hurricane, Storm Marco brought a surge of high water to the Louisiana coast on Monday, setting the stage for Tropical Storm Laura to enter the Gulf of Mexico and move towards the same stretch of US coast later in the week, most likely as a hurricane.People along the Gulf Coast braced for an onslaught from the twin storms, with many evacuees recalling the damage caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when catastrophic flooding breached the levees in New Orleans and as many as 1,800 people died.“What we know is there’s going to be storm surge from Marco, we know that that water is not going to recede hardly at all before Laura hits, and so we’ve not seen this before and that’s why people need to be paying particular attention,” Governor John Bel Edwards warned at a Sunday briefing.Marco had grown into a hurricane early Sunday, and while its top winds dropped to 50 mph on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center cautioned that Marco could still cause life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds along the Gulf Coast. Marco was centred about 85 miles (135 kilometres) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River Monday morning, moving northwest at 10 mph (17 kph).

Haiti’s prime minister said at least eight other people died and two were missing. In the Dominican Republic, relatives told reporters a collapsed wall killed a mother and her young son.Hundreds of thousands were without power in the Dominican Republic amid heavy flooding in both countries.Despite Marco’s weakening, a storm surge warning remained in place from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. A tropical storm warning included Lake Pontchartrain in Louisiana and metropolitan New Orleans.A storm surge of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters) was forecast for parts of coastal Louisiana and Mississippi.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All attendees agreed to comply with the requirements prior to attending and were informed that these requirements would be enforced.”According to the Charlotte Observer, RNC officials had previously assured Ms Harris’s office that they would enforce North Carolina’s statewide mandate on face masks, which stipulates that they must be worn in public places.Ex-Fox News host attacks California in shouted speech at RNCOn the day that Mr Trump officially accepted the Republican Party nomination for president, around 300 party delegates gathered at the convention centre. Photos from inside the RNC show some delegates appearing to flout the rules by not wearing face masks – and appearing to continue doing so even after Ms Harris had raised the issue with GOP staff running the convention, the Charlotte Observer report states.Images also showed some attendees huddling together in small groups and shaking hands during intervals in the day’s proceedings. The Independent has contacted the RNC for comment.The first day of the 2020 Republican convention began early in the day as Mr Trump and his vice president Mike Pence accepted their nominations to re-run for office.Trump makes bid for empathy on opening night of RNCThe president paid a surprise visit to the city, where he warned delegates that “the only way they can take this election away from us is if this is a rigged election,” raising anew his unsupported concerns about Americans’ expected reliance on mail voting during the pandemic. Experts say mail voting has proven remarkably secure.The fact the Republicans gathered at all stood in contrast to the Democrats, who held an all-virtual convention last week. The Democratic programming included a well-received roll call video montage featuring erse officials from across the nation.On day two of the convention, Republicans will hear from Eric, Tiffany and Melania Trump, as well as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Senator Rand Paul. Nicholas Sandmann, who featured in a viral video last year in front of the Lincoln Memorial in the nation’s capital, is also scheduled to speak.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said this morning the risk to childrens long term wellbeing is far greater than the risk of coronavirus.The PM has begged parents to save their kids le chances by sending them back to school.Online learning provider Oxford Home Schooling reported a massive  per cent rise in enrolments for  to  year olds and a  per cent increase in  to  year olds.London-based Minerva Tutors also said enquires in the last two months have rocketed by  per cent.Greg Smith, head of operations at Oxford Home Schooling, said: We have never had this many calls.What we are seeing is a rise in enquiries for GCSE courses and people will be applying in the next couple of weeks... We are anticipating a massive increase in applications.Mainly people are saying they dont want to send their children back to schools. Ive spoken to lot of parents who are shielding and they dont want to send their children back because it opens a whole set of risks.Many of the parents are living in multi-generational households and they are worried about the child bringing back the virus and potentially their grandparents contracting coronavirus. Thats the kind of fear they have.I think the long term effects of Covid- are going to be massive.Parents are allowed to educate their child at home and a school can only refusethey plan to send their kids into classrooms part of the time.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Is there no end to their wokeness  How about the enjoyment of the millions of Brits who pay the licence fee  You can’t choose history on your terms. It doesn’t belong to you.It came as a BBC source described the handling of the Proms line-up as “white guys in a panic,” trying to appease the Black Lives Matter movement.Meanwhile Boris Johnson slammed the “woke” plans to axe the patriotic sing-along climax from next month’s bash.Debating the issue on Good Morning Britain, freedom of speech campaigner Inaya Folarin Iman said criticism of the two songs was absurd, adding that they bring a lot of people joy and happiness.But Kehinde Andrews, a black studies professor at Birmingham City University, said the line Britons never, never, never shall be slaves from Rule Britannia is racist propaganda dating back to the British Empire.Organisers said they were concerned about the lyrics along with their links.TV choirmaster Gareth Malone, told The Times that he supported removing Rule Britannia lyrics in solidarity with black and Irish members of his choirs who had refused to sing it in previous years. He said: “If people want to sing about the subjugation and enslavement of other nations, I don’t think that should be given a  in .”His view was shared by Chi-Chi Nwanoku, founder of the Chineke! Foundation, which supports ethnic minority musicians. She told : “The lyrics are just so offensive.The annual Royal Albert Hall concert, beamed around the world, traditionally ends with the flag-waving anthems.At the weekend, it was reported that the conductor for this years Last Night, Dalia Stasevska of Finland, was keen to reduce the patriotic elements of the event.It led to a backlash yesterday, with the Prime Minister and Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, getting involved.Mr Dowden told the BBC that “confident, forward-looking nations don’t erase their history”.And Boris Johnson said that while he understands the emotions involved, “we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols”.Former Cabinet Minister Andrea Leadsom tweeted: “Seriously  Has the Beeb totally lost touch ”Tory MP David Morris said: “We cannot erase our history. We have got to be proud to be British. It does not matter what colour, creed or religion you are.”Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage told The Sun: “The BBC should stop apologising for our history and our heritage. People will be disgusted by this level of political correctness. The only thing that needs cancelling is the BBC itself.” And North West Durham MP Richard Holden wrote: “Another stupid move from the BBC. Just let the people sing! At every turn the BBC just dig the hole they’re in a bit deeper. They need to stop with this attempt to appease the woke morons.”In a bid to defuse the row, BBC bosses announced last night that the Last Night on September  would still feature familiar, patriotic elements.It said: With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time [...].It added that the programme will include new orchestral versions of Pomp and Circumstance March No  Land of Hope and Gloryand Rule Britannia.There will be no audience at the Proms due to Covid restrictions. Mother of the FreeHow shall we extol theeWho are born of thee Wider still, and widerShall thy bounds be setGod, who made thee mightyMake thee mightier yet!Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crownedGod make thee mightier yet!On Sovran brows, beloved, renownedOnce more thy crown is setThine equal laws, by Freedom gainedHave ruled thee well and longBy Freedom gained, by Truth maintainedThine Empire shall be strongThy fame is ancient as the daysAs Ocean large and wide: A pride that dares, and heeds not praiseA stern and silent prideNot that  joy that dreams contentWith what our sires have wonThe blood a hero sire hath spentStill nerves a hero sonBritons never, never, never shall be slaves.When Britain first, at heavens command,Arose from out the azure main,This was the charter of the land,AndAngels sang this strain:The nations not so blest as theeMust, in their turn, to tyrants fall,While thou shalt flourish great and free:The dread and envy of them all.Still more majestic shalt thou rise,More dreadful from each foreign stroke,As the loud blast that tears the skiesServes but to root thy native oak.Thee haughty tyrants neer shall tameAll their attempts to bend thee downWill but arouse thy generous flame,But work their woe and thy renown.To thee belongs the rural reignThy cities shall with commerce shineAll thine shall be the subject main,And every shore it circles, thine.The Muses, still with freedom found,Shall to thy happy coasts repair.Blest isle! with matchless beauty crowned,And manly hearts to guard the fair.Rule, Britannia!

But former Brexit Secretary David Davis has warned it is a critical endgame and the UK will soon have to be preparing for talks to collapse.He said Brussels will try to take things to the wire, adding: “The last three weeks will matter more than the first three years.” One Eurocrat admitted “outsiders don’t realise how pessimistic we’ve become” about getting a trade deal.The UK is holding firm on a refusal to accept EU red tape or cave in on fishing rights. Mr Barnier fears talks are headed for a bitter breakdown.He believes Downing Street is laying the ground for a vicious “blame game” over who is responsible for the stalemate.In a gloomy briefing to diplomats, the grumpy Frenchman claimed that last week’s tetchy round of talks have made things worse.The UK’s negotiator David Frost had put forward a draft text last week in the hope of speeding up the discussions. But Mr Barnier dismissed it as “unrealistic” and urged EU states to stay “cold blooded”.He insisted that the UK’s “clear strategy” will be to “trade off” fishing access for freedom from EU rules at the last minute.An EU source said: “We expect the mood to switch rapidly to contingency planning in expectation the UK will throw itself into the blame game rather than the endgame.”A British official hit back, saying: “The UK has consistently pushed for detailed textual discussions on the core elements of a trade agreement.“If the EU continues to stall progress because of its unrealistic asks on fish and subsidies, we will quickly run out of time.”Well now Ive seen everything. The gullible British Remainer Press report breathlessly that Michel Barnier is telling usthat the Brexit negotiations are “running out of time.” This of course is the man who squandered a year on the minutiae of the Withdrawal Agreement whilst refusing to discuss the hugely important future trade arrangement, all the while claiming that we were “running out of time.” Rather shamefully the British government put up with this nonsense, which led in turn to my resignation – but that is a story for another day.Now Barnier is desperate to resolve his so-called redline issues before we get to the critical endgame.I have always said that the last three weeks will matter more than the first three years. But there will come a time very shortly when we will have to sht the thrust of our preparations towards No Deal.The reason for this is that the European Union always runs out the clock. When it is bullying some smaller state this works to its advantage. In the Brexit negotiation what will happen in the last few weeks is that the nation states of Europe will have to come to terms with the size of the risks that Barnier is taking.If we end up with a no deal scenario – and it is possible – the Europeans stand to lose a large and very profitable marketplace, namely the United Kingdom. They stand to lose access to the most efficient financial market in the world, the City, which provides brilliantly low cost and low risk finance to all of their industries. They think that is punishing us, but they will really punish themselveswe are smart about it. They stand to lose any access to British fisheries, rather than the sensible and civilised arrangements that would apply once they accept agreed British control of our waters.They stand to lose the funding that was agreed under the Withdrawal Agreement, which was agreed on the presumption that we would get a trade deal, a political promise that the EU is failing to keep.Without a reasonable trade deal there is nothing to stop the United Kingdom repudiating the whole agreement, and simply maintaining the parts that we as a civilised nation would of course apply – including for example the protection of the rights of European Citizens.But pay money  Why  Recognise European product classications in the UK, the so-called Geographical Indications, that protect inidual European products like ham,or cheese, orbeer or wine  Why should we not allow cheaper and better products from the rest of the world to use the names in our Supermarkets This would not be the best outcome, but we would manage perfectly well.If the EU put tarfs on our goods, we willthe favour, and make money on it. Our currency would no doubt adjust to keep us competitive.And without the limitations of EU law, we could support the industries that the EU is trying to punish.Which of course is one of the reasons that the EU is trying to tie our hands on state subsidies to industry. Britain has always been much less likely to use these than European nations, but the Europeans know that they are a potential defensive weaponthey try to punish our industries.David Frost, our Brexit negotiator, is doing a good job. He has been clear on our “red lines”. Unlike the EU “red lines”, these are not just ideas made up by the Government, they are the direct outcome of the referendum. As such they represent the peoples decision, and are not subject to concession.We are not going to allow Brussels to decide our laws – which is what Barnier means by a level playing field. So it is time that the Europeans woke up to the realities.It is clear that there are only two options now for leaving at the end of the transition period, a no deal exit or a zero-tarf deal. All sensible business owners will be preparing for both. Deferral and delay is the only thing that affects certainty and the delay on March th last year was the only time when the economy was rattled – businesses will be ready for Brexit come what may when the transition period finishes at the end of the year.Certainty is what both business and the country as a whole require, not just to get Brexit done but also to help ensure that the economy bounces back from the negative economic effects of the lockdown.We already know that there has been no “Great British Exodus” nor immediate recession despite what certain pundits and commentators predicted.As long as we leave on time and do not drag this out any further, there is no reason why this should change. Indeed,we deliver the certainty of the end of the transition period, there is every reason that business and the economy will bounce back.It is incredible after all this time to see Brussels still bent on ensuring that Britain somehow loses out, so fixated are they on deterring others from ­abandoning their club.They are still making patently unreasonable power grabs even their europhile fans struggle to defend. They still want newly-independent Britain to surrender full control of our fishing waters. To agree economic restrictions to prevent us undercutting them and keep us under their thumb.They simply must change the recordthey’re genuinely worried about the potential hardship of us trading on WTO terms — and them copping the blame. No objective person will fault Britain for sticking to its guns on principles so fundamental.Michel Barnier won’t get his way. He and those pulling his strings seem strangely unable to digest that the Theresa May regime is gone, that voters threw out the Remainer Parliament and installed committed Brexiteers instead.We do agree with Barnier that negotiations seem dead in the water and a “no deal” looks nailed on.

C. Benson, and was then put to music by Edward Elgar at the beginning of the th century, in .It was King Edward VII himself who suggested the melody for the lyrics.Solo    Dear Land of Hope, thy hope is crowned,       God make thee mightier yet!    On Sovran brows, beloved, renowned,       Once more thy crown is set.   Thine equal laws, by Freedom gained,       Have ruled thee well and long   By Freedom gained, by Truth maintained,       Thine Empire shall be strong.Chorus            Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free,            How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee             Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set            God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet,            God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet.Solo    Thy fame is ancient as the days,       As Ocean large and wide:    A pride that dares, and heeds not praise,       A stern and silent pride    Not that  joy that dreams content       With what our sires have won    The blood a hero sire hath spent       Still nerves a hero son.The song has recently caused controversy, because of its direct references to the glory of the British Empire.The patriotic classic has caused a stir after the BBC considered dropping it from the Last Night Of The Proms.Land of Hope and Glory has been called out for having links to colonialism in its lyrics - and in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests, has been deemed controversial.Critics have seen the lyrics, By freedom gained, by truth maintained, thine Empire shall be strongas ironic - since it was by enslaving and conquering other lands, taking their freedom, that the Empire was strong.Prof Kehinde Andrews, from the School of Social Sciences at Birmingham City University, insisted both Rule Britannia and Land Of Hope And Glory should no longer be played due to their racist propaganda connotations.The academic said on Good Morning Britain: Ban is the wrong word, its not censorship.Its saying some songs, particularly those two, are racist propaganda which celebrates the British Empire which killed tens of millions people, many of which like myself are descendants of those victims of colonialism.Its totally inappropriate, its not about banning and censorship, its about saying what songs do we want to represent us.If, and its a big , we do want an anti-racist Britain then songs like these should not be celebrated in the proms.Land of Hope and Glory was written in .At the time, the British had just won the Boer War, and the Empire was about to reach its peak - having sway over  per cent of the world population.The patriotic song is full of references to the glory of the British Empire, colonialism, and the idea that Britons were blessed by God who made them mightier.The lyrics in the chorus, Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set alludes to making the British Empire bigger and bigger - a concept that critics say shouldnt be gloried in a song.The reference to the extension of the British Empires boundaries may reflect the Boer War - which Brits won at the time the song was written.Classical music critic Richard Morrison said in a column for BBC Music Magazine last month: In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, it would surely be insensitive, bordering on the incendiary, to roar out these hypocritical th-century words, with or without irony.Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically erse, criticised the song: It’s so irrelevant to today’s society.It’s been irrelevant for generations, and we seem to keep perpetuating it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government moved fast with financial help for the millions whose incomes were hit by Covid-. The self-employed and furlough schemes were hugely welcomed and the £ per week uplt in Universal Credit made a huge dference to some hard up families, but others missed out on gaining from it because of the benefit cap – being unable to work because of the lockdown meant that they couldn’t earn enough to escape the cap. But besides the extension of free school meal replacements over the summer there was nothing specically for families with children – nothing that recognised the extra costs of raising kids. So, as our survey shows, hard-pressed parents found that while their incomes were shrinking, costs were rising. During lockdown children still needed meals and they carried on outgrowing clothes and shoes. Most were worse off and half were much worse off than before the pandemic. Debt and stress levels escalated. Sadly, some parents blamed themselves for not having enough money to meet their children’s needs. Butthe pandemic has revealed anything it’s that our social security net has become too threadbare after years of cuts and freezes. It’s no longer fit for the job of protecting us when times are tough.

It was slow to provide protective kit, slow to protect care homes and slow to start testing. Even when they had the chance to learn from other countries, such as with the exams crisis, ministers have been caught on the hop. The shambolic efforts to reopen schools in England next month are a perfect example of mistakes not being learned from but repeated. The Government has had months to prepare for the new term, yet headteachers and parents cry out for clear guidance and support. Schools want to know what happensthere is a second spike. They want clarity on whether face coverings should be worn and how staff should interact with pupils. They also need help to pay for extra cleaning and equipment. It is not good enough for Boris Johnson to shout from the sidelines. We need him on the pitch addressing the real concerns of parents, pupils and teachers. Aid the needy  Even before the virus hit, far too many households struggled to make ends meet. Their plight has been made even worse as a result of the lockdown. An important study by the Child Poverty Group and the Church of England shows Britain’s poorest families have been left without the money to pay for food and utility bills. They are backing the Mirror’s call for an immediate increase in child benefit and the scrapping of the benefit cap. The Government has a warped sense of priorities when it is subsiding the wealthy to eat out but doing nothing to help the poorest. Raising child benefit by £ a week would lt at least , children out of poverty. If Boris Johnson is genuine about his wish to “level up” he would take this step now.

Boris Johnson has said that fully reopening schools to all year groups is his top priority, amid warnings that the y closure has been damaging to children. Hundreds of thousands of youngsters have not set foot in a classroom since March following the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown, and things will look a lot dferent when they go back.Parents in England could face sanctionsthey fail to send their kids to school, Downing Street has confirmed. It is an anxious time for parents and school staff, as new measures have had to be put in place to prevent the spread of the virus. Although some year groups were able toin June, September will be the first time primary and secondary schools have been fully reopened five days a week. Here we answer some of the questions that parents have been asking, using the current government guidelines. Do you have questions or concerns about ing to school  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror  Will I be finedI donapost send my children to school  You could be, yes. The government said it is mandatory for children to go back, unless they have very specic clinical reasons - and this will apply to a very small number. Although when schools partially reopened in March parents were told they would not face sanctions, this is not the case going into the September term. Authorities will be able to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices, in line with their codes of conduct. My child or a family member has been shielding, how are they affected  The governmentaposs shielding programme was paused at the start of August, with officials saying it is safe for children back to go to school. There may be exceptions on clinical grounds, but guidance says these will be rare. It is possible that local guidelines could be put in placeinfection rates rise in an area, however. The guidelines say: We now know much more about coronavirusand so in future there will be far fewer children and young people advised to shield whenever community transmission rates are high. Therefore, the majority of pupils will be able toto school.  Will children and staff have to wear masks in school  The government is sticking to its guns and saying it is will not make face coverings compulsory in English schools. A Number  spokesman said: “Our guidance does not recommend face masks in school, we acknowledge face coverings could obstruct communication between teachers and pupils.” Business secretary Alok Sharma said there are no plans to review this advice. The situation is dferent north of the border, with Scotland advising that secondary school pupils should wear masks in corridors, communal areas and school buses. Will school start and finishing times change  Potentially. Headteachers have been urged to considered staggered starting times in order to prevent dferent year groups congregating at the same time. The government guidance says: We know that travel to school patterns dfer greatly between schools. If those patterns allow, schools should consider staggered starts or adjusting start and finish times to keep groups apart as they arrive and leave school. Staggered start and finish times should not reduce the amount of overall teaching time.  What happensa child or staff member tests positive for coronavirus  If schools learn that a staff member or pupil has tested positive for Covid-, they must take swt action. Members of the local health protection team will assess who has been in close contact with the inidual - meaning they must self-isolate for  days. Close contact is defined as: direct close contacts - those who have had face to face contact with an infected inidual for anyof time, within  metre, including being coughed on, a face to face conversation, or skin-to-skin contact proximity contacts - those who have had extended close contact, within  to  metres for more than  minutes, with an infected inidualthose who have travelled in a car with an infected personCould my childaposs school be shutthere are a lot of cases  Yes. If there are two or more cases in  days, orabsence rates are high due to possible Covid-, a school may have an outbreak. In this case a risk assessment should be carried out and groups of pupils may be made to self-isolate. However closing schools is a last resort. The guidance says: If schools are implementing controls from this list, addressing the risks they have identied and therefore reducing transmission risks, whole school closure based on cases within the school will not generally be necessary, and should not be considered except on the advice of health protection teams.  What happensa child develops coronavirus symptoms while at school  The government says thata child becomes unwell while at school, they must be sent home immediately. If possible, the child should be moved to a room where they can be isolated behind a closed door, ideally with an open window. If this canapost be done, staff are advised to move them to an area at least two metres from anyone . Staff must wear PPEthey need to go within two metres of the child, and bathrooms must be cleaned and disinfected before theyaposre used by anyone . How will social distancing work  Again, looking at the governmentaposs guidance, inidual schools will have to find the approach that works best for them. The guidelines say: The overarching principle to apply is reducing the number of contacts between children and staff. This can be achieved through keeping groups separateand through maintaining distance between iniduals. But this is isnapost always easy - for younger children, the emphasis will be on keeping groups apart, for older children it will be on distancing.  Is it safe  The government has emphasised that schools must introduce enhanced cleaning, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often using standard products, such as detergents and bleach. Contact between iniduals must be minimised and social distancing maintained wherever possible. Schools will need to review their health and safety risk assessments. They will also have to employ essential measures including:a requirement that people who are ill stay at home robust hand and respiratory hygiene enhanced cleaning arrangements active engagement with NHS Test and Trace formal consideration of how to reduce contacts and maximise distancing between those in school wherever possible and minimise potential for contamination so far as is reasonably practicableMy child has complex needs that requires close contact, what will happen  The government says support will be provided as normal. While adults are advised to try and keep a distance from pupils where possible, it is recognised that this is not always possible. The guidance says:will not be possible when working with many pupils who have complex needs or who need close contact care. These pupils’ educational and care support should be provided as normal. Will school assemblies still be going ahead  There is no outright rule, but schools have been advised against it. The government says: Groups should be kept apart, meaning that schools should avoid large gatherings such as assemblies or collective worship with more than one group. Is there a risk of contracting the virus in corridors  Officials acknowledge that there is a risk, but says when passing briefly in corridors or in the playground, this is low. Schools should, however, consider staggered break and lesson times to avoid large groups congregating at entrances, exits and in corridors, they say.

Mercy contacted our charity on August  and said she was not getting any financial support yet had made an application to MigrantHelp. Had she lived she would have been a high priority for a crisis payment from our Emergency Relief Fund like hundreds of others left ally destitute by the asylum system. “The question remains, why are mothers and babies being left to go hungry in this city, why is it being left to charities and volunteers to pick up the pieces  Does society have anything to say about that other than call them a drain on society  The fact is there is no safety netyouaposre a refugee or migrant.

They only told their closest family and friends and ordered takeaways from their favourite restaurants rather than going out as they got to know each other. But on October , , they couldnapost hide it any more when news of their relationship was leaked. According to a new book about the couple, Finding Freedom, the leak came someone who works for Harryaposs cousin Princess Eugenie and her dad Prince Andrew. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: The Sunday Express was going to run with the story of their relationship - and the tabloid was rumoured to have been tipped off by an employee of none other than Eugenie and her father, Prince Andrew. Eugenie is extremely close to her cousin Harry, so itaposs likely that she was upset when she found out what happened - even though it wasnapost her fault. The two royals have been very close their whole lives, with their mums Princess Diana and Sarah Ferguson taking them on holiday together when they were kids. As they grew up, they took on the London clubbing scene together, sneaking into bars and doing shots together. Eugenie also played matchmaker to Harry before he met Meghan, setting him up with her actress friend Cressida Bonas. Scobie and Durand write: Eugenie has always been more than just a cousin to Harry. They were also the closest of friends. Out of all the Queenaposs grandchildren, Harry and Eugenie have one of the most natural connections. Like Harry, Eugenie is loyal, honest, and great fun. Like Harry, Eugenie also struggled to carve out her own identity growing up. Harry had always confided in his cousin when it came to the women in his le. Not only did he trust her implicitly, but friends say that she gives great advice and has always been beyond wise for her years.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed. Buckingham Palace is usually open to the public for  weeks each summer and selected dates during winter and spring. But due to the coronavirus pandemic it has remained closed to visitors after a decision made by the Royal Collection Trust last month because of the operational challenges of social distancing in their palaces and properties.

So when full stops are used in text, younger people often perceive it to be passive aggressive, and a sign of irritation.According to TheLeiden University’s Dr Lauren Fonteyn tweeted: If you send a text message without a full stop, it’s already obvious that you’ve concluded the message.Soyou add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.A  study from Binghamton University in New York involving  undergraduates, found that texts ending with a full stop were perceived as insincere, whereas messages ending with exclamation points are considered more heartfelt.Research leader Celia Klin explained that when talking in person itaposs much easier to convey emotion by using facial expressions, changing your tone of voice and eye contact. But these mechanisms canapost be used when texting. Therefore it makes sense that young people use Emojis, slang and punctuation to put across how theyaposre feeling. Professor David Crystal, one of the worldaposs leading language experts, argues that the meaning behind the usage of full stops is changing fundamentally.

And he predicts Jong-Unaposs younger sister will prove to be a cruel dictator.“The way for her to build up her credibility and net worth, that is, the way for her to get respect, is not to play nice but be a cruel dictator to her people and a credible nuclear threat to the US,” he told the New York Post.“She may prove herself fiercer and more tyrannical than her brother, father, or grandfather.” He saidYo-Jong does take power, she will need to be ruthless, particularly in the early years of her reign. Retired US Army Colonel David Maxwell agreed with Mr Leeaposs assertion. Col Maxwell helped devise the Pentagon’s  contingency plan with South Korea for the collapse of the North’s regime.  “I haven’t seen any evidence, any indication of how she might rule, but my speculation — given the reputation and history of the family — is that she would rule with an iron fist,” Col Maxwell said. Jong-Un was expected to be more open with the outside world when he succeeded his father Kim Jong II in . While that has not proved the case, his sister is expected to take a more abrasive stance. If she takes charge, her reign would likely be heralded by missile launches as a show of strength, according to Victor Cha, who was a director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council during the administration of former President George W. Bush.  He also predicted she would instigate a purge of government figures in order to install people loyal to herself, and would be a hard-liner with South Korea and the US. Reports that Jong-Un was in a coma circulated earlier this week, while rumours also surfaced that the North Korean leader may have died, having been seen in public only a handful of times this year. Chang Song-min, a former aide to South Korea’s late president Kim Dae-jung, insisted Jing-Un was still alive, telling reporters: “I assess him to be in a coma, but his le has not ended.

Coastguards who rescued the man, believed to be British, off the coast of Marbella have today released the image showing him wearing a le jacket over a white shirt. A spokesman for Spanish Coastguards said in a tweet: “Salvamar Vega yesterday rescued and took to Estepona a man discovered by a yacht  miles south-west of Marbella. “He was adrt on a surfboard. The man who was rescued said he had been at sea for three days after falling from a ship.” But the mystery surrounding the incident deepened today. Coastguards said he had told the yacht that spotted him and the rescue ship that took him to dry land suffering from hypothermia that he had been at sea for three days after “falling off a cruise ship or merchant vessel.” But police revealed the -year-old did not repeat his claims to them as they had taken him back to his Costa del Sol hotel after he received treatment at a local health centre. A spokeswoman for the Spanish Coastguards confirmed: “The alarm was sounded at . on Monday. “The crew of a yacht called Estelar contacted the emergency services to say they had come across a man on a surf board about  miles south-west of Marbella. “Coastguard vessel Salvamar Vega was sent from Estepona where it has its base to rescue him. “The operation was coordinated by our coastguard centre in Tara. “He was taken back to Estepona and handed over to police so he could be taken to a health centre as he was suffering from hypothermia. “He told the yacht crew and the coastguards that picked him up that he had been at sea for three days and that he had fallen off a ship he described at one point as a cruise liner and another as a merchant vessel.”  She added: “I haven’t got a full description of what he was wearing but I know he had a white shirt on. “The job of investigating what actually happened is a police job but we’ve not been aware of anyone falling or jumping from a cruise ship or merchant vessel in the area.” Responding to Spanish reports the man was British, she said: We didn’t see a passport but from the look of the man and the way he spoke, he appeared to be British.” A spokesman for the National Police in Malaga, who weren’t able to provide any immediate nationality information, said: The person in question said he was on holiday in the area and was assisted in getting back to the address where he said he was staying. “Ourhere has simply been a humanitarian one.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents force fed toddler hamburgers","story":"NewsParents of toddler accused of force-feeding her chicken and burgers for likesThe parents, who live in China, set up the account on Xigua Video and would upload videos of their daughter eating fried chicken, hamburgers, sausages, instant noodles and grilled meatsShareCommentsByAlex CopeDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video toddler-force-fed-fried-chicken-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The History of Dundee FC’ and ‘They Wore The Dark Blue’ books, told Tele Sport: “The season before they went to Dens Park,  , the club had gone for more high-profile players and had spent a lot of money on wages.“There were some controversial things happening, some disciplinary issues with players and then some directors not backing up other directors when it came to dealing with it.“To save money, they went with largely local lads the next season. I think the only top player they had was Sandy Keillor who was an outstanding player for a decade.“Dundee couldn’t pay off the debt, though, and were wound up. But the Scottish League stepped in, they wanted to keep a presence north of the Tay, and asked them not to pack in but to wait a while.“Essentially Dundee Football and Athletic Club liquidated and they played the last two games of the season with the new set-up under the name Dundee Football Club.“The club were fortunate that the lease for Carolina Port was changed for commercial use and the new like-minded committee moved to Dens Park.“There were now a group of like-minded people with the same drive and determination to grow the club. And the supporters responded.”Indeed, a packed Gilfillan Hall saw a new committee formed with the influential Bailie John Robertson appointed president.Soon, though, the club were without a home as their Carolina Port ground was being taken over by dock work.Gussie Park was considered before the committee settled on leasing some agricultural land alongside Provost Road and Dens Road.It was a steeply sloping bit of land but Robertson remarked the creation of the ground had been by “putting stout hearts to a stf brae” while the stand at Carolina Port was dismantled and rebuilt on the south side of the new pitch.The new era for Dundee Football Club started on August , , with , spectators and £-s-d – around £, today # taken at the gate.President Robertson kicked off for the visiting Edinburgh side St Bernard’s ahead of a - draw.Dundonian Fred McDiarmid made history by scoring Dundee’s first goal at Dens Park.Dens Park has been the scene of many happy memories for a great many people in its  year history.The ground has hosted a European Cup semi-final between the Dark Blues and AC Milan, a Fairs Cup semi-final with Leeds the visitors, three internationals between Scotland and Wales in ,  and  as well as two League Cup Finals in  and .Those were some of the great occasions but what does it mean to fans who have been heading through the turnstiles week after week, year after year Tele reader Malcolm Stewart has fond memories of watching Dave Curlett, Shug Reid, Jimmy Gabriel, Alan Cousin, Doug Cowie and many more in his early days at Dens.He said: “My first memory of going to Dens Park was when I was eight-years-old, so that would be . I went with my grandfather who had been supporting Dundee way before then.“My grandfather would take me to the Provie Road end but I was in the Main Stand for the big European games and that’s where I go now, too.  That stand has barely changed since!“I have a lot of memories about the  team, I was at Muirton for the league win. I think about half a million people say they were but I certainly was!“That team was outstanding and there was hardly ever any space anywhere in the stands in those days.“The TC Keay and Provie Road ends were open then of course, not the stands like they are now and there was an incredible atmosphere at Dens.“My favourite player was Charlie Cooke, he was something . He was later on after the European games and was only around for a couple of years but he was my favourite.“There have been plenty of good memories for me at Dens Park. Goodness knows what it will be like next season but I hope there are more to come.”The Main Stand at Dens, unique in its angled shape, will next year look back over a century of Dundee goals, moans and celebrations.Built in  by Archibald Leitch, whose other works include Old Trafford, Anfield, Goodison, Highbury, Hampden, Ibrox and Tynecastle among many more, the ‘bend’ in the middle was designed to ensure a great viewing angle whether watching from the middle or the ends of the stands.Just  years after almost being wound up, Dundee were making their presence in Scottish football felt.Price added: “The building of the stand in  was such an ambitious move. That showed from being almost liquidated  years previously and given a reprieve from the league to building one of the best stands in the country.”Thirty-two years later and the Main Stand, along with the other three sides were filled to the brim.A record , fans piled into the stadium to see a Scottish Cup second-round tie between the Dark Blues and Rangers.The Glasgow side would win - that day and go on to lt the cup as well as the ‘A’ Division title, as it was known then.The massive crowds wouldagain in the early s as the greatest Dundee team of all time celebrated their league success in  with a European adventure.Twenty-five thousand saw a Gilzean hat-trick as Bob Shankly’s Dark Blues thumped FC Cologne -, , saw another treble from Gilzean in a - victory over Sporting Lisbon and then just under , were there to see Alan Cousin and Gordon Smith see off Belgians Anderlecht in the quarter-final.Among those , was a young Norrie Price. He recalls: “I was there for what would be one of the top half-dozen attendances in what was only my second time at Dens at the age of .“Anderlecht with just short of , people at Dens Park was one of the greatest experiences of my le.“Anderlecht were a fabulous team as well, had just beaten Real Madrid. For the first  minutes it was just non-stop Anderlecht passing. Under the floodlights they had this white and mauve strip and played fabulous football. I was thinking ‘gosh, Dundee can’t get a hold of the ball!’“The experienced players helped and in the second half turned the game.“It was a fantastic atmosphere, electric. You could see puffs of smoke coming from supporters all over the ground whether the breath in the night air or cigarettes. There were lights all around the ground.“Big crowds have a le of their own and it absolutely hooked me forever.“First of all, just going to the game. It had been talked about for weeks. The newspapers were fantastic, had been talking about the game for ages and there were real souvenirs made.“Even now I have fabulous memories of all the build-up.”Gilzean would net nine times in that European run to the last four, stopped only by AC Milan, and scored a record  goals for Dundee.“Gilzean was my favourite,” added Price.“We used to pretend to be all the dferent players, Andy Penman, Alan Cousin, Alan Gilzean. Everyone wanted to be Gilzean because he scored the goals.“He had a tremendous burst of pace and would often be on the halfway line with teams trying to play offside.“It was a great team and the interchanging of passing was great to behold. You look at that era and there were so many heroes. Today the best teams have maybe three or four the kids like to pick out but it doesn’t happen so much now.“That night against Anderlecht it was Smith that made the dference, he transferred the ball from one foot to the other and wandered past the full-back and put it across for Penman. It was a goal out of nothing.”The Ibrox disaster of  saw regulations brought in and the days of huge crowds were over. Bench seats were installed which brought the capacity down from more than , to ,.Further improvements in fan safety saw that reduced even further during the s.Then , packed out the new-look Dens Park in December  as the eyes of the entire country were focused on the home of Dundee Football Club.For the second time in two years, the Scottish League Cup would be decided at Dens. This time the Dark Blues would be playing after rivals Dundee United had defeated Aberdeen in a replay of the - final the year before.The Tangerines were back to defend their trophy in what would be an all-Dundee affair, even referee Bob Valentine was local.Former Dark Blues inside forward Jim McLean, who turned out  times for the club, was in charge of United and leading them to their own glory days.Dundee were very much the underdogs, battling for promotion to the Premier Division, with United enjoying European football for the fourth-straight season.A first-half goal from Davie Dodds was added to by Paul Sturrock’s second-half brace as the Tangerines ran out - winners and lted the cup at the home of their rivals.Come the end of the campaign, it would be more cheerful for home fans at Dens Park with promotion secured at East Stirling thanks to an Eric Sinclair goal.Dundee historian Kenny Ross remembers that time as he began his love affair with the club.He said: “One of my early memories was in the run up to promotion in  .“I didn’t get to go to the League Cup Final in  at Dens, we couldn’t get tickets. My dad queued up but the shutters went up and we ended up watching it from the top of the Law with hundreds of others, from both sides, with the car radios on. It was packed up there. It was amazing.“Later that season, I remember going to a game against Berwick Rangers in March and being in the Stand Enclosure swinging my legs on the barriers! I think it finished - which tells you why I was doing that.“Myself and my dad then moved to the Provost Road end and watched games from the Bobby Cox until I started doing some of the media stuff for the club where I’m now at the back of the Main Stand.”He added: “There were , at that cup final. The last time the gates were shut were for a Skol Cup quarter-final, again against United, in  where , watched. The queues were horrendous that night before the gates closed.“The day Hearts lost the league at Dens in  was just under , and there were , in the ground when United won the league three years earlier.“The last time it was sold out was for the Championship win in  – that was a total sell-out against Dumbarton.”The next major changes came at the tail end of the th century with promotion to the top flight in  dependant on the redevelopment of Dens Park.Up came two near-identical stands at either end of the ground in record time, just  days, to meet the SPL’s required seating capacity.The Bob Shankly and Bobby Cox stands popped up and Dens Park as we recognise it today emerged into the new century.Along with the new millennium came glitz and glamour with the Bonetti revolution.Club stalwarts like Barry Smith and Gavin Rae were joined by Argentine great Caniggia and the likes of Georgi Nemsadze, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara to boost the average home gate to ,.Fans would also see a Champions League winner in Fabrizio Ravanelli and English Premier League star Temuri Ketsbaia turn out in dark blue at Dens Park before administration hit.Supporters once more stepped in to help save the club in  through another administration, just like they did  years before.Fast forward seven years and owners Tim Keyes and John Nelms revealed plans for a new stadium to take Dundee from Dens Park to a new home at Camperdown Park.Initial hopes were that would be ready for the start of the   campaign but funding issues and a global pandemic have delayed the first spade in the ground at ‘New Campy’, the fans’ name for the potential new ground.Whenever that might arrive to replace Dens, fans will continue to flock to their club’s home of  years.However, the next home match, a League Cup clash with Forfar on October , will be a competitive match like no other at the old ground.Depending on government guidelines at the time when the new season starts, there could be no fans there for a competitive fixture. At the very least there will be social distancing measures in place to combat spread of coronavirus.The days of , at Dens Park may be gone but that won’t stop thousands still wanting to get their fix of football from the Main Stand, South Enclosure, Bobby Cox or Bob Shankly.“It’s almost a marker for your year, when the first game at Dens is,” Price added.“We were looking forward to the better weather and the play-offs earlier this year but they didn’t happen. Reality kicked in and everyone was aware how dangerous a situation it is for everyone now.“When you see football where kicking off, you do feel left out. This situation shows just how much we take for granted.”Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history\" title\"#Andrew Nelson’s departure from Dundee this summer heralds the end of a chapter in the Dens Park club#s history# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-andrew-nelson-jim-mcintyre-james-mcpake embed # secretONRAQjKlL\" data-secret\"ONRAQjKlL\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

We believe people will chose to go to places that have clearly made reasonable adjustments to ensure, as best as they can, the safety of their staff and customers. In turn, each and every one of us must take personal responsibility for adjusting our own behaviours in those places.“The Chamber is also in discussion with MPs and other stakeholders to seek an extension to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme as we have been the only place in the UK unable to take advantage of it and this has proved highly successful in encouraging traffic through the doors in other areas.”The decision to allow pubs, cafes and restaurants to reopen will be subject to inspections by council environmental health officials, who are ensuring premises are adhering to Scottish Government guidance on physical distancing and hygiene.As of the weekend,  businesses had been contacted and assessed by the local authority, with further checks being carried out yesterday.Stephen Gow, the general manager of the Chester Hotel on Queens Road, revealed they will reopen their doors on Thursday # ing to the outdoor-only dining seen when the country took its first tentative steps back towards normality.He said: “We’re very much looking forward to reopening again on Thursday. Although we can move to an internal operation again, we believe that our customers value being outside in our marquees and this is how we will continue to operate in the coming weeks.#We were only operating for five days a week prior to the localised lockdown, but from Thursday we will be open seven days a week from  noon to am.#Mr Gow revealed the hotel had introduced a number of new safety measures in order to keep staff and customers safe.And he called on guests to be supportive of the measures as the city attempts to get moving once more.He added: “We’ve had to make minimal changes in order to reopen, as we’d always treated the guidelines as mandatory before they were legislated.#We will now, however, be taking the details of each household in a party and not just the lead booker’s details. We’ve also had new, larger tabletops created so that we can ensure, in line with environmental health advice, that households are kept at least one metre apart while they are seated.“We’ve been very supportive of the lockdown, as the safety of everyone in the city is of paramount importance.#It is important that hospitality businesses and their customers work in partnership to abide by safety guidelines and legislation for the good of the whole city. So, for example,you see your friends at a dferent table, it’s no longer permissible to stand and chat with them and our team will ask you to sit down again or to leaveyou are unwilling to do this.#We know that families have missed almost half a year of celebrations, but the maximum party size we can host is eight and this can be from no more than three households. We will be asking for proof of residence.#Hospitality businesses across the city desperately need the support of the guests in these changes.”A spokesman for HM Treasury said all Government support packages # including Eat Out to Help Out # are kept under review.He added: “Our Eat out to Help Out scheme is one part of our wider package of UK-wide support that has helped firms across the Scottish hospitality sector.“In total, , Scottish jobs have been protected through the furlough scheme, while , Scottish businesses have benefited from more £. billion of support through government-supported loan schemes.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Liversidge had been going to concentrate on Brexit, but Covid changed that.And yet it has all come together remarkably well, and a testament to the unique working conditions in which the artists found themselves in these last few months.Feeley tells me that Kaprow taught throughout his career, ldquoand most of what we consider his artworks were mainly done with students. The main thing he was interested in was giving a simple set of instructions, which could remain as ideas or proposals, and seem at face value simple and succinct, but then the real world hits, and when people try to follow his instructions, the problems of organisation are part of the piece. The only people who experience the happenings are the people making them themselves!Kaprow had been allowing other artists to reinvent his work since relatively early in his career, and these are the latest reincarnations.The first artwork greets you at the entrance gate, or more accurately smothers it, a barrage of Thank Yous painted by Wilsons during lockdown at the behest of Peter Liversidge. Liversidge has reworked Allan Kaprowrsquos Out Exit piece, originally created by Kaprow for Edinburgh in . The signs, brightly painted, make the entrance look like a maximised incarnation of the thank yous and rainbows placed in windows around the country over the last few months. The Wilsons have also recreated the artistrsquos Yard , blocking off their own driveway with a wall of used tyres.Liversidge, with his ldquoProposals, many of which are never carried out, is a fine fit for Kaprow, who suggested lsquohappeningsrsquo in similar vein. His ideas were off-centre, humorous, an interruption of daily le, call it what you will. In the Steadings gallery, the upper level has been cordoned off for a sign painter in Liversidgersquos reinvention of Kaprowrsquos only UK happening. There is a book provided, from which you can pick a legend to be painted on a cardboard sign to take away ndash a donation is suggested.The phrases are all taken from the words of students from around the country, part of Jupiterrsquos Youth Council, whom Liversidge spoke with prior to and during lockdown, to listen to their thoughts and concerns. From ldquoDoes the hawk see us too  to ldquoThe sound of the wind in the pines, each phrase a skein of a le that thought it during lockdown, a human concern, packed in amongst many.Upstairs in the Tin Roof Gallery, Cinzia Mutigli has created a piece that takes its inspiration from Sweet Wall, Kaprowrsquos  ldquopolitical parody, as he called it, in which he built a concrete wall, joined together with slabs of bread and jam, on a piece of wasteland near the Berlin Wall.Mutiglirsquos work, which comes closest, as Feeley points out, to fulfilling the idea of a reinvention, deals in sugar and postcolonial identity, the film an overload of words and ideas and patterns repeated over and over, sledgehammer-like, as the viewer sits and watches in the repeat-pattern wallpapered room, whilst munching Mutiglirsquos homemade jam sandwiches.Itrsquos an overwhelming piece, and one which is very personal, in that lockdown has made this film largely of the artist, the narrative a mix of personal experience and ldquoexpert analysis, each filtering in and out of comprehensibility.In the Ballroom Gallery, James Hoff, based in New York, has used a short recording made by Kaprow on how to make a happening, broadcast it to a number of radios and made up thousands of copies of original posters Kaprow made to advertise his happenings, for visitors to take away free.They are also available in art bookshops across Scotlandfor those who cannot travel to Jupiter.

Harold Wilsonrsquos Labour Government then set up a Royal Commission on the UK constitution in , recommending a devolved Scottish Assembly which was never implemented.The Scottish Constitutional Convention was formed in , comprised of representatives from local government, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the Small Business Federation, the Church of Scotland and all political parties except the Conservatives, in an effort to devise a scheme for the formation of a devolution settlement. The SNP chose to withdraw from the convention as independence was not a constitutional option, and it subsequently collapsed.Ultimately in  the Labour Government under Tony Blair promised the creation of devolved institutions and a referendum was held later that year and the Scottish Parliament was re-created as a result of the Scotland Act of . Mr Blair therefore was instrumental in firing the starting pistol on the final stretch of the road towards Scottish independence by establishing devolution in an effort to silence the SNP for several generations.When a new state of the art parliament building was built, with many devolved powers granted and a large clutch of MSPs in situ a complete parliamentary machine was gted to the SNP on a plate. The only fly in the ointment is Boris Johnson, who resolutely refuses to grant a Section  order, not to mention the many compelling arguments against the breakup of the Union. On the other hand the BBC has contributed to the recent rise in support for independence by affording Nicola Sturgeon a  to grandstand on national television almost every day for the past five months. I donrsquot blame her for jumping at the chance to place the SNP firmly in front of the nation by leading these sessions and it is plain for all to see that she enjoys basking in the limelight. We all need to be briefed on developments in respect of Covid- but a short bulletin a couple of times per week would suffice.Nevertheless it has taken  years for the SNP fortunes to reach the point where independence could be imminent and it is high time for the Unionists to wake up and become more vocal before the May Holyrood elections precipitate a landslide into oblivion.Christopher H Jones, Gfnock.UK press and media cite Business for Scotland Panelbase and Times YouGov August  poll figures respectively of  per cent and % support for Scottish independence. These figures exclude Donrsquot Knows and are partial, inflated \"headline figures\" that provide a basis for misleading reporting.Actual Panelbase and YouGov poll figures respectively show For % and %, Against % and %, Donrsquot Knows % and % . These produce simple averages of For .%, Against .%, Donrsquot Knows %.Support for independence has been rising over , is clearly higher than for remaining within the UK and lies around % . However, whether or not there is majority support for independence is not proven and there has not yet been sustained majority support over a period of time demonstrated for independence. There is therefore no convincing opinion poll case at present to support a second independence referendum. Nor has there been any reversal of the  Referendum   result, contrary to the misleading statement by Business for Scotland .Use of actual poll figures including Donrsquot Knows at the \"headline level\" are essential for objective use of statistics and balance of reporting.Whether or not the Panelbase poll of a % majority for independence continues to be reflected across dferent polls and strengthens over a sustained period of time is an issue, though so also is what happens to the Donrsquot Knows.The level of support for Scotland remaining within the UK has fallen signicantly since  at currently .% , a reflection of Scottish views on Brexit and Conservative governments since  the success of the SNP and First Minister on public perceptions of performance and confusion over UK and Scottish government responsibilities.Dont Knows might well be expected though to vote for the status quo given financial uncertainties and risks. YouGov states \"polling has shown % think the country would be worse off economicallyindependent, compared to % who think better off\". Adding together the above averaged Against and Dont Knows would produce a . .% result against Scottish independence. This is an uncertain proposition that could only be tested in a referendum, but is as much a reasonable proposition for consideration and debate as using partial inflated   and   figures that exclude Donrsquot Knows.John Garrity, Chichester.PETER A Russells concern for Alex Salmond and Scotlands justice systemhas a hollow ring to it, but I agree thatthere was a plot to have Mr Salmond thrown into jail for crimes he did not commit, it is certainly a most serious matter. Surely,anyone has evidence of such a thing the correct procedure would be to immediately contact the police, as the withholding of evidence is also a serious crime.However, I strongly suspect that, in the first place, there is no evidence because there was no plot, and in the second place, that Mr Russells demand for justice to be done is more to do with the latest opinion poll, showing support for Scottish independence now standing at  per cent, rather than any real concern for Mr Salmond and the justice system.Ruth Marr, Stirling.It is touching to witness Peter A Russells eagerness to see Alex Salmond obtain justice for himself and Scotlands criminal justice system. In support, he cites the observations of another two of yesterdays men, Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill.I am afraid that the latter lost a lot of my respect due to his handling of the Al-Megrahi situation. Dr Jim Swire tirelessly pursued the need for a review of the case providing evidence of several flaws in the trial in the Hague carried out under the jurisdiction of the Scottish justice system. Mr MacAskill refused to accept that there was any doubt as to Al-Megrahis guilt and he defended the Crown Prosecution services evidence virtually without question. Thereafter, he could not arrange the transfer of the convicted man to Libya quickly enough. This may well have been the start of the downturn of his own political career.It saddens me that Mr Salmond and the others cannot accept their diminished influence in the SNP and appear intent on undermining the cause of independence that they have worked so hard to deliver. The former party leader has been cleared of all charges against him even though his reputation has been tarnished by some of his own admissions during the trial. He has little to gain from washing any dirty linen in public, an outcome which Mr Russell is clearly hoping will damage the cause of independence which he hates so much.Gordon Evans, Burnside.I PREFACE my comments by saying there is no acceptable level for crimes against the person including sexual assault and rape. However, itrsquos appalling and a sad indictment of pathetic state of the opposition at Holyrood that Tory MSPS Liam Kerr would attempt to make political capital out of a blip in Julyrsquos sexual crime statistics . When taken in conjunction with the previous three months the levels of sexual crimes are actually substantially reduced.If Mr Kerr believes Police Scotland is underfunded then perhaps he could do something constructive and ask his masters in Westminster to increase the Block Grant after all what Westminster begrudgingly gives Holyrood to run the country is less than half the revenue generated in Scotland.David J Crawford, Glasgow G.ON Friday Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard delivered a keynote speech, unveiling plans to transform the Scottish economy. It included calls for a \"green new deal\" to tackle the economic crisis and climate change jointly and included some key proposals: poundm investment in electric buses, roll-out of electric vehicle charging points, extending free bus travel to under- s.Those proposals read like plagiarism. All Mr Leonardrsquos proposals were taken forward in the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Budget when the SNP set aside pound. billion of capital investment in projects to reduce emissions, investment in electric vehicles and extended free bus travel to under-s.

Gone was the sales conference meets Christmas party atmosphere of old, complete with pop music and balloons. Even the firework display looked asit was trying hard to be modest.A stellar line up of speakers, led by Michelle Obama, and slick production , still made it a television event that more than  million Americans watched each night.

Job done, everyone happy.Will the Republicans be saying the same come Thursday night  Whatever happens, the event is not the one the party wanted. Organisers tried to get as close to the convention norm as possible, but that plan was scrapped as the death toll from Covid- continued to soar.Instead, there will be a mix of in-person events, with an audience in Washington of no more than  people, and speeches from the key players at ious locations.On Thursday the President will accept the nomination at the White House, defying critics who say the residence should not be used for party political purposes. The First Lady, Melania Trump, will take to the podium in the White House rose garden tomorrow, hoping to follow the success of Jill Biden, who filmed a video in the school in which she once taught.Kellyanne Conway, senior adviser to Mr Trump, has promised a move away from what she called the ldquodour and sour mood of the Democratic National Convention. There has already been controversy over the guest spot given to lawyers Mark and Patricia McCloskey, the couple from St Louis who were pictured outside their mansion pointing guns at Black Lives Matters protesters in June.Mr Trump is expected to speak every night, andhis recent White House press conferences are any guide, viewers should expect the unexpected. Not given to delivering tightly scripted addresses, the President could find himself wandering far off topic. Any over-running will not go down well with television networks and viewers waiting for their shows to start.What a change it will be for a candidate who is at his happiest when he is speaking to his base in some vast auditorium.

Mr Trump has been trying out ious lines for size, accusing Mr Biden and his Veep nominee Kamala Harris of being prisoners of the left. A heavy emphasis on law and order and protecting the suburbs is expected. But how personal can he be in attacking his opponents  This is not  when he questioned the integrity of Hillary Clinton, and encouraged his supporters to do the same. Voters may accept that from a candidate, but not a President.Perhaps the best the Republicans can expect from their unconventional convention is to get through it without any major gaffes.

The polls in  showing Yes at over  per cent. The ldquosurge in SNP membership. The marches. All of them have been declared as signs that the momentum is with Yes and the same inevitably happened this week with the polls showing Yes on % and %. Forgive meI donrsquot get overly excited.But we shouldnrsquot be unduly cynical either. In private, senior figures in the SNP say the tipping point they really need is % and one of the first steps towards achieving % is saying you have momentum, whether itrsquos true or not. Itrsquos the faith factor that can attract believers which is why Nicola Sturgeon keeps doing it and was doing it again this week. The new polls, she said, showed that ldquothe momentum is very clearly with us.:Veteran SNP MSP calls for complete re-write of independence caseThe second step in the process, the other factor you need to reach %, is capitalising on the momentum you actually have, but thatrsquos a tricky one for the SNP because itrsquos not clear whatrsquos causing the recent rise in support. It could be Brexit, but then again the SNPrsquos big hope in  was that the result of the EU referendum would lead to a surge for them but it pretty much failed to materialise. Indeed, the First Ministerrsquos attempts to link Brexit with a second independence referendum led to the SNP suffering big losses at the General Election in .Alternatively, the latest encouraging polls for the SNP could be down to coronavirus and the fact that people seem pleased with the SNPrsquos handling of it. Ms Sturgeon says herself she believes this to be a factor ndash ldquoshow not tell she calls it ndash but itrsquos a hard trend to capitalise on isnrsquot it  If it was Brexit fuelling support for Yes, the SNP could keep on capitalising on itthe economy suffers. Butitrsquos coronavirus thatrsquos boosting support, the crisis will eventually fade and it may take some of the new support with it.Stage three on the road to % ndash building momentum beyond your core groups ndash is also quite hard to work out. Itrsquos clear that most of the sht from No to Yes has happened among Labour voters the firmest support for Yes is also still clustered around cities and the more deprived parts of those cities. But to get independence to the -plus zone that devolution reached  years ago, you need the momentum to get beyond those hard cores.Ms Sturgeon acknowledged this herself in  when she said that what really built the momentum for devolution in the s was the involvement of people beyond party politics. ldquoThe churches, trade unions, writers, artists, business people, she said, ldquothey all had their say and they were driving forces in building the momentum that led Labour to promise a referendum and the people of Scotland to vote for a Parliament with tax ying powers. If the SNP is to get % for independence, it needs the same kind of trend.But itrsquos stage four that could really take the Yes side over the line because itrsquos often the point where the process is almost impossible to reverse. Behaviourists call it ldquosocial herding and what it means is that when a politician or cause appears to be popular, people will gravitate towards it because itrsquos popular therersquos also a certain part of the electorate that will want to be on the winning side. Again, you saw some of that in the s with devolution it got to the point whereyou didnrsquot support a Scottish Parliament, you were a bit of a freak and itrsquos not always easy to stick to a beliefyou think everyone  thinks dferently. Itrsquos social herding that will take us over the line to  plus.Which leaves the question of where Scotland actually is in the four-stage process and I think the answer to that is not as far as some in the SNP think. Therersquos no denying the upward trend for Yes, and therersquos probably been a sht because of coronavirus, but we will have to wait to seethe SNP really is in stage two and can capitalise on whatrsquos happening.As for stage three ndash reaching out beyond the hard core ndash again therersquos not much evidence yet of support changing except in the soft middle which wersquove known for a while now is prone to shting back and forth. Itrsquos also worth remembering political scientist John Curticersquos point that support for Yes may come down again under the sustained attack there will be on independence in the event of a second referendum. In other words, momentum can go down as well as up.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceAnd therersquos another factor which may be more important than momentum anyway. As Irsquove already pointed out, who you are and where you live was a massive factor in how you voted on independence: well-off areas voted No, poorer areas voted Yes. But demographics change and, in the end, this could be whatrsquos really critical for the independence case.First, coronavirus and Brexit will make a lot of us poorer and nationalism does well in economies that are struggling ndash so the harder le gets for people, the more likely they are to be tempted by Yes. But secondly, support for independence is higher among under-s than it is among older people and the laws of demographics are clear on that one: the second group is going to get smaller. Political views can change as you age of course, but the demographic destiny looks undeniable.The question of momentum is much less certain. I know Nicola Sturgeon says she has it, but she said the same thing in  and  and look what happened then. But there are signs of change and as soon as therersquos an indication that the coronavirus effect is sticking or that support for independence is reaching beyond the hard core, thatrsquos when the momentum could really get going. Thatrsquos when % could become an achievable goal. Thatrsquos when independence will become unstoppable.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Despite some bold action, last week the Scottish Government published their second annual progress report revealing that one in four children are still trapped in poverty.We all know that this is unacceptable. We know that this can change because we have done it before. But to achieve real change in the circumstances we now face will require a signicant increase in the scale and impact of investment across three main areas ndash employment, social security, and housing.The Scottish Government is right to highlight that independent forecasts, published in , predicted that child poverty rates would increase by , largely in response to UK Government welfare reforms. While child poverty rates may have stabilised before the pandemic, we expect an economic storm to create greater risks. Those of us restless for no child to grow up in poverty must not lose our resolve.The roll back of UK Government furlough and self-employment support schemes will see further income shocks and stronger headwinds for families in the Autumn. We are expecting to see unemployment rise and rising debt levels as families grapple with the gap between falling incomes and additional costs, with many risking falling behind with rents and mortgages.At the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we are deeply concerned at the degree of financial strain and uncertainty felt by many families. Currently, seven in  families with children on low incomes are having to cut back on essentials. Families who were already struggling to keep their heads above water are now feeling the full force of the economic storm caused by Covid-.It is imperative that we put in place a stronger leline for these families now or we risk making the challenge of tackling child poverty in Scotland much harder in the future.Many positive steps are already being taken ndash but together their impact does not rise to the scale of the challenge we face nor provide enough targeted support for families.Our first priority must be to avoid rising unemployment leading to a surge in poverty. Government and employers need to work in partnership to urgently create new good jobs and equip Scots with the skills they need to access them.While the UK Governmentrsquos Kickstart scheme will play a key role in guaranteeing young people work for at least twelve months, itrsquos vital that this support is extended to over-s and other groups who already faced additional barriers in the jobs market before the recession.Extra resources being committed to the Parental Employment Support Fund over the next year offer potentially crucial support to help parents find the best combination of hours, earnings, and childcare to improve their prospects. To be effective, we need to see better alignment between local economic development strategies and this investment ndash boosting the supply of, and access to, good quality, flexible jobs with opportunities to progress.Sadly, we know that we are living through one of the deepest economic downturns on record and job losses are inevitable. Therefore, strengthening our social security system so that it protects people from being pulled into poverty and debt will be essential.We welcome the Cabinet Secretary Aileen Campbellrsquos commitment to prioritise the Scottish Child Payment and begin payments to low-income families with children under six by the end of February. However, as local lockdowns and ongoing social restrictions are likely to remain in place for some time, plans must be implemented to ensure that enough support reaches those who are struggling now.Many across Scotland face uncertainty about whether they will be able to access a decent home or keep the one they currently have. It is right that the Scottish Government has indicated it will act to avoid a potential Autumn spike in evictions, by extending legal protections until the end of next March.This is a vital first step, but also needs to be complemented by genuinely affordable rent repayment plans that balance the needs of tenants and landlords. Where this cannot be achieved, the Government should be ready to step in.All that said, there is no route to achieving the child poverty targets without many more families being able to access good quality, social housing. We need the Scottish Government to go well beyond its current plan, by offering greater certainty to the sector and bringing forward a credible plan to deliver affordable homes at scale during the next Parliament.The upcoming Programme for Government offers an opportunity for ministers to set out a clear plan to get us back on course in righting the wrong of child poverty.

The punctuation mark, it has been revealed, is seen as unnecessary and maybe even intimidating by younger people when it comes to social media conversations. Is this the end of the period Letrsquos get some context. How long has the full stop been around In its current form perhaps not as long as you think. The arrival of the printing press in the middle of the th century and the publication of Johannes Gutenbergrsquos Bible formalised punctuation in texts. Before that it had an up and down existence. In the third century BCE a librarian called Aristophanes introduced dots on the page as pauses. But this was of no interest to the ancient Romans who saw no need for spaces or punctuation in writing, mostly because writing was seen as something to be read aloud.It was early Christianity, which was devoted to the written word, that helped revive the idea of punctuation. In the seventh century Isidore of Seville introduced his own system of dots to indicate pauses, including the distintio finalis to indicate an end point.Monks played around with punctuation over the following centuries until printing set the punctuation marks we know today in ink, as it were.So, whatrsquos changed Social media. Text messaging is short and succinct. Itrsquos often only a few words long and punctuation isnrsquot really needed. Hitting send is now the equivalent of the full stop. As a result, for some younger users itrsquos now thought that when punctuation is used they find it odd.Is this more snowflake behaviour Have you been reading Jeremy Clarkson columns again  What in fact is happening is the evolution of written language in the face of new technological developments. When used in social media the full stop has acquired extra layers of meaning. As itrsquos not seen as necessary, its inclusion therefore implies means more than just an end to a sentence. Linguists suggest that to the social media generation, it can be seen as abrupt, negative, or even angry.The other interesting Twitter development is the use of the written words ldquoFull Stop to indicate that whatever precedes it settles an argument. In short, the humble periodhas become a tool in debate.Is anything taking the place of the full stop Online, the use of the exclamation mark is increasingly more common as a form of emphasis. And, of course, we are all using emojis now.So, how long before the full stop disappears Full stops in documents, letters, books or even in the very newspaper yoursquore currently reading, arenrsquot going anywhere soon. Theyrsquore still quite useful, unsurprisingly, and the connotations attached to them remain more neutral in print than they do online. In short, you canrsquot stop using them.

Gerrymandering is an attempt to establish a political advantage for a particular party or group by adjusting district boundaries. Mr Russell alleges, but technically in error, what could be considered a iant of gerrymandering by expanding, or restricting, the voter pool for political advantage. The Scottish Government has engaged in iant gerrymandering by conferring voting rights upon those aged  years or older.

You need an initial vertical drop of at least m , usually more like m , that is steep enough to fly over after the start height.ldquoThen you need enough overall altitude to make the flight last more than a few seconds ndash so usually more than m .ldquoAnd, of course, you need a good place to land. ldquoIf any of these things are missing or slightly lacking, then you need one of the other iables to have more margin.ldquoFor example,your start height is less than mthen you want the terrain to be very steep underneath so you can have a greater marginyou fly at a greater ratio than the slope.Mr Howell, who is married to fellow base jumper Ewa Kalisiewicz but has no children, says the UK is ldquoundiscovered in terms of base jumping sites.

Indeed, Croatia seems a kind of idyll, where people are behaving fairly normally, though they wear masks on the bus or in shops, and restaurants are especially diligent about wiping down the tables.But itrsquos doing much the same as Italy and Spain did, and the recent rise in the virus is similar to other Continental countries. Restrictions are still widely accepted, evengrumbling has got louder as time goes on, and the inconsistencies in the policies seem more obvious.I took my chances that quarantine might be reintroduced during my stay ndash as did those heading for Spain, or Portugal, or even France ndash and at least wersquore still allowed to question the effectiveness of the ious governmentsrsquo measures to contain coronavirus.Doing so in some other post-Communist regimes, however, seems to be hazardous to health, given the surprising number of doctors in Russia who have fallen out of windows after questioning the countryrsquos Covid strategies. Therersquos a similar intolerance of dissent in Belarus, which today marks the th anniversary of its independence. There, questions of social distancinghave been shunted to the side as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets to oppose Alexander Lukashenkorsquos regime.Thatrsquos something you may think an odd response days after an electionit was won with  per cent of the electorate endorsing it, as Mr Lukashenko, in post since , maintains. It seems suspiciously of a piece with Mr Putinrsquos remarkable political longevity, and the unfortunate tendency of his opponents to end up in jail, go down with mysterious poison-related illnesses or fall out of windows.A look at the relative positions of countries that were once Communist suggests that there is quite a ide in the degree to which they now conform to western norms of liberalism, democracy, fair elections, freedom of the press and liberty of the average citizen. Croatia doesnrsquot now feel all that dferent from other Mediterranean holiday destinations ndash and thatrsquos despite the fact that, coincidentally, today also marks the th anniversary of the start of the Siege of Vuko, reminding us that it, and its FRY neighbours, were in a bitter war for much of the s.Things are not politically perfect in the region , but like most previously Communist countries west of Minsk, the Yugosphere nations now look like other European countries. Germany is entirely integrated: Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are mainstream European, indeed EU, countries the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have the dubious distinction of being as familiar to British partygoers on a stag night as Blackpool or Benidorm.They certainly deserve to be compared on most indices of economic and political freedom,not with the UK, France and Germany, with Greece, Italy and Portugal. Even worries about nationalism or corruption in, say, Hungary, are still more like similar concerns about Malta than Azerbaijan.Yet, with the exception of the Baltic states, always western-looking, shrugging off Communism in the early s has not automatically led to freedom for the countries that suffered under it, and the distinction is between post-Communist and post-Soviet nations.On the whole, the Communist countries of Europereacted to its fall by moving towards the democratic and economic principles of the West: capitalism, or at least social democracy that recognises property rights, the importance of free trade, and the rights and freedoms of the inidual.A few are still ldquotransitional or ldquohybrid regimes or, like Montenegro, have drted backwards, but none is like Belarus, Azerbaijan, Russia or the five ldquoStans to the south of it ndash all of which are ldquoconsolidated authoritarian regimes ie, dictatorships.This provides a pretty dramatic illustration of the lie that is so popular with those who still think Communism was a pretty good idea .It turns out that capitalism or neoliberalism or free markets or classical liberal principles do not thinly disguise oppression, but are principles that make their citizens more free and prosperous. Itrsquos when you ditch Communism, but donrsquot make any attempt to replace its flawed ideology with that of the nations that were on the right side of the Cold War that you get genuine oppression, assaults on freedom and the same dictatorial gangsters in charge, just in dferent suits, and on bigger yachts.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

Covid- infections in Birmingham.The latest Birmingham City Council-proposed steps were approved after local authority chiefs met with the Governmentrsquos gold command, and come on the back of concerns about a recent rise in infections in the city- although the rate is now falling.The city was placed on the Governmentrsquos national watchlist on Friday as an ldquoarea of enhanced support, meaning it would be provided with extra resources and support to help boost testing and manage outbreaksneeded.The move came after Birminghamrsquos seven-day infection rose above  cases per , at one stage earlier in August.However, the latest figures show the rate holding at about  cases, according to data from NHS Digital.The councilrsquos focus is now on keeping Covid- under control as school pupils prepare toto the classrooms and thousands of university students are expected back at lectures.In a statement, the local authority said the ldquoenhanced measures would tackle the fact much of the current guidance in force is ldquonot legally enforceable.City council chiefs said making the changes ldquostrengthens our position to take action where required.The measures give powers to council officers and police to warn and,necessary, shut businesses like restaurants and bars,they are failing to manage Covid- risk properly and keep the public safe.The powers would also give authority to ban events, including weddings and funerals, based on maximum size limits, and restrict access or close public outdoor spaces and parks, in the interests of public health. vw,vw,px, px\"The city is on a Government watchlist for lsquoenhanced supportrsquo after the Covid- infection rate rose earlier this month Earlier this month, the council warned premises of a crackdown as the infection rate began to rise, amid a noticeable ldquodropping-off at pubs in particular, in recording of customersrsquo names and addresses for test and trace purposes.On Wednesday, a pub in the Hockley area of the city became the first in Birmingham to have its licence suspended for continual breaches of Covid- measures.The PBrsquos bar had been reported for at least seven breaches of the Government guidelines in August before a closure notice was slapped on the premises, with a full licensing review set to take place next month.The new measures will also allow the shutting of public spaces on public health grounds, amid a rise in gatherings where social distancing is being flouted.West Midlands Police said it had to disperse up to  people from a park in the neighbouring Solihull local authority area on Saturday, and broke up  illegal gatherings across the region, including Birmingham. vw,vw,px, px\"Leader of Birmingham City Council Ian Ward Ian Ward, Birmingham City Council leader, said: ldquoThese new powers will allow us to intervene when businesses are putting staff and customers at risk of infection.ldquoBy all working together to take action now, we can hopefully bring the numbers down, prevent further restrictions and protect the health and jobs of people across the city.Mr Ward said: ldquoWhile the recent figures show our rates are going down, we cannot be complacent.ldquoWe must all continue to follow all the relevant safety guidance in order to protect our families, friends and work colleagues.ldquoMost importantly staying disciplined now is a price worth paying when compared to the cost of damaging the future le chances of our cityrsquos children ndash which may happenthere is a spike in the rate of infections and schools have to close, or parents do not send them due to concerns about the potential risks.ldquoWhile the impact of Covid- may be felt over the next few years, the negative impacts upon children not being present at school will last a letime.He added that staying within the guidelines would support the cityrsquos ldquofragile economic recovery.Mr Ward said while most businesses were following the rules, it was introducing new powers ldquofor those that are not.He added: ldquoWe want citizens to be able to feel safe when they support the local economy, soyou are eating out or just going for drinks remember the restaurant or bar should be asking for your contact details and the staff should be doing all they can to make you comfortable.ldquoIf not then you can leave and make the council aware of your concerns.The council launched a whistleblower hotline last week allowing people to report businesses flouting Covid- rules, either online or over the phone.Earlier this week, the city councilrsquos ex-leader Professor John Clancy branded preparations for a local lockdown in Birmingham ldquoridiculous.He said other big cities and built-up areas had ldquofared far worse, pointing out Birmingham was th in the table of English and Welsh councils for Covid--related deaths.Prof Clancy said ldquojust-in-case lockdowns based on what he claimed was ldquododgy data were unacceptable.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-.

Meanwhile, the number of Covid- positive inpatients across Northern Ireland had dropped from  to nine. It is thought the drop in newly diagnosed cases from  on Sunday to  yesterday is as a result of the discovery of a number of clusters. A health service source said peaks and troughs in the figures are not unexpected and demonstrate that Northern Ireland#s Test Trace Protect system is working efficiently. However, they warned that further spikes are likely.According to the figures released yesterday, , people were tested over the previous  hours, resulting in the  positive cases. The number of people who have tested positive over the last week stands at . Mid and East Antrim and Belfast have had the highest number of positive cases over the last week, with  and  cases confirmed respectively. There were also nine active care home outbreaks yesterday, according to the latest figures. There are concerns that, as the number of cases of Covid- increase, residents of care home residents are more likely to become seriously ill or even die from the virus. Last week, Health Minister Robin Swann was forced to defend the decision to reimpose lockdown measures, including the closure of a food manufacturing plant that had been hit by a cluster. Speaking at a press conference to announce new measures Mr Swann said his experts have warned him to expect a rise in the number of hospital admissions in coming weeks to coincide with the increase in cases. He said: The reason we have nobody in ICU at this minute in time is because the last patient we had in ICU passed away. He didn#t get up and recover and walk out, so let#s not use these stats without forgetting that there#s people and families behind it.

At the moment people cannot even apply for a test, she said. I understand some of those young people have been told it could be next year before they will be able to take a driving test.It has also revealed that learner drivers who were due to sit a driving test in Craigavon are being sent to Armagh and Lisburn instead.This situation is untenable and places local motorists at a distinct disadvantage, said Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: The DVA has worked hard to restore services and communicate the facts to all customers. It is vitally important that health and safety is put first while working to minimise disruption.On July  the minister announced that the DVA is planning to resume some practical car and lorry driving tests from September . The DVA holds the contact details of around , driving test candidates who are either key workers, or who had a test booked and cancelled in late March to the end of June. When driver testing resumes around  key workers will be tested first.The DVA estimates it will take six to eight weeks to clear the backlog. A further update will be provided to advise when it is opening its booking system for all new customers.

His body was found in a storm drain in north Belfast six days later and coroners later found he had died by drowning.In an interview posted on the @MyNoah Twitter account, Niamh Donohoe thanked those who had helped them search for Noah. From the first day of the search I was in north Belfast helping and looking for Noah, she said, seated next to her sister Fiona. The people of north Belfast, I was humbled by their kindness. They came from all over but anybody in that area just opened their doors to us.

They opened the Hub, the community centre - that was the base for all of us, the family, it was made very clear to us that we were welcome there at all times and any time. Search and rescue were there, we all came and went freely, we were comforted in there, all the ladies from the community - food and water in abundance. That was quite special, she said. On June , a vigil was held for Noah in what Ms Donohoe described as a special experience. They had arranged a vigil and we came across unaware of what was going to take place but it was special. All the familiar faces that had helped us, and people who I now keep contact with were all there.

Sinn Feacutein’s Karen Mullan has voiced her ‘disappointment and concern’ at the ‘unwillingness’ of Robin Swann to provide essential funding to keep Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Servicerunning. While the SDLP’s Mark H Durkan said like everything asked for in the North West it has become a ‘whole battle’. He described the service as a ‘huge success’ which has been a literal ‘leline’ to many. Bereaved local families, activists and organisations campaigned for a service of this kind for years. googletag.cmd.push CCIS provides a ‘safe space’ for those in crisis from pm on Thursdays until am on Sundays when many other services are not operational. It is run by Extern NI from the Holywell Building on Bishop Street. People experiencing a mental health crisis are referred to the service by the PSNI and Foyle Search  Rescue or attend of their own volition. Iniduals receive immediate support forgoing the need to attend a busy hospital Emergency Department. They are also directed to additional support servicesnecessary. An independent Ulster University report found the service to be cost-effective. Figures released by the Western Trust demonstrate the need for enhanced mental health provision in the city. googletag.cmd.push At the end of June  people were waiting more than nine weeks to access adult mental health services. There were  young people waiting more than nine weeks to access child and adolescent mental health services , as of June . Foyle Search  Rescue has also responded to many emergency incidents in recent months despite a period of lockdown. ‘UNTHINKABLE’ Karen Mullan said the minister has declined requests from her and party colleagues to meet to discuss the need to fund the CCIS and mental health services in the city. She added: “Derry City and the North West area a is being neglected by the Minister and his unwillingness to invest in mental health support services. “The Community Crisis Intervention Service is a service dealing with iniduals who are facing a crisis and need de-escalation. “This crisis can be due to a mental health episode or as a result of substance misuse. “All these issues fall firmly under the remit of the Department for Health and as such the minister. “Icallon Minister Swann to provide the funding for the Intervention service and investment in mental health provision in the City.” In June the health minister visited Derry where he announced pound, of additional funding to keep the service running for three months. Mark H Durkan said it is impossible to measure the positive impact it has had and he ‘shuddered’ to think about what could have happened without it. He continued: “We were able to convince the Minister to extend funding on an interim basis. “We have to remember that tackling the mental health crisis is an Executive priority so it’s not just one for the Department of Health. “They’ve made positive noises but that has to be backed by action and for me it is unthinkable that this service wouldn’t be funded moving forward.” The Foyle MLA said it is unacceptable for service users and hard-working staff to keep getting word of short extensions and that a permanent commitment must be made. A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council acknowledged that the funding provided would allow for the temporary continuation of the service. However, councillors are of the view that the Department of Health and other government departments should consider a ‘long-term funding arrangement’. In response, a DoH spokesperson said: “The additional funding provided by the Department of Health enabled Derry Crisis Intervention Service to continue until the end of September . “Correspondence from Extern has been received today requesting additional funding to support the service until the end of March . This is currently being considered. If you feel in crisis and need support oryou have observed someone who is in distress and may come to signicant harm through self-harm and suicidal behaviour please call CCIS on:    If you need to speak to someone urgently, please call Leline on   , the Samaritans or attend your local Emergency Department.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move themselves, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Education Minister Peter Weir yesterday announced a u-turn on results, with all pupils now to be given the higher of the grades submitted by their centre or the grade calculated by CCEA Over a third of all AS and A grades given to students by teachers had been originally downgraded by CCEAs standardisation system last week in a move which drew critcisim from schools, parents and pupils. One County Derry school saw  percent of its results downgraded. Their principal, who wished to remain anonymous, said the system is flawed. googletag.cmd.push “The actual child was taken out of the entire process,” they told the County Derry Post. “Education reports always say, the child is at the centre of all that we do. This system took the child out of the equation and everyone became a number and a statistic. “Nobody sat down and worked out our grades. This is an algorithim or some way of putting all the data into a computer and spewing it back out again.“No heed was paid to teachers professional judgement. the child has been taken out of the equation – and it was a mathematical equation.” The way in which schools previous performance was factored into the process had also caused controversy, with many feeling pupils at comprehensive schools are at a further disadvantage. googletag.cmd.push Having seen a dip in one particular subject the previous year, the affected school poured efforts into rectying the situation, only to see their work negated by the standardisation system. “In one subject this time last year we were devastated [with the results]. If I sat with my arms folded, we would have got the same results this year,” said the Principal. “Those who were sitting looking at our estimated grades and our AS Level grades from the bad situation, dont know what we were doing all year to turn it around. “We were moving mountains to change the situation that CCEA used for that particular subject. “Theyve used the history of subjects. Ours is a high achieving school. One year a child came to us in third year, with no English, and achieved ten A* grades. Does that mean thatthat child had been doing those exams the way they were done this year, they wouldnt have got the ten A* grades, because we had no history of that  “Theyve said, we cant give them four As in Maths, because theyve never had four As in Maths. Does that mean that every year, a child doesnt get the opportunity to get an A  “Specically with our school, they had brought our percentage to  percent. We have never, in the history of A-Levels here, got  percent. So how did they come to that conclusion ” There was criticism also of CCEAs handling of the appeal process and its associated advice. The school only received official advice on the appeals process at .pm on the evening the results came out. “I received guidance on how to write an appeal at .pm. I was at home. We walked out of here yesterday with all our appeals all done and we got that at home” said the Principal. “Nobody can explain why these people have been pulled down. They gave us a webinar on Tuesday before the results came out as a background to how theyve reached the conclusion. “You can have all the webinars you like, butyoure going to disadvantage children, Im going to be shouting, and were not the only school. “We had plenty of good results too, but its the fact that they changed so many pupils. CCEA are saying it was a third that were changed. “If they hadchanged a third of ours, I would not be on the phone to you now, but they have taken  percent of our pupils down. “They were utterly devastated. We have children who looked at a screen last week that said they were unsuccessful in their attempt to get into their university choice. “We spent two full weeks in lockdown sorting out these centre-assessed grades. We might as well not have bothered.” Related: COMMENT: Belated U-turn should have come last week  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Declan Devine has insisted that his players are ready as the clock ticks down towards this evenings Europa League tie with FK Riteriai in Vilnius. The Candystripes boss and his squad left Derry yesterday and flew directly to Lithuania where they have put in place their final preparations for this evening’s game against the Knights, with victory meaning over pound, to the club. City got back to winning ways at the weekend with a deserved - win over Cork City at the Brandywell, a victory which came at the exact right time for Devine and his team who have struggled since football resumed last month. googletag.cmd.push Devine was part of the City management team which flourished on the continent in  against IFK Gothenburg, Gretna and Paris St. Germain and knows full well the joy of winning at the highest level. “Its one of the highlights of your season and something that you reflect back on,” he said. “Some of the European ties Ive been involved in, both with this club and other clubs, have been highlights and memories that live with you for a long time. When you reflect back you want to remember winning thats the ultimate one because you want to progress through a round. googletag.cmd.push “Our recent history, barring Aberystwyth, hasnt been great. Weve qualied which is a sense of achievement, but we have to try and strive to be better we have to get through a round or two and try and make sure its a regular occurrence that we are playing in these types of games.” Devine has dismissed any notion that FK Riteriai are there to be beaten on Tuesday, with the Lithuanians struggling badly in their domestic league. Riteriai have played  league games in A Lyga this season, and won just one game, losing  in the process. Yet Devine believes that their league performance is not a fair reflection of the quality within the team. “This is a tough game,” he said. “Ive watched a lot of them, they are technically very good footballers, but we are going out to try and win a game. We have to be at our very, very best, as everyone has to be in Europe. We cant afford an off night because the stakes are so high. We want to be in this competition for more than  minutes so its all about the performance on the night. “This season has been absolutely nuts. I’ve never seen anything like in in  years in football. Its not something that we really enjoy playing in front of empty stadiums, but its a game of football, its a -minute game that could potentially could go to  minutes and penalties. There are no excuses, we have got to perform on the night and Ive every confidence the boys can do that.”                                                                                    --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There have been some fantastic European adventures at the club over the years and ahead of this season’s Europa League adventure, we look back on some of the biggest nights in Derry City history.  September ,  Derry City , Benfica  The city came to a standstill on Wednesday, September  as Benfica, one of the true European powerhouses, arrived at the Brandywell, with Portugues legend Eusebio in tow. Derry City held their own for an hour but the class of Benfica shone through as they opened the scoring. Benfica substitute Vata got down the wing and crossed and although Vaudequin headed clear, the ball came to Swedish international Jonas Thern, who took a touch before driving the ball across the face of goal and past Tim Dalton into the corner from  yards. googletag.cmd.push Just five minutes later Benfica doubled their lead. Paniera’s corner caused pandemonium in the City penalty area and although Aldair’s shot was blocked, the loose ball came to Ricardo, whose shot beat Dalton, only to be headed off the line by Kevin Brady. The referee’s assistant raised his flag and signalled that the ball had crossed the line and referee Guy Goethals awarded the goal. Derry City were now up against it but on  minutes the Brandywell was brought back to le. Liam Coyle’s through ball sent Felix Healy in behind the Benfica defence and his left-footed shot across goal beat Silvinho, only to bounce back off the base of the post. googletag.cmd.push Fortunately for Derry, the loose ball ran into the path of Paul Carlyle, who kept his composure to drill the ball into the vacant goal from  yards. The fans exploded into le. Derry City were back in the tie. For all their efforts though, McLaughlin’s team could not get the equaliser in the closing stages, but their showing against one of the strongest teams in Europe was not lost on their supporters, who gave them a standing ovation after the game.  August ,  Derry City , Lokomotiv Sofia  Felix Healy’s Derry City side were expected to be second best in their Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Lokomotiv Sofia, the full-timers from Bulgaria. Those fortunate to bag a ticket for the game were to witness a truly historic day at the Brandywell as Derry finally got their first European win as a League of Ireland team. . The only goal of the game came just before half time when Sofia goalkeeper Ruman Apostolev misjudged a cross from Harry McCourt and the ball flicked off the underside of the crossbar before being cleared. However, the linesman signalled that the ball had crossed the line, and much to the dismay of the visitors, the goal was awarded. McCourt’s goal proved to be enough and the final whistle brought memorable scenes at the Brandywell, with a whole generation of City fans seeing their team victorious in European competition for the first time.  August ,  Apoel Nicosia , Derry City  Just two days after facing Barcelona at the Brandywell, the Candy Stripes were in Cyprus for their UEFA Cup tie against Apoel Nicosia and it proved to be a signicant occasion as Derry City finally hit an away goal in a European tie. It had taken almost  years for the Brandywell club to achieve such a feat, with games against Cardf City, Benfica, Vitesse Arnhem, Lokomotiv Sofia and Maribor all drawing a blank. The right man in the right place proved to be none other than Gary Beckett, who scored on the stroke of half time to cancel out Wojciech Kowlczyk’s earlier effort. Nicosia went on to win the game - thanks to Stelios Okkarides’ second half strike, but the crucial away goal meant that Dermot Keely’s side were still in with a chance of progression ahead of the home tie at the Brandywell.  July ,  IFK Gothenburg , Derry City  The great result in the club’s history  Every Derry City fan will be able to say where they were and what they doing when news filtered through from Sweden that the Candy Stripes had beaten IFK Gothenburg on their own patch. For those lucky enough to be in attendance at the Ullevi Stadium, it was scarcely believable and tales of the celebrations which followed the final whistle became as legendary as Sean Hargan’s winning goal. The game was still in the balance until the th minute when Derry ventured forward and won a corner. In a moment never to be forgotten by the small number of Derry City fans in attendance, Kevin Deery floated a corner into the penalty area where Sean Hargan jumped highest to send the ball back across goal and into the net. It was an unstoppable header. With time running out, goalkeeper David Forde produced arguably his two best saves in a Derry City shirt, two world class saves in the space of a minute to keep Gothenburg at bay.  August ,  Gretna , Derry City  Another amazing result, another amazing night for Derry City as  Candystripes packed into Motherwell’s Fir Park to watch a demolition. It all went to plan for Gretna in the opening stages of the game and a nervy start from the Candy Stripes was punished when they fell behind as Ryan McGuffie scored after just eight minutes. Midway through the first half, things started to go wrong for the hosts as Derry City equalised, Darren Kelly meeting the ball with a firm header, sending it into the net to level the tie with a vital away goal. The teams remained level at half time, but Derry City were out again quickly, and in one of the most stunning halves in the club’s history, they blew Gretna away with an incredible display of attacking football. Two brilliant goals from Kevin Deery, including a blistering -yard free kick, put City in control but there was still ore to come. Derry took advantage of a stunned Gretna, Ciaran Martyn scoring two brilliant inidual goals, right in front of the City fans, who were in dreamland.  September ,  Derry City , Paris St. Germain  September  was a huge date in the history of Derry City Football Club as the mighty Paris St. Germain arrived at the Brandywell to great fanfare. The game itself produced another valiant performance from the Candy Stripes, as they showed respect, but no fear, to their glamourous opponents. Twice in the opening stages Killian Brennan came close, shooting just wide before sending a magnicent shot from  yards onto the crossbar. But as the game went on, the French side began to settle and Brennan had to be a hero at the other end as he cleared the ball off the line after Fabrice Pancrate’s header had beaten David Forde. Darren Kelly then cleared the ball off the line a second time as PSG took control and Derry were glad to survive until half time. Perhaps the game’s defining moment came just after the break when Kevin McHugh broke into the PSG penalty area and was brought down. Everyone in red and white screamed for a penalty but Slovakian referee Richard Havrilla said no. It wasn’t to be, but a - draw kept Derry in with a fighting chance ahead of the second leg in Paris.  July ,  Aberystwyth , Derry City  Derry City produced arguably their best performance of the  season, as they hit five in a Europeaan away game for the second time in  years. Leading - from the first leg, City showed no mercy. They cruised into a - lead within  minutes. Headed goals from Michael Duffy and Barry McNamee ended the tie as a contest but City were far from finished. A second half hat trick from Rory Patterson, the third of which was a cheeky penalty dinked down the middle, secured an outstanding - win on the night, and a - victory on aggregate. The score line was also the highest ever recorded for an Irish side in European football history.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Not only does dance allow kids to get their energy out, itrsquos also a great way for children to express themselves. Itrsquos never too early to encourage a love of physical activity in children.Briacuted is passionate about the benefits of dance for young children. ldquoDance is wonderful for coordination. It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy. We incorporate sensory props such as ribbons, scarfs, feathers, bubbles and each dancer brings their own favourite toy to dance with. We introduce the foundations of Irish dance and enjoy watching a potential le long journey of dance begin.Following the Tapping Tots class, some  dancers attended the studio for an Irish dance camp with a dference.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is unfair. “I have raised this with the Minister and asked her to urgently review this decision and to quickly reinstate these test.I have requested a meeting with her so that the instructors can highlight their concerns.”Sinn Féin MLA John O’Dowd called for the opening of temporary driving test facility in Craigavon while the normal center is used for Covid  testing.Mr O’Dowd said: “While I welcome the commencement of Driving Tests across the North I have to express my disappoint they will not be recommencing in Craigavon. I understand the use of the current center for Covid  testing rules out this facility however other facilities could be used to keep tests in the Craigavon area.“I have written to Minister Mallon and asked for other options to be explored and another venue identied to allow learner drivers to complete their tests.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
