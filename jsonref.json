A coroner concluded that Poppi suffocated as she slept next to her father in an \u0027unsafe sleeping environment\u0027 and was probably sexually assaulted by him before she died          Former supermarket worker Worthington (pictured in a court artist sketch at the inquest) has now launched a judicial review of how the death was recorded as he took his case to the High Court, sitting in ManchesterLeslie Thomas QC said it was a \u0027narrow\u0027 point but not \u0027academic\u0027 and Mr Worthington was \u0027entitled\u0027 to have the matter corrected.He argued that the coroner was wrong to include the words \u0027anally penetrated\u0027 in his record of inquest, also called an inquisition, which forms part of the official record, because, according to the law, this should only detail how the child died.As the coroner had ruled that sexual abuse did not cause her death, those words should be taken out of the record of inquest.Mr Thomas said: \u0027We say this is an allegation of criminal conduct stuck in box three. Which should not be there. It doesn\u0027t touch on how this little girl died.\u0027What is on the record and will be kept on the record, and people tend to go to, is the inquisition, is the very end document where the findings are, and that\u0027s incorrect.\u0027          Poppi was found lifeless and bleeding in her father\u0027s double bed in December 2012Pictured: Poppi Worthington\u0027s neighbour who was arrested...Share this articleHe added: \u0027It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death. He has overstepped the mark. In this case, what\u0027s included in box three are matters that did not cause death. Anal penetration is irrelevant to how she died. What\u0027s it doing in box three?\u0027Samantha Leek QC, representing the coroner, said the anal penetration was part of the \u0027wider factual matrix\u0027 giving rise to her death and Mr Thomas was trying to restrict the record of inquest to the immediate medical cause of death.She added: \u0027She came by her death because she is brought into bed, because she\u0027s brought into bed to be harmed.\u0027Where there\u0027s been a high-profile inquest, the central question of which is whether or not this little girl was anally penetrated and whether it caused her death, surely it is within the coroner\u0027s discretion to include that?

No!

But more because the brothers have seemed so close throughout their lives. Until now, that is.    It now seems likely that William and Kate will spend Christmas not only apart from Harry and his pregnant wife Meghan, but many miles awayWith the stream of disclosures threatening to become a torrent, The Mail on Sunday understands courtiers at Kensington Palace have started a ‘mole hunt’ in an attempt to stop leaks to the media that have led to so many unfavourable reports.They have certainly not made for comfortable reading. Insiders have claimed, for example, that a rather ‘dictatorial’ Harry has been throwing his weight around, aggrieved that neither his brother nor courtiers and servants have been ‘rolling out the red carpet’ for his new American bride.It has been suggested that Meghan has been brusque with servants and that her exacting wedding preparations led Kate to burst into tears following a bridesmaid fitting for daughter Charlotte. It has been a stressful time all round, it is true. Kate has only recently given birth to her third child, Louis, while Meghan finds herself a newcomer in a foreign land – and a member of the most extraordinary family in Britain. Perhaps a few early false steps and antagonisms were to be expected.Kid Rock gets booted from his grand marshal gig at Nashville...Carole Middleton says she has stopped reading stories about...Kicking up a stink: \u0027Dictatorial\u0027 bride Meghan wanted air...Furious Duchess of Cambridge \u0027fell out with Meghan Markle...Share this articleMeghan, who has worked hard to master her new Royal brief, is well-liked not just by the public, but by her new father-in-law, Prince Charles. He admires her work ethic and shares an interest in the arts.But the MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested.As early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family. And it was in response that Charles attempted to smooth things over by engineering an invitation to Anmer Hall – William and Kate’s country home near Sandringham. He hoped it might bring the couples together.It didn’t go well. Indeed, one well-placed source says the occasion was marred by a ‘ghastly row’ between the couples – one reason there will be no repeat this Christmas. A senior Royal aide has revealed that the atmosphere at Anmer soured shortly after Harry and his then fiancee had arrived, and Meghan was judged to have been ‘downright rude’.          The MoS understands that as early as last Christmas, well before the May wedding, Meghan was suggesting she didn’t feel entirely welcome with all members of the family‘Kate had a quiet word with Meghan,’ says the aide. ‘It escalated rapidly after Meghan complained to Harry that she had been “told off”.‘He took her side, while William defended Kate, who was five months pregnant with Louis and certainly didn’t want this sort of confrontation.’Kate, it is said, already felt put upon in being asked to host Meghan and Harry. Tired and pregnant, she had been hoping for a quiet Christmas. Perhaps the strain showed.At any rate, the atmosphere was ‘poisonous’ for a while, continues the aide, and only thawed with a visit by Charles, who was told by William what had happened and did his best to jolly everyone along.This is by no means an isolated example of Meghan’s supposed high-handedness, according to chatter in Royal circles.A new book by Royal commentator Robert Jobson even claimed Harry had previously told one staff member: \u0027What Meghan wants, she gets.\u0027The MoS understands that the unease between the Cambridges and the Sussexes is more long-standing and has been deeper than has so far been suggested (pictured: Meghan and Kate at the wedding of Princess Eugenie)This newspaper has learned from one of William’s closest friends that the Prince had doubts about how suitable Meghan might be as his brother’s bride – and that he voiced them.It is understood William’s concerns reached the ears of the Queen and, more pertinently, of Harry himself. One member of William’s circle told the MoS: ‘The problem is that the Cambridges felt things had moved very quickly between Harry and Meghan. Wills particularly was worried and felt close enough to Harry to voice his thoughts.’The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brother. But few of us like it when our romantic choice is questioned – and this appears to be the case with Harry now.Royal observers are asking, too, if William fears that Meghan is in some way assuming the space occupied by his late mother Diana. A beautiful, fashion-loving Royal determined to make her mark through charitable works? The parallels are inevitable.          The two boys were brought especially close by the death of their mother, and William has always kept an eye out for his younger brotherKate, in contrast, has taken a less showy approach to her role. She has dutifully accepted advice on how to dress and how to deport herself as a Royal, whereas Meghan has so far seemed determined to strike out on her own – on occasion at least.It is understood that Kate has had a number of meetings over tea in which she has attempted to explain the rules of The Firm to Meghan – and that her advice didn’t go down well. Kate is said to have told friends she was very sad about what was happening and felt that Harry was ‘changing’.‘She and Harry have always had a very close relationship, but she said things were different,’ says one. But if William’s wife has become adept at fading into the background, that does not make her soft.On the contrary. ‘Meghan’s a strong character and so is Kate, so it doesn’t surprise me there have been clashes,’ said the source.Indeed, some are calling her a Steel Marshmallow, a phrase first applied to William and Harry’s great-grandmother, the late Queen Mother.With the days that William, Kate and Harry went around together as a dynamic team now decisively over, they are leading lives that are not only increasingly separate, but very different.Harry and Meghan spent a considerable part of the summer in their rented house in Oxfordshire where they entertained friends including George and Amal Clooney, and tennis star Serena Williams. Theirs is a markedly more celebrity-driven ‘court’ than has been normal for the Royals in recent times, and quite different from the so-called Turnip Toffs who make up William and Kate’s group of friends in Norfolk.And with the celebrity associates, it seems, come celebrity anxieties.So uncomfortable have they grown with a steady stream of media disclosures, it seems that Harry and Meghan are now determined to bring them to a halt.It will be fascinating to see just what or who the Royal ‘mole-hunt’ unearths."},{"url":null,"title":"Apprentice fans clock Sir Alan Sugar wearing SEVEN different Rolexes nine episodes","story":"    Sir Alan Sugar wore a silver Rolex Daytona worth £20,000 on episode one of series 14 of The Apprentice          On episode two, the business tycoon flashed a silver and black Sky-dweller Rolex worth £20,000He also donned an 18 carat yellow gold Yacht-Master II worth £30,000 in episode five where Rick Monk was booted from the show after contestants created their own footwear brand.In one episode Lord Sugar flashed a watch, originally designed for Pan American Airways pilots, worth an impressive £90,000. The Apprentice EXCLUSIVE: Tom admits he felt \u0027relaxed\u0027 going...\u0027A load of Jackson Pollocks!\u0027 Lord Sugar\u0027s barb about the...Share this articleAnd the seven Rolexes worn throughout the latest series are estimated to have cost Lord Sugar around £230,000.Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to point out the tycoon\u0027s varied collection of expensive wrist wear throughout the series.

They think of other people.\u0027\u0027Bush understands that politics is politics and friendship is friendship,\u0027 an agent who was on his detail says. \u0027He can be friends with a lot of people who may not agree with him. The only things that bothered him were things that were important to the country. Little things just kind of seemed to roll off of him.\u0027When Bush—code-named Timberwolf—was vice president, agent William Albracht was on the midnight shift at the vice president\u0027s residence. While agents refer to the President\u0027s Protective Detail as the Show, they call the Vice President\u0027s Protective Detail the Little Show with Free Parking. That\u0027s because, unlike the White House, the vice president\u0027s residence provides parking for agents.Albracht was new to the post, and Agent Dowling filled him in.\u0027Well, Bill, every day the stewards bake the cookies, and that is their job, and that is their responsibility,\u0027 Dowling told him. \u0027And then our responsibility on midnights is to find those cookies or those left from the previous day and eat as many of them as possible.\u0027Assigned to the basement post around 3 a.m., Albracht was getting hungry.\u0027We never had permission to take food from the kitchen, but sometimes you get very hungry on midnights,\u0027 said Albracht.  \u0027I walked into the kitchen that was located in the basement and opened up the refrigerator. I\u0027m hoping that there are some leftover snacks from that day\u0027s reception, It was slim pickin\u0027s. All of a sudden, there\u0027s a voice over my shoulder.\u0027  George W.

And I said, Well, sir, every day the stewards bake cookies, but every night they hide them from us.\u0027With a wink of his eye he says, Let\u0027s find \u0027em. So we tore the kitchen apart, and sure enough we did find them. He took a stack of chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk and went back up to bed, and I took a stack and a glass of milk and went back to the basement post.\u0027When Albracht returned to the post, Dowling asked, \u0027Who the hell were you in there talking to?\u0027Albracht told him what had happened. \u0027Oh yeah, sure right,\u0027 Dowling said.Agents noted the contrast between George H. W. Bush and Al Gore, one of Bush\u0027s successors as vice president. Like Hillary Clinton, Gore - who also claimed to be a champion of the \u0027little people\u0027-treated agents with disdain and told them he did not want to be bothered greeting them or seeing them.\u0027Gore told agents at his home in Carthage, Tennessee, that they should duck behind bushes when they rotated shifts because the Gores didn\u0027t want to see them,\u0027 a former agent says. \u0027I was on the detail one Christmas when Gore was at his home in Carthage,\u0027 former agent Jeff Crane says. \u0027Neighbors offered us food on Christmas Day, but the Gores never even bothered to say \u0027Merry Christmas\u0027 or \u0027Thank you.\u0027Hillary Clinton, who continues to be protected by the Secret Service as the spouse of a former president, is so nasty to her agents that being assigned to her detail is considered by agents to be a form of punishment and the worst duty assignment in the Secret Service.Like Bush, President Trump treats his agents with respect and consideration. Sitting on a sofa overlooking the main Mar-a-Lago pool four days before a recent New Year\u0027s Eve party there, I asked Trump how he likes being protected by Secret Service agents.

He was to have dinner at the Chart House seafood restaurant on North Garden Street, on the banks of the Boise River.\u0027The way we protected him, we had some agents inside, but typically what we\u0027d do was situate ourselves at dining tables near him,\u0027 Dowling says.Dowling had been seated for a few minutes when he heard a radio transmission: Two white males in camouflage outfits and carrying long weapons were creeping around the back toward their location. They were crawling on their bellies, moving themselves along with their elbows.Just then, Dowling looked up and saw the two bad guys. He thought of intelligence reports that Libya had sent a hit squad to the U.S. to kill American officials. The agent instinctively jumped out of his chair and tackled Bush to protect him. Food flew everywhere as Dowling threw the vice president on the ground and flopped on top of him.\u0027What\u0027s going on here?\u0027 Bush demanded to know.\u0027I don\u0027t know, but just keep your head down,\u0027 Dowling answered.Dowling looked up. He saw dozens of law enforcement officers with their guns drawn—Secret Service agents, sheriff\u0027s department deputies, and state troopers. They were on the scene as part of routine protection for a vice presidential visit. The two bad guys were kneeling with their hands clasped behind their heads.\u0027We evacuated the VP out of the restaurant to get him away from whatever danger may have still been there,\u0027 Dowling says. \u0027You would think I had just thwarted an assassination attempt.\u0027As it turned out, the restaurant was near an apartment complex where the girlfriend of one of the two men lived.\u0027The guy had gone to see his girlfriend, and she was there with another guy,\u0027 Dowling said.          Former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal journalist Len Kessler with President Trump. at Mar-a-Lago. Kessler says the president treats his agents with respect and consideration\u0027So the boyfriend got very angry. The other guy who was there with his girlfriend pulled out a knife, kind of slashed him, didn\u0027t hurt him badly. So this fellow who had been cut decided that he and another guy were going to go back and kill the guy that night.\u0027Not knowing the vice president was coming, they parked in the lot at the Chart House and decided to sneak through the woods to get to the apartment complex. They were tried and convicted on illegal weapons and attempted assault charges.Despite warnings from his detail, Bush would insist on leaving the Oval Office through the door to the Rose Garden and greeting tourists lined up along the fence on Pennsylvania Avenue. Bush\u0027s detail leader assigned agents to rush to the fence as soon as an alarm notified them that Bush had opened the door to the outside. Soon, the Washington Post ran a story reporting that tourists were delighted at their unexpected encounter with the president. Trump warns Democrats he\u0027ll \u0027close the entire Southern...George H.W.

From then on, \u0027Bush would give us time to set up a secure zone at the fence,\u0027 Smith says.At one point, Bush and his wife Barbara were staying at their Kennebunkport home in the winter, and the president and his wife went out for a walk in the freezing cold.\u0027I had a hat on, and two of the other agents had a hat on, but the one agent assigned to the first lady didn\u0027t bring a hat with him,\u0027 says former agent Patrick F.

A coroner concluded that Poppi suffocated as she slept next to her father in an \u0027unsafe sleeping environment\u0027 and was probably sexually assaulted by him before she died          Former supermarket worker Worthington (pictured in a court artist sketch at the inquest) has now launched a judicial review of how the death was recorded as he took his case to the High Court, sitting in ManchesterLeslie Thomas QC said it was a \u0027narrow\u0027 point but not \u0027academic\u0027 and Mr Worthington was \u0027entitled\u0027 to have the matter corrected.He argued that the coroner was wrong to include the words \u0027anally penetrated\u0027 in his record of inquest, also called an inquisition, which forms part of the official record, because, according to the law, this should only detail how the child died.As the coroner had ruled that sexual abuse did not cause her death, those words should be taken out of the record of inquest.Mr Thomas said: \u0027We say this is an allegation of criminal conduct stuck in box three. Which should not be there. It doesn\u0027t touch on how this little girl died.\u0027What is on the record and will be kept on the record, and people tend to go to, is the inquisition, is the very end document where the findings are, and that\u0027s incorrect.\u0027          Poppi was found lifeless and bleeding in her father\u0027s double bed in December 2012Pictured: Poppi Worthington\u0027s neighbour who was arrested...Share this articleHe added: \u0027It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death.

So we invited her into the office to see the paper get made – and have it out with the editorsLubaina Himid unpacks a carefully wrapped parcel and extracts a yellowing front page of the old broadsheet  from 1983. It features a portrait of the Zimbabwean politician Joshua Nkomo, looking “fat and dishevelled”. She has no particular beef with that, as she explains to a group of journalists, many of whom were not yet born when the picture appeared – “he was the enemy at that point”. But shockingly, it was the only picture of a non-white person that she found in the paper that year.It was not for want of searching: she was working on her MA at the time and part of her mission was to investigate what young black artists like herself were looking at. In 2007 – the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the British empire – she began to take a more systematic approach, cutting out every image of a black person she could find in the paper over a period of years. Some she painted over, emphasising patterns and “restoring the dignity” of their subjects, in an extended critique which would culminate last year in the show that won her the Turner prize.Today’s  is very different to that of the early 1980s, with the sports pages in particular brimming with triumphant black athletes. Is she happier now? Is she hell – though she concedes that the problem has changed over the years, from absence to varieties of presence. On the morning after her Turner win, she laid into “this extraordinary habit of placing negative text, about something else entirely, next to images of black people … juxtapositions that are always to do with either violence, prisons or theft.”To many of the people working with those texts and images, her reading seemed baffling. So we invited her in to the  for a three-day residency that would bring her face to face with the staff responsible for producing a newspaper which, she emphasises, is not merely her favourite but the only one she cares about. The resulting artwork – based on 15 pages published during the week of her residency – has just gone on show at Liverpool Central Library.If Himid’s mission was to find out how the print edition came out looking as it did, the ’s was to investigate how her opinions, as a newspaper traditionalist, might change when confronted with the realities of a global news operation reporting 24 hours a day on stories from all over the world, only a fraction of which make it into her beloved paper.It didn’t begin well. Himid reported for her first day clutching a copy of the previous Saturday’s Weekend magazine and fulminating: “I can’t believe you gave me this. Now of all times.” The problem was a front-page picture illustrating an issue themed around “the impossible body”. It featured a black male dancer contorted into a shape so extreme that he appears, literally, to have lost his head. Pictures that involve the cropping of faces turn out to be one of her pet hates: another was of Tiger Woods disembarking from a jet in Paris for September’s Ryder Cup, his head clipped into a flat-top at the upper edge of the frame.Other stories to emerge from her “random selection from a random week” included the sentencing of the American entertainer Bill Cosby for aggravated sexual assault, and the latest episode in the soap opera of Manchester United footballer Paul Pogba. “He’s just a young man. He hasn’t raped and abused like Cosby, so why have you got the word ‘punished’ on the back page?”.The coincidence of Cosby and Pogba bookending a single edition of the paper – one on the front page and one on the back – highlighted her central question: were such collisions the result of accident or design? It took the combined insistence of the news and sports desks to convince her that this particular combination was the product of separate departments working to their own time pressures in different parts of the office.One of the revelations for Himid was how big the  is. “I had this image of you sitting in a room with your big braces and your cigars and your whiskies just putting the whole thing together, but actually it’s more like a call centre,” she said. She was also surprised – “though I shouldn’t be” – by the pace at which it is created. “What I hadn’t got my head around was that you were producing it faster than I was reading it,” she said. “Sometimes I read Saturday’s paper on Wednesday, so I’m working at a different pace to you. As journalists, you are on to the next thing, but as a reader I am not.”Living in Preston, in the north of England, she was also unfamiliar with edition changes which, over the course of a night, can transform a snatched news picture into something more considered. The CosbyPogba paper was a case in point: the first edition – which goes to press at 9pm UK time – featured on the front page a snap of Cosby being led away in handcuffs, while the back page showed Pogba and his teammates killing time on the bench before a big match. The final, more polished edition, sent to press at 1am, replaced those with a police mugshot of Cosby and an action shot from the match, which by then had taken place.The earlier images, she says, seemed “stolen” – another of her bugbears, in that snatched pictures take the power away from their subjects. That’s because they were indeed snatched, conceded the ’s head of photography, Fiona Shields, who pointed out that placeholder pictures were often necessary for early takes on late-breaking stories. In the case of Cosby, as with all American stories, the challenge was exacerbated by the time difference between the US and the UK.So what of that “impossible body” photograph from Weekend magazine, which carried the cover line: “How we control, improve and future-proof what nature gave us”? The supplement’s editor, Melissa Denes, explained that the intention had been to cast a performer who could do something extraordinary – “visually almost impossible” – with their body, working with Royal Opera House ballet dancer Jordan Ajadi. “A cover of a sexualised white woman might have been the more common approach for an issue on the body, but the magazine also aims to cast people of colour wherever possible.”Questions of power and control recurred on the sports pages, with head of sport Will Woodward making a strong case for the picture of the jetsetting Woods. “This is the story of a sportsman who has made a triumphant comeback from the apparent collapse of his career,” he said. “I think it makes him look very cool.” Himid’s artistic response, in her overpainted version, was to restore the golfer’s head to its natural shape.In her debrief with  staff at the end of the project it was pointed out that there was an irony in so much criticism being centred on a section which features such a high proportion of successful black sportspeople. It was the section in which image and word most often collided, with “Europe can tame Tiger” among the headlines she singled out as problematic, because of its animal imagery (she has previously objected to the use of “Venomous Venus”).The sports team pointed out that alliteration was one of the tools at their disposal to reflect the dynamism of competitive sport, as were pugilistic verbs – “kill”, “slaughter”, “slay” – which Himid also disliked. “I wonder whether some of the time you’re really saying we shouldn’t have commissioned that piece,” said Woodward – to which Himid responded, “I mostly think the articles are totally brilliant. There are so many layers and levels to what’s going on, but sometimes the surface lets that down.”As she laid out her finished work, the most intractable issue appeared to be the juxtaposition of editorial content with advertising. Himid was astonished to discover that late deadlines and separate digital planners mean the editor of Weekend does not routinely see, or sign off on, advertising in the magazine. An inside image of Ajadi was offset by a prominent full page advertisement for an insurance firm themed on “3,475 shades of white to argue over”. This was one problem that should soon be reduced, hoped Denes, by a new system to amalgamate planning systems for editorial and advertising.While accepting that she is an unusual reader, in that her perspective is entirely visual, Himid argues that her interpretation is available to anyone. “If you are sitting reading a magazine on a train, the person opposite you will be seeing both the front and back cover. These images are there, the juxtapositions are there, whether you intended them or not.”Her aim, she said, was simply to start a conversation. “It was a random selection of a random week and it really is just seeing what you did there. I know there are some incredible articles because I read them from beginning to end, as the rest of my family do every day.”While her Turner submission was entitled Negative Positives, the new one is called Random Coincidence – “because you all keep telling me that it’s a coincidence. It’s random. And I absolutely believe that is what you believe,” she says. “But please make a tiny bit of time in your day when you’re trying to push it out to consider how it’s going to look coming in.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efeb78bb08c45d76acd5ca2d6629934e93b93bd4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93f279f342c57eda550c767a0890d887","title":"best books of 2018 hilary mantel yuval noah harari and more pick their favourites","story":"Our favourite authors on the most outstanding books they read this yearby  Jonathan Franzen,  Hilary Mantel,  Yuval Noah Harari,  Olivia Laing,  Nicola Sturgeon,  Chris Ware and moreAgainst all reason and cultural prognostication, people keep writing terrific novels. Three that stood out for me this year were John Wray’s Godsend (published in the UK by Canongate in January), Kate Greathead’s Laura \u0026amp Emma (Simon \u0026amp Schuster), and Donal Ryan’s From a Low and Quiet Sea (Doubleday). Godsend ridiculously posits that a teenage girl from Santa Rosa, California, might disguise herself as a boy and attempt to join the Taliban. It’s a book that has no right to work at all, but Wray’s storytelling is so taut, his prose so laser-etched, his psychology so audacious, and his wisdom so much the opposite of conventional, that it ends up working brilliantly. Greathead, too, in Laura \u0026amp Emma has set herself a mighty challenge: to create sympathy for a disgustingly privileged Wasp family in New York. It’s a tough sell, and she makes it with masterly deftness, funny sentence by funny sentence. By the end, what seems to have been a casually episodic narrative reveals itself to be a moving and intricately braided story of two mothers. From a Low and Quiet Sea is similarly late-detonating. It tells the stories of three utterly disparate characters – a Syrian refugee, a feckless young Irish bus driver and a master of Irish graft – and proceeds to confound those of us who don’t like it when novelists withhold pertinent information. The book has stayed with me. All three of these books have stayed with me. I’m starting to wonder if we’re living in a literary golden age.What could I choose, but Diarmaid MacCulloch’s masterly Thomas Cromwell: A Life (Allen Lane)? For those less Tudor, An American Princess by Annejet van der Zijl (Amazon Crossing, translated by Michele Hutchison) is the story of Allene Tew, a small-town banker’s daughter five times wed, to gamblers, stockbrokers and finally royals. Light and gracefully written, it dances through a century of history, costing out the American dream like a feminine complement to the National Theatre’s absorbing Lehman Trilogy.Michael Pollan’s How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics (Allen Lane) changed my mind, or at least some of the ideas held in my mind. Pollan takes a fresh look at the controversial history of psychedelic drugs, highlighting their positive potential without hiding their dangerous side. It is all too easy for a spiritual quest for truth to mutate into a consumerist pursuit of excitement. Whatever one may think of psychedelics, the book reminds us that the mind is the greatest mystery in the universe, that this mystery is always right here, and that we usually dedicate far too little time and energy to exploring it. AI Superpowers by Kai-Fu Lee (Houghton Mifflin) is a superb and very timely survey of the impact of AI on the geopolitical system, the job market and human society. Unlike most books of its kind, it is written from the perspective of China rather than Silicon Valley. It raises important concerns about the cataclysmic disruptions AI might cause, and avoids the naive techno-utopianism that reigns on both sides of the Pacific. If the AI superpowers enter an escalating arms race, whoever wins, humanity will be the loser. In Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress (Penguin), Steven Pinker extols the amazing achievements of modernity, and demonstrates that humankind has never been so peaceful, healthy and prosperous. It is the most optimistic book I’ve read in a long time. There is, of course, much to disagree with and to argue about, but that’s what makes this book so interesting.Normally I’d steer clear of recommending prize winners, but this year’s Man Booker winner Milkman by Anna Burns (Faber) is outstanding and without a doubt my favourite book of the year. It’s the story of a young woman growing up in 1970s Belfast (though the city, like most of the characters, is not named), struggling to cope with the unwanted sexual attention of a paramilitary. It is an immersive and unsettling read that rewards perseverance through the first few pages, as the narrator’s voice establishes itself in the reader’s mind. In non-fiction, Doris Kearns Goodwin’s Leadership (Viking) is an excellent portrait of the leadership traits, particularly through times of national challenge, of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, Teddy and Franklin D Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. Again, a timely and rewarding read.This year, I loved Bitter by Francesca Jakobi (W\u0026ampN), an incredibly moving novel about a mother’s guilt and shame at her inability to bond with her son. It is a beautifully woven tale that tilts with issues of class and race and religion. The reader’s feelings towards the protagonist always balance somewhere between pity and indignation, never drifting towards any simplistic sense of certainty. In the vein of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, The Incurable Romantic (Little, Brown) is a compilation of the real-life case studies of a clinical psychologist, but here focused on the tenebrous world of obsessive love. There is a danger that this kind of book can come across as dry and unengaging, but Frank Tallis draws his characters with such wit and skill that at times it reminded me of novels such as The Collector or Enduring Love.Judging the Man Booker prize brought many delightful surprises this year. Apart from those, I’d recommend Stuart Turton’s The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle to anyone who loves complexity and conundrums Elly Griffiths’ The Stranger Diaries (Quercus) for lovers of gothic suspense, tempered with one of the most engaging detectives I’ve encountered in a long time and Lou Berney’s November Road (HarperCollins), which shows that the Kennedy assassination remains fertile ground – conspiracy theory meets a bittersweet love story.Skin Deep by Liz Nugent (Penguin) is a twisted thriller, reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith. A scarred woman brings chaos to those around her, but Nemesis is coming. Kill ’Em All by John Niven (W\u0026ampH) is like Martin Amis’s Money retooled for the age of Trump a gleefully vicious and vulgar satire on the music industry, fame and greed. Robin Robertson’s The Long Take (Picador) is a 200-page narrative poem about a second world war veteran seeking a living in LA and trying not to succumb to PTSD. Beautifully realised and filled with memorable imagery and phrasing to die for.The two children’s books I loved most this year are also two of the children’s books I’ve loved most this decade. One is The Murderer’s Ape, by Jakob Wegelius (Pushkin), out this year in paperback – a fast-paced adventure story told from the point of view of a brilliantly clever and impeccably polite ape, Sally Jones. The other, Hilary McKay’s The Skylarks’ War (Macmillan), is a rare thing: a story that traverses a decade in 300 pages, a book about the first world war that feels utterly fresh, and a portrait of kindness and courage that never dips into sentimentality. McKay is always a joy and this is her best book yet, I think.Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina (Granta) is not only a step forward for comic strip literary fiction, but a book that shows, as well as tells, the slippery horrors of our post-truth reality. In Olivier Schrauwen’s mind-inverting masterpiece Parallel Lives (Fantagraphics), the cartoonist’s alien abduction branches into a series of funny and frightening psychosexual ruminations on the nature of relationships that feel as fresh and strange as human life actually is. Manga pioneer Tadao Tsuge’s awkward, unsentimental and sometimes Chekhovian short comics from the 1960s and 70s delineate the violent, desperate wanderers of postwar Tokyo’s red-light districts. In Slum Wolf (New York Review Comics), translator Ryan Holmberg, one of the world’s finest comics writers, smoothes out the folds and expertly sets the historical scene so that readers (and graphic novelists like me) find they still have a whole lot to learn.Suzanne Batty’s States of Happiness (Bloodaxe) is an extraordinary collection that explores mental anguish. It begins with a complex sequence of poems in memory of her twin sister, who died of a rare degenerative disease. Though the book is dark and disturbing, it is also filled with chinks of light. The poems are as compelling as any thriller and full of insight and empathy. Nadine Aisha Jassat’s Let Me Tell You This (404 Ink) is a punchy, powerful debut collection that investigates what it means to be of dual heritage. The poems capture with real panache the secret lives of women, and they’re poignant, too. Pretend You Don’t Know Me (Bloodaxe), by South African Finula Dowling, is a witty and wise collection of new and selected poems. Her sequence about her mother’s dementia is very touching. Elsewhere, these vital works will have you crying with laughter.Bluntly cutting through much condescending nonsense written about millennials, Malcolm Harris’s Kids These Days (Little, Brown) describes how many of their private neuroses are socially constructed – strategies of survival in the bleak world they have inherited from their elders. The monographs of Byung Chul-Han, including What Is Power? and The Expulsion of the Other (Polity), can be read as companion pieces to Harris’s book. Whether analysing the smartphone or the notion of beauty on Instagram, this Korean-born German philosopher always has astute things to say about the many seductive forms of coercion and conformity today. Maria Tumarkin’s shape-shifting Axiomatic (Brow) deploys all the resources of narrative, reportage and essay. It is a work of great power and beauty. With mainstream journalism investing most of its analytical energy in the foggy concept of populism, the most illuminating historical and sociological explanations of our age of crisis have come from small magazines and university presses. Kathleen Belew’s superbly comprehensive Bring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America (Harvard) – which argues that a white power movement emerged as a reaction to the Vietnam war – supplants all journalistic accounts of America’s resurgent white supremacism. Few writers of fiction have chronicled American power and its psychic costs as steadily and briskly over the decades as Deborah Eisenberg. Your Duck Is My Duck (Ecco), her first collection of stories in 12 years, describes with eerie prescience many circles of America’s current moronic inferno.I gave up Twitter this year, with two immediate consequences: I started dreaming again and recovered a ferocious appetite for reading. Evenings, it turns out, are long. Like everyone, I loved Sally Rooney’s beautifully observed Normal People (Faber). I also finally read Eve Babitz’s Slow Days, Fast Company, first published in the 1970s but recently reissued by New York Review Books. It is funny, sexy and then suddenly brutal, like a shark attack at the beach. As for poetry, I fell hard for Amy Key’s Isn’t Forever (Bloodaxe), a gorgeous, sad box of delights about intimacy, bad bodies, sorrow. Like Babitz, Key is adept at linguistic surprises, charting women’s lives with a savage delicacy. But my favourite book, and you’d better be quick, is Blueprint, a tiny edition of photographs by the New York artist Mary Manning (JMS). Manning is truly a genius at unregarded, everyday beauty. Everything on the planet has been Instagrammed by now, and yet her casual, seemingly unstudied photos have the capacity to make the familiar world look absolutely new.Written in 1962 and reprinted again this year, every word, every sentence, every full-stop of Cassandra at the Wedding (Daunt) by Dorothy Baker had me in its clutches. I love books about small moments stretched out so wide you can observe the nuances and air bubbles that usually go unnoticed. Baker’s writing is immediate, strong and modern. She plumbs the deep emotional truth of human beings. Such sweet agony. The Secret Lives of Colour (John Murray) by Kassia St Clair is beautifully presented with the edges of the pages tinted different hues. The book is simply about colour. But colour is not simple. The history, geography, politics, scandals and influence of colours and shades are documented here with a lively and knowledgeable voice. With references from Jessica Rabbit to Lord Mountbatten, from Greek poets to slavery, this is a fascinating read. You can dip into specific colours or read it straight through like I did.An Anarchy of Chillies by Caz Hildebrand (Thames \u0026amp Hudson) is bold and bright, each variety given its own unique design, represented with brilliant illustrations. It’s a must for anyone who’s serious about their chillies, their graphic design, or both. Lateral Cooking by Niki Segnit (Bloomsbury) is all about confidence: confidence in skill, flavours and technique. Knowledgeable and humorous, with a focus on flavour and technique, this cookbook is informative, useful and sure to become a kitchen bible to many. Gill Meller’s latest cookbook Time (Quadrille) is poetic and romantic – a string of beautiful recipes guide you through the seasons. Fig and seville marmalade buns are perfect for a warming winter breakfast while fried mackerel with tomatoes, garlic and herbs are quintessential summer.I’ve been giving thanks all year for the crucial act of contextualisation in Sarah Churchwell’s Behold, America (Bloomsbury), which reveals language, history and consequence as all joined at the hip and for Lyndsey Stonebridge’s Placeless People (Oxford), a stunning study as much of literature’s own “endurance beyond the nation, and its worldly capacity to conjure up human community out of despair” as of migrant refuge and the powerplay of state refusal of refuge, via the 20th century’s great writers of displacement. Also, a book of essays by Alexander Nemerov, Summoning Pearl Harbor (David Zwirner) works like poetry on history, nationality, memory and aesthetic form and in a unifying and liberating meditation opens all their closures. In fiction I was taken with Helen McClory’s On the Edges of Vision (404 Ink). Her edgy stories transmit the strangeness of realities in a way that’s comforting precisely because so unsettling. She’s a writer completely unafraid. I was also left amazed, again, at the blitheness, the nonchalant courage, with which Kate Atkinson – whose new novel Transcription (Transworld) is another formal high-wire act – regularly renews, as if it’s second nature, the possibilities of the novel form.Richard Powers’s The Overstory (Heinemann) is among the best novels I’ve read this decade. I would describe it as a towering redwood were it not so committed to a model of complex and reciprocal relations between humans and the more-than-human world. Better thought of as a teeming ecosystem or biome of a novel, then, which enacts in its structures a version of the symbiosis it advances as an ethic. Beyond its experiment in form, it is dazzlingly written at the levels of the sentence and the sequence (the book’s understorey). Powers is as brilliant on trees and arborescence as he has been in past novels on music, AI and neuroscience. The novel arrives at a time when deforestation in the name of “growth” has become a flashpoint for protest politics in Sheffield, Germany (Hambach), India (Delhi) and dozens of other countries despite its deep-time perspective, it could hardly be more of-the-moment. Daegan Miller’s This Radical Land: A Natural History of American Dissent (Chicago) stands as analytical counterpart to Powers’s novel: a fascinating, often hopeful journey through the landscape histories of “vibrant resistance” – anarchism, anti-slavery movements, social-justice activists – that have sprung up across North America over the last two centuries. Rebecca Solnit’s Call Them By Their True Names (Granta) is another vibrantly resisting work, that calls out euphemism (“climate change” should be “climate violence”) and celebrates good naming where it is practised. Lastly, like many readers I was gripped by Guy Gunaratne’s remarkable debut novel, In Our Mad and Furious City (Tinder), with its complex cast of lonely Londoners and its brave, poetic polyphony of voices.Make Ink: A Forager’s Guide to Natural Inkmaking (Abrams) by Jason Logan is a remarkable book on the alchemy of inkmaking – yes, making your own inks – that combines science, art, craft and foraging. You will never again look at rust, soot, peach stones, or fag ends in the same way. As President Obama’s photographer, Pete Souza was one of the very finest official White House snappers. In his provocative Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents (Sphere), he contrasts pictures of the 44th incumbent with vignettes from the administration of the 45th to caustic effect. Mark Dery’s Born to Be Posthumous: The Eccentric Life and Mysterious Genius of Edward Gorey (William Collins) is a detailed, devoted and highly readable biography of the illustrator who – from The Doubtful Guest to The Curious Sofa – defined and embodied a world of camp, gothic hilarity.One of my favourite books this year was Robin Robertson’s The Long Take (Picador). Crossing genre boundaries, it is a moving, melancholic and strangely inspiring poem that tells the story of a D-Day veteran as he travels across three big cities in the US. He is a broken flâneur, a man stuck between worlds, and this is a book about the invisible wounds we carry with us everywhere about not being able to go home, yet still finding the courage, or the animal instinct, to carry on. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber), the last in her trilogy, stayed with me long after I had finished it. Composed of a series of conversations, it is captivating and incredibly well written. Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador) is simply mesmerising, not only in the way in which it enters the mind of an iconic woman, Kathy Acker, but also for its originality, inventiveness and chutzpah. And Richard Holloway’s Waiting for the Last Bus (Canongate) is a real gem: a tender book, brimming with wisdom, beauty and compassion. Reading Holloway is like taking a long walk in the countryside – afterwards, you understand the world better, you feel less lonely.Henry Hardy has self-effacingly devoted the larger part of his professional career to the editing, promoting and celebrating of the work of Isaiah Berlin. In Search of Isaiah Berlin: A Literary Adventure (IB Tauris) looks back over his long labours of love with fondness, a fine dry wit and a light salting of justified irritation at those entrusted with Berlin’s posthumous affairs. The second part consists of Hardy’s own philosophical response to Berlin’s theories on matters such as plurality, religious belief and our shared human nature. A wonderful book on a wonderful subject. It would surely take the staunchest of bird fanciers to stand up for the poor old seagull – or plain gull, as it has become, since it took to the dumps – but that is what Tim Dee does, and does persuasively, in his fascinating, funny and bravely titled Landfill (Little Toller). To say his book is about gulls would be like saying that Lolita is about paedophilia. Sue Prideaux’s ill-advisedly titled I Am Dynamite! (Faber) is the biography Friedrich Nietzsche has been crying out for since the day he lost his reason and embraced a horse in a Turin square in 1889. Prideaux brings a calm and steady light to bear on this most incandescent of philosopher-poets, with illuminating results. Her book is a disgracefully entertaining read into the bargain.A novel that really got under my skin this year was Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation (Cape), a work of delinquent brilliance about a bereaved young woman who, with the help of a quack GP and an array of cures for the condition of consciousness, spends an entire year in hibernation in her New York apartment. It’s relentlessly dark, frequently very funny, and establishes Moshfegh as a uniquely gifted diagnostician of contemporary absurdity. And then there was Sally Rooney’s Normal People (Faber), which, like everyone else who read it, I consumed at reckless speed and with rare pleasure. Rooney has a mysterious ability to pull the reader in – gently, casually, inexorably – to her world on the very first page. She writes with a distinctive combination of lightness and absolute seriousness of purpose. I can’t remember the last time I got so personally invested in the lives of invented people. (Actually, I remember exactly when it was: it was last year, with Rooney’s previous book, Conversations with Friends.) In non-fiction, the book that has burrowed most deeply into the recesses of my brain was New Dark Age (Verso) by the artist and critic James Bridle. The more sophisticated technology has become, Bridle argues, and the more our lives are saturated with information, the less capable we are of understanding our world. It’s unsettling people have taken me to task for encouraging them to read it and causing them to lose actual sleep. But for all its bleakness, it has illuminated the present for me like no other recent book I’ve read.• This article was corrected on 3 December 2018.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week:Let’s start with a burst of genius. James Joyce’s Ulysses has impressed originalabsence:Rereading Ulysses, surely the very pinnacle of literature in English. Take this:“Galleys of the Lochlanns ran here to beach, in quest of prey, their bloodbeaked prows riding low on a molten pewter surf. Dane vikings, torcs of tomahawks aglitter on their breasts when Malachi wore the collar of gold. A school of turlehide whales stranded in hot noon, spouting, hobbling in the shallows. Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs, my people, with flayers’ knives, running, scaling, hacking in green blubbery whalemeat. Famine, plague and slaughters. Their blood is in me, their lusts my waves. I moved among them on the frozen Liffey, that I, a changeling, among the spluttering resin fires. I spoke to no-one: none to me.”Talking of strange talent, Richard Brautigan’s The Hawkline Monster has delighted Tom Mooney:Yes, more Brautigan! More glorious Brautigan!This is another gem from the deadpan comic genius himself. I just can’t get enough at the moment. Every book feels like a little treat, just for me. This is his ‘gothic western’, a crazy tale which starts out like the Sisters Brothers, passes through Shirley Jackson, hangs around with Scooby Doo and in the end is something all its own.Read Edward Carey’s Little, based on the life of Madame Tussaud. I won’t say too much as it might come out of the bag as the Reading Group recommendation. It’s brilliant. One of the best books I’ve read this year.As it happens, it didn’t get selected. But don’t let that put you off – as paulburns continues:Even if it doesn’t get selected for the Reading Group, rush out and buy it or borrow it from the library. You won’t regret it.A Feast Of Snakes by Harry Crews has left safereturndoubtful marvelling:In the small town of Mystic in Georgia the bored locals are preparing for their one claim to fame, the annual Rattlesnake Roundup. However those locals include washed up football players, sexually frustrated former cheerleaders, racists, rapists, and trainers of vicious fighting dogs. There is certainly plenty of the grotesque, bizarre and menace in Crews’s honest examination of dark side of humanity.Despite its horrors the story is compelling. Sparsely written, fast moving and brutally frank Crews examines the cause of his disfunction in his characters and the consequences their actions have on those around them. It is devastating in its directness and intensity, and a great example of the power of fiction.It’s difficult to imagine how so many of Crews’s other books are out of print.Sounds like annegeraldine has come to the conclusion most of us come to while enjoying Jane Austen’s final masterpiece, Persuasion:I’m half way through Persuasion. Jesus. Walter Elliot. What an arse. I’m wishing the afflictions of Job on him.Finally, bythelake has valuable lessons to share after reading A Conspiracy of Paper by David Liss:An author I had never heard of but who could resist for £1 at a charity shop on recent visit to London. Worth it as I grabbed it on my way to emergency room yesterday fearing a cracked rib after an energetic football game with my grandson who tackledor tripped me up. Six hours later, no broken bones on x-ray but found the tale of the shady world of stock speculation (leading to South Sea Bubble of 1720) and murder mystery quite a page turner to distract me. I understand now there are other books in the series. Moral of story: never leave home without a book and do not play football with a 5 year old!Words to live by.Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Several UK train operators, including Northern, Great Western and TransPennine Express, have been told by Network Rail they cannot implement new timetables that are scheduled to come into effect this Sunday over fears of a repeat of the fiasco earlier this year, the Financial Times reported on Monday.The report concluded that the crisis was partly because of the “astonishing complexity” of a fragmented railway that was unable to cope with the scale of the change and described it as a “collective, system-wide failure across Network Rail, the privately owned train operating companies, the Department for Transport and the Office of Rail and Road”. The committee endorsed the conclusion of the government-commissioned Glaister review into the events, that “nobody took charge”.While Grayling had the ultimate authority to stop the implementation of the new timetable, MPs said he was not given all the information he required to make that decision.Labour’s Lilian Greenwood, who chairs the committee, said: “It is extraordinary, and totally unacceptable, that no one took charge of the situation and acted to avert the May timetabling crisis. Instead of experiencing the benefits of much-needed investment in our railways, around one in five passengers experienced intensely inconvenient and costly disruption to their daily lives.”She added: “There was extraordinary complacency about protecting the interests of passengers, who were very badly let down.”The committee recommended that oversight of national timetabling be taken away from Network Rail, to insulate the process from commercial and political pressures.Robert Nisbet of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents the industry, said it was “learning the lessons” and had set up a dedicated “timetable assurance team” to assess future changes and ensure they were introduced smoothly, starting with this weekend’s revisions. He added that an additional compensation scheme had already reduced the cost of travel for season ticket holders most affected by the May debacle.Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: “This devastating report lays the blame clearly: the disastrous fragmentation of our railways and with Chris Grayling. Passengers deserve nothing less than his resignation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38c6a1cd31bdb339c0ad939e4ed687470a259163/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72dbb4c07dc3d526cc37583c3ceed995","title":"their ideas had no place here how crete kicked out golden dawn","story":"Teachers and activists in Heraklion explain how they drove the ultra-nationalist, far-right Greek party from the islandWashing hangs from the balconies of an unassuming apartment block on Irodotou street in Heraklion, the capital of Crete. Outside, children ride bikes and old men play cards in a coffee shop. But before May this year, this building looked rather different. A sign hung outside reading: “Golden Dawn, Heraklion region”. The ultra-nationalist, far-right Greek party used this street as its local base.It was local teachers who first spotted its influence. “Two of my 13-year-old students had family problems,” recalls Maria Oikonomaki, 50. “Golden Dawn approached them in cafes and the gym, presenting themselves as family and protectors. They took them for coffee and gave them lessons on Greek history.”Then came the violence, including the stabbing of two Pakistani workers. “I thought to myself: ‘My god, what is happening in this neighbourhood?’” says Oikonomaki.​Despite the attacks, Golden Dawn might ​have kept its foothold in Heraklion – or ​dug in deeper – had the city’s residents not decided to fight back.Golden Dawn was formed in 1980 and remained a fringe party until Greece’s devastating financial crisis started in 2009. As faith in the major political parties ebbed away, Golden Dawn’s narrative of a once-great nation ruined by immigration struck a chord with some disillusioned voters. As well as becoming the third-largest party in the Greek parliament, it also established a street-based paramilitary wing that regularly attacked immigrants and political opponents.The area it chose in Heraklion was the eastern suburb of Nea Alikarnassos. A working-class neighbourhood, it has a long history of immigration from Asia Minor and eastern Europe. Many residents are employed in construction and lost their jobs during the crisis. Golden Dawn quietly opened its office here in 2011.Crete’s anti-fascist movement initially struggled to fight back. “Our philosophy is that you never let the far right get hold of public space,” says Konstantinos (not his real name), a militant anti-fascist in his early 20s. “In warmer countries like Greece, public space is where the working class spends their lives. Wherever fascists are present, you have to make your presence felt too.”So, when they found out about the new office, Konstantinos and other activists arranged a neighbourhood assembly. “There was a general consensus that people didn’t want Golden Dawn in the area,” he says, “but not enough people came to support the assembly. We realised we couldn’t have a presence in the area all the time. We tried to keep an eye on them, but there wasn’t much we could do.”In September 2012, everything changed. In a crime that shocked the country, the prominent anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas was allegedly murdered on Golden Dawn’s orders. Huge protests broke out and 69 members of the party, including its leader, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, and 18 MPs, were arrested and charged with running a criminal organisation. Their trial is ongoing.“Before this, a lot of people had the attitude of ‘We do not fear Golden Dawn, we just need to educate them’,” says Haris Zafiropoulos, a 27-year-old activist with New Left Current, a coalition of left-wing groups.Activists such as Zafiropoulos embarked on a new strategy: taking to the streets and engaging in face-to-face conversations about fascism and why it needed to be confronted.“Every weekend we went to the neighbourhood and spoke to people,” Zafiropoulos says. “Crete suffered a lot from the Nazis in the second world war, and whole villages were burned down. We tried to remind people what had happened before, and what is happening now.”Meanwhile, across Crete, teachers rallied to address the radicalisation taking place in schools. “The way the fascists moved within the pupil community was so clever and so sneaky, we did not realise what was going on at first,” says Fotis Bichakis, founder of the Cretan League of Anti-Fascist Teachers. “It was easy for young students who were feeling frustrated to become manipulated.”The teachers worked together to prepare lesson plans that taught history in a less nationalist way and explained and confronted fascist ideologies. The following spring, 56 schools collaborated on an anti-fascist festival.The teachers chose not to view already-recruited students as lost causes. “We always had faith they could come back to democratic ideals,” adds Bichakis. “As they saw more of their peers joining in with anti-fascism, they began to question whether they had been misled.”Oikonomaki says she believes the strategy stopped any more of her pupils being radicalised. “We had students from Albania, Romania, Bulgaria,” she says. “I’d tell pupils: ‘Golden Dawn says other people are inferior to Greeks. Do you really think that about your friend John you sit next to every day?’”Militant activists also made the controversial decision to confront the group violently. In April 2018, Konstantinos and around 70 other anti-fascists organised a night attack on the Heraklion office. “We destroyed everything of value – the floors, the ceilings, the AC unit,” he says. “We think that was the final straw for them.”Indeed, Golden Dawn packed up and left two weeks later.Not everyone in the community is happy about the violence. “It’s important we don’t come across as two sides of the same coin,” says Zafiropoulos.Konstantinos, however, is unrepentant. “It worked!” he says. “We may not be able to stop Golden Dawn becoming celebrities in the media, but we can stop them spreading their roots within Greek society. Crete is the first major region of Greece to have no Golden Dawn presence … We have effectively stopped them from having any space to reproduce.”Elsewhere in Greece, the far right appears to be on the rise again. The country’s dispute with Macedonia over its name has led to swell of nationalism, and there have been violent attacks on politicians and asylum-seekers. Halikiopoulou believes anti-fascist activism of the type used in Crete can work “on a local level. But opposition cannot and should not be confined to the anti-fascist left. We need something on a more organised, mainstream level.”Oikonomaki is wary of saying the battle is fully over. “We could easily communicate who Golden Dawn were and why they were bad,” she says. “But the crisis is not over, and people still want to put the blame on someone. Hidden fascism is almost more dangerous.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a638ddc90ac195509bcf60a07d3ec7083adcfef2/235_475_3092_1855/master/3092.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9b6fa385eef0efa897e54dd7fc1a24","title":"hiding prince bin salman g20 summit","story":"New friends are made, old friends are reunited – and Donald Trump thinks he’s on I’m a Celebrity …Remember last year’s G20 summit, when Angela Merkel started grinding on people when Kraftwerk came on? And Christine Lagarde got trashed and started telling maths-based jokes and nobody knew what she was on about?This year’s was just as much a hoot, rivalling a D12 after-show or one of B*Witched’s legendary house parties. Fun and games in Buenos Aires with the odd autocratic murder suspect thrown in. And who among us doesn’t like to stand in front of flags all day reading off an autocue? Who doesn’t love running out of water 20 minutes into a 90-minute long meeting? Who isn’t hyped to hide in a lift to avoid Mohammed bin Salman?Allow me to take you through some of the key moments of the summit: the highlights, the lowlights, the actual dying of the light.This picture could not look more like a couple’s therapy session immediately after they are asked, “Right, who wants to begin then?” by an analyst wearing half-glasses on a chain. Nobody says anything and then both burst into complaints at once. Extra amusingly, it looks like one of the chair feet is Theresa May’s leg. A tiny, tiny leg. I may or may not have laughed at this for far too long. Anyway, that’s £90 please – see you next Tuesday, same time?This is Angela Merkel surrounded by mere mortals and checking her watch, having absolutely no time for them because she is, for a bit longer at least, the de facto leader of Europe and she studied quantum chemistry. Angela doesn’t wanna hear it, whatever it is. Did you study quantum chemistry? Well then.In further proof that ANGELA DOESN’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS, here she sits across from Australian prime minister Scott Morrison brazenly reading (genuinely) what amounts to a Wikipedia printout on Scott Morrison. She’s allowed to do this, because she is the de facto leader of Europe and she studied quantum chemistry.Just when you think it’s impossible for Donald Trump to become any more like Selina Meyer (as seen in Veep) he raises the bar. Here he is wandering from the stage, leaving Argentine president Mauricio Macri nonplussed and embarrassed in front of the assembled press, while an aide runs after Trump who can be heard murmuring, “Get me out of here.” I’m A F*cking Idiot, Get Me Out of Here!Here is Xi Jinping making the exact face women make when random men on public transport insist on interrupting them so we have to take a headphone out, and then they ask a banal question, followed by: “Sorry, am I interrupting?” Yes, this is the definition of interrupting. Petition idea: to allow women to listen to This American Life for at least two stops. And no, I don’t fancy coffee some time.This photo is very “one minute pause before The X Factor winner is announced”. Get ready for either Paraguay’s president, Mario Abdo Benitez, or Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe to be signed to Simon Cowell’s Syco (I see what you did there!!) label for all of five minutes release a cover butchering a pop classic and then quietly return to the pub-and-club circuit with all promo materials bearing a low-quality X Factor logo, definitely breaking trademark laws.In extraordinary scenes (a redundant phrase these days), here is Macron and the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, having a low-key discussion (in front of a camera) in which MBS (More Bullshit) tells the French president, “Don’t worry.” Macron – speaking for all of us – replies, “I am worried.” He follows up, “You never listen to me.” This could be a normal leader-to-leader tiff, except it’s almost certainly about the fact one of them is a moral vacuum. Still – a great friend of the UK! :-))))This is what is known as a “nice one, human rights-suppressing bro!” high five. They are mostly done discreetly, and not audaciously in front of the world’s press, but who even gives a shit any more?I’d love to know who designed this awful backdrop, which looks like when the Daily Mail is forced to pixellate the face of a celebrity’s child, mostly because they’ve referred to her as being “leggy” despite the fact she is six years old. What we have here is Victoria Vorontsova, the deputy editor-in-chief of Spanish RT (I know), and Hernan Lombardi, the head of Argentina’s system of media and public content, holding certificates for taking part. Or that is what it looks like, judging by the expressions on their faces.I used to mock Melania Trump for still shoulder-robing like it was still 2012, but she does it so often now that I just genuinely don’t think she understands how sleeves work.Angela coming to steal your man. Who probably doesn’t even have a degree in quantum chemistry.Once again we have the camel-eyelashed Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, looking like a smug Ken doll who can almost certainly commune with dolphins and probably uses the Amaro filter on every Instagram picture he posts, mostly of lakes. He flirts with your mum all dinner and then rolls his shirt sleeves up – maybe even takes the whole thing off – and offers to do the washing up, even though there’s a dishwasher."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b74f8063a5d17e790b7a44f74122956e12d89a30/87_0_2282_1369/master/2282.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a92ee5660e989259d3f27fd9f01b9f7","title":"politicians bickering brexit abyss","story":"The only question worth asking is should we still do Brexit. The rest is a distractionLet the chronicles of this turbulent time record how the prime minister and the leader of the opposition agreed that Britain should leave the European Union, so they argued instead about which channel should host an argument between them. Theresa May wants to defend her Brexit deal on the BBC Jeremy Corbyn prefers to attack it on ITV. It is the perfect culmination of British politics since the referendum: a confected row over a piece of theatre to avoid a real debate.Parliament starts hearing arguments over May’s plan on Tuesday. This should be the final ascent, the peak of a democratic process, but the climb has been a mapless scramble through fog. The view from the summit will not be much clearer than it was in the foothills, when no one had a clue how to untangle EU membership, and only charlatans and fools said it would be easy.To expect lucidity from May is to ignore her record. This is the prime minister who coined “Brexit means Brexit” – a slogan so exquisitely vacuous it might be conceptual art. She knows no strategy beyond secrecy and the dead bat. Likewise, there is no evidence that Corbyn can bring public insight to a European dilemma. Last week, he was on breakfast television saying that Labour would have time to arrange a new Brexit deal in “a transition period which has already been now agreed”. But transition has been agreed as a condition of the deal Corbyn aims to destroy. What he said was either cynically misleading or frighteningly ill-informed.Both would be consistent with the pattern of politics since 2016. The referendum did little to inform or elevate national debate on all things European. On balance, the leave campaign was the more duplicitous of the two sides, but that is no reflection on the motive or character of leave voters. Ignorance of the EU was rife among remainers too. Pretty much everyone followed their gut no one was pondering phytosanitary inspections at busy ports. There was little grasp, on either side, of the strategic magnitude of what was being proposed – not just the uprooting and replanting of the economy, but fracturing the political alliance that has underpinned British foreign policy for a generation.We conspired to hold a referendum on leaving the EU without a serious conversation about what the EU even is, let alone what it does. Then, a year later, we got through a general election campaign with little mention of Europe at all. Another year has passed and, despite the urgency of the article 50 clock running out, politics still manages to distract itself with arguments other than the only one worth having, which is this: given what we now know about Brexit that we didn’t know then, should we still do it?That is not the question on which May and Corbyn would dwell in a televised debate (regardless of the channel). It isn’t a question that troubles hardline Tory backbenchers running up and down Westminster corridors in pursuit of letters of no confidence in their leader. It isn’t a question that can be answered by publication of the attorney general’s legal advice on the withdrawal agreement, prised piecemeal by opposition parties from the clenched fist of government. That isn’t to say these things are unimportant. It matters if Geoffrey Cox QC advises that the Irish “backstop” is a trapdoor to perpetual regulatory subordination. But it matters only as confirmation of a structural downside to Brexit that we know already – the imbalance of power between a bloc of 27 states and one quitter. There is no obscure parliamentary procedure or elegantly crafted amendment that changes the cost-benefit equation. May’s Brexit isn’t uniquely, freakishly deleterious to the national interest. It is just Brexit. If that’s what MPs want, they should vote for it. Either the price is worth paying, for whatever reason – a trade deal with Donald Trump, fewer Romanians on the bus, blue passports – or it isn’t.But I suspect we haven’t finished with displacement activity. There are still a few implausible 11th-hour renegotiations to be demanded. Labour can still call for a general election, without saying what the Brexit chapter in their manifesto would contain. The Tories might squeeze in a leadership contest. The drivel-soaked sponge of no-deal complacency has not been wrung completely dry on the Today programme. Boris Johnson is still at large. Nigel Farage has space in his diary.It is tempting to decry an excess of game-playing in British public life, but that doesn’t do justice to the debasement. A bit of sporting mischief is a normal aspect of politics. Sometimes the play gets a bit dirty sometimes we all take our eye off the ball. But in the current climate it feels as if the pitch itself and the goals have been forgotten altogether. Politics has become endless fighting in the stands, while sensible people flee the stadium.I can see why this spectacle puts people off another referendum. Not much about the past few years promises a festival of reasoned dialogue. But I also want to resist such fatalism. When politicians say that another vote would be isive and bitter, they are wriggling out from responsibility to raise the tone themselves. They mean they cannot imagine doing politics differently. Actually, it isn’t a warning but a threat: proceed with Brexit or we will degrade your public discourse even further. Submission to that menace is not a good reason to leave the EU, it just adds to the list of bad ones.Maybe it is fanciful to imagine a different kind of campaign, one that would be seized as an opportunity to rehabilitate responsible political debate. In more optimistic moments, I hope there is one more chapter in the Brexit chronicle, written in a style more befitting the seriousness of the question. Otherwise what is the story being told about our democracy? We bickered for years on the edge of an abyss, then dropped wearily in because we could no longer trust ourselves to discuss the merit in jumping."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e7fa1c7e91901b968b3e005d28fb1ffe60e3276/739_645_4926_2956/master/4926.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0de069bc648d3c9b05f3f0ded27de7a","title":"the guardian view on disability and the arts time for change","story":"For years, the arts in the UK have made ersity a priority and, gradually, this is paying off. On stage, audiences are used to black actors taking on roles in Shakespeare plays gender-blind casting is gaining ground black and minority ethnic leaders are slowly being appointed to major roles – such as, recently, Kwame Kwei-Armah at the Young Vic and Madani Younis at the Southbank Centre, both in London. But there is one area in which change has been all but imperceptible: disability. Britain’s Got Talent – and its last winner, the comedian Lost Voice Guy – has done more for the popular standing of artists with disabilities in Britain than any of its publicly funded cultural organisations.Directors and trustees of arts organisations – those who can make change at the top by appointing leaders – are overwhelmingly able-bodied. This makes it depressing, but not necessarily a surprise, that not a single publicly funded arts body is run by a disabled person, except for those organisations with a specific disability arts focus. And that is just the staff: access for disabled audience members to culture, from museums and galleries to theatres and concert halls, can be terrible, leading to miserable experiences (or simply no possibility of access at all), especially for those who use wheelchairs. The Edinburgh fringe is a particular culprit – understandable to an extent from young companies working on a shoestring, but not from huge commercial promoters who have the resources to do better.There is also a lack of understanding of the needs of those with disabilities among those who work in the arts, which can lead to some embarrassing, hurtful and cruel episodes – such as when a young woman with Asperger’s was ejected from a BFI screening this spring (for which the organisation has since apologised).This has to change, and the government is to be commended for appointing a disability champion for arts and culture to address these problems. There are a number of simple measures that could help. For instance, the UK-wide adoption of the kind of disability charter that Northern Ireland has used for the past 20 years, which enshrines the rights of audience members and lays out best practice for employers. Bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund should consider targeted grants to make venues – and, importantly, their offices – accessible to disabled people. There is much that could, and should, be done to make training, apprenticeships and arts-focused higher education more available to people with disabilities. An “arts access card” would ease the problems that disabled people often encounter when attempting to book tickets – something Wales is already doing with its Hynt card. The UK’s arts organisations pride themselves on their openness, fairness and visionary thinking. Now is the time to act on those principles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/380c1fef3cafa6621fd61684c658d065f5c4e3a8/0_0_1665_999/master/1665.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b99d86b43b87a1dba61d3dd2a0959a32","title":"campaigners criticise 50m fund for grammar schools expansion","story":"Headteachers and campaigners fighting cuts to special needs education call move ‘sickening’Headteachers and campaigners for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) have reacted with fury to a government announcement that 16 grammar schools are to split a £50m bonus to create new school places.Making the announcement on Monday, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, said the 16 schools chosen to receive the additional funding out of 39 applications had been given permission to expand after setting out clear actions to prioritise access for disadvantaged children.“I have always been clear that selective schools will only be able to expand if they meet the high bar we have set for increasing access for disadvantaged children, and all of these schools have done that,” Hinds said. “As a result, countless more children from disadvantaged areas will benefit from places at outstanding schools.”Headteachers who have been campaigning for months to highlight the funding crisis in their schools described the move as “ill-judged”. Campaigners who are fighting SEND cuts to their children’s education through the courts said it was “sickening”.“It’s difficult to stomach the backdoor expansion of grammar schools while inclusive schools are being financially penalised and special educational needs funding is in crisis,” said a spokesperson for SEND Family Action. “Attending these schools is simply not an option for many pupils with SEND.”Dr Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the £50m boost would benefit very few children. “Yet again the government shows its complete lack of understanding of the huge funding crisis in our schools. This will be a huge disappointment to the majority of non selective schools and colleges facing financial hardship.”Headteachers who marched on Westminster in September to bring the financial crisis in their schools to the attention of ministers also expressed their disappointment. Jules White, the headteacher of Tanbridge House school in West Sussex and leader of the Worth Less? fair funding lobby, which represents 7,000 headteachers across 60 local authorities, said all schools deserved better funding.“When the Department for Education only ever talks about efficiencies rather than proper investment for schools, we are concerned that today’s announcement is ill-judged. In short, it will cost £12,500 to fund each new place under this capital expansion project.“It seems that the Treasury and the DfE can always find money for projects that suit an ideological direction. At the same time, when the need to fund each child’s education properly arises, we are told that money is in short supply.”The opening of new grammar schools is barred by legislation passed under Tony Blair’s government in 1998, but the current government has made plain it is keen to increase the number of grammar school places, and in May Hinds announced the selective schools expansion fund, despite fierce opposition from educationalists and policy-makers.The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: “Today’s announcement is a stark reminder that the Conservatives have nothing to offer the overwhelming majority of schools apart from more cuts.“At a time when the chancellor promises only ‘little extras’ for almost every school, the government are handing out millions to a handful of cherry-picked grammar schools which will do nothing for almost every child in the country.” The government says the 16 grammar schools who have been awarded the additional funds have pledged to prioritise children who are eligible for the pupil premium for admission – these are children from the lowest income families.The schools also had to outline measures to improve outreach to children and families who might not otherwise consider applying to grammar school, including free entrance test materials available online and visits to primary schools and mentoring by sixth formers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

Solveig tweeted shortly after the ceremony, saying he had apologised to Hegerberg for the remark.“He came to me afterwards and was really sad that it went that way,” The Norwegian forward said. “I didn’t really consider it sexual harassment or anything in the moment. I was just happy to do the dance and win the Ballon d’Or.”Hegerberg added she was extremely proud to be named the first female winner. “It’s incredible,” she said. “This is a great motivation to continue working hard and we will continue to work together to win more titles. I wanted to end with some words for young girls around the world: believe in yourselves.”Andy Murray was among those on social media who criticised Solveig’s comment, calling it “another example of the ridiculous sexism in sport.”“What questions did they ask Mbappé and Modric?” the British tennis player added on Instagram. “I’d imagine something to do with football. And to everyone who thinks I’m overreacting and it was just a joke ... it wasn’t. I’ve been involved in sport my whole life and the level of sexism is unreal.”Modric won a third straight Champions League title and inspired his country to reach the World Cup final, and there are few who will begrudge his victory, with Ronaldo in second.

This was down from the previous week, which itself had been a record low.Four members of the England team which beat Croatia to qualify for the Uefa Nations League finals last month did not start for their club sides this weekend and Southgate has called for action to stop the trend.“For parents and boys entering academies, the very nature of it is that you expect there to be opportunity at the end. I go back to previous tournaments when we have reviewed everything that has gone on in English football. So many of those things are in the right place now, so this is just the missing piece. But that is a conundrum we have to solve.”The FA recently drew up proposals to reduce the maximum number of non-homegrown players in any 25-man squad from 17 to 13, a proposal it suggested could be implemented when the UK left the European Union. This suggestion was given short shrift by the Premier League, however, who said that there was “no evidence” that quotas would have a positive impact on national teams.Southgate said discussions were ongoing regarding quotas but that change was imperative for the continuing development of English football. “What’s clear is that we can’t allow the trend to continue as it is because at what point do we stop?” he said. “Everybody saw the impact and the success of the national team in the summer and I think it is now prerogative that, while we still want a competitive Premier League that brings a lot of focus into our country as well, it’s just trying to find this missing piece of development for English football.”Southgate believes the FA and Premier League clubs are in fact in agreement on the importance of progressing young homegrown talent from academy sides to the first team, but that the pressure placed on managers and coaches means they are unwilling to take a risk on inexperienced players."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e97f647ecd236ebe0ed8897f70bde7e2de122b6/0_324_6239_3744/master/6239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12bfbf79b3acf8f5e86f647edb363da1","title":"guardian honours football supporters federation","story":"• Sixth straight newspaper-of-the-year title is won• Football Weekly podcast and Barney Ronay also honoured was honoured three times at the Football Supporters’ Federation awards on Monday.The paper was awarded newspaper of the year for the sixth consecutive year, decided by more than 40,000 voting fans.Barney Ronay, senior sports writer, was voted football writer of the year after a stellar 12 months which ranged from the struggle to save Millwall’s ground to the World Cup final in Moscow.Football Weekly, the ’s football podcast, was awarded podcast of the year for the second year running and the fifth time in the last six years.

Uefa officials believe the integrity of one of the organisation’s key rules is under threat and that sporting sanctions are the only appropriate response should City be found to have flouted them.The Premier League champions were previously fined £49m for contravening FFP in 2014 but avoided a more severe punishment and subsequently had the fine reduced to £18m after complying with operational and financial measures agreed as part of the punishment.Emails published as part of the Football Leaks revelations, however, suggest that City’s actions had been deeper and more widespread than initially thought.In one correspondence Jorge Chumillas, City’s chief financial officer, appears to reveal that an apparent sponsorship deal by Etihad Airlines, worth £68m to the club, was in fact largely to be paid directly to City by the club’s owners, the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG).Der Spiegel also claimed that as City began to become concerned about failing to meet FFP standards they set up a “closed payment loop” in which ADUG paid a third party to pay City for the image rights to their players.

He said he had “sought to comply with the spirit of it to the maximum degree” by putting himself before MPs and publishing a 45-page summary earlier in the day.Ominously for May, some hard-Brexit MPs said they were unsatisfied by the decision to defy an earlier Commons resolution calling for full publication.Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Cox of not explaining why ministers were refusing to comply with the Commons motion. “It is no longer a matter for the government to judge it has been decided by this house, which is a higher authority,” he said.On 13 November, the Commons unanimously agreed to a motion put down by Labour calling for the legal advice on the Brexit deal to be published “in full”. Conservative MPs were told to abstain after it became clear that the government was not certain of winning the vote when the DUP said it would vote with Labour.Cox told the Commons on Monday that the government had made a mistake at the time. He said: “We should have opposed it,” although he added that he would not have complied even if the vote had been lost.The government’s chief lawyer sought to sell the Brexit deal to MPs on the grounds that it represented “a calculated risk”.He was asked by Joanna Cherry of the SNP if there was anything to prevent the Northern Ireland backstop, under which the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU after Brexit, becoming permanent.Cox replied: “As a matter of international law, no,” but added that if the backstop did become permanent, it would be “highly vulnerable to legal challenge” within EU law.Downing Street had hoped to start persuading backbenchers to support May’s deal despite widespread concern in her party that the UK could become trapped in the backstop. May spoke with small groups of backbench MPs in her Commons office throughout the day.On Tuesday, the prime minister will openthe five-day debate leading up to the final vote next week by saying that the British people have already twice voted to deliver Brexit.The prime minister will argue that the British public showed what they wanted “by voting overwhelmingly for parties that committed to delivering Brexit” in the referendum and in the 2017 election Both Conservative and Labour manifestos at the last election said they respected the leave vote in the 2016 referendum.Tuesday’s debate will be closed by the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the following days will be themed, with senior cabinet ministers speaking in support of the deal.Wednesday’s theme will be security and the debate will be opened by the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and closed by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary. On Thursday, the focus will be on the economy, opened by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and closed by the international trade secretary, Liam Fox."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f3837c7b2e1391ba67d566de1962d997efd7795/14_0_1688_1013/master/1688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399ee9e662697e43a1ad53a69dc37473","title":"geoffrey cox milks his moment in commons spotlight","story":"By the end of his opening soliloquy, almost no one could remember a word he’d saidBoom. The deep baritone of Geoffrey Cox echoed round the chamber. This was the crowning moment of the attorney general’s long and extremely well-paid legal career. The number one court at the Old Bailey had nothing on a full house in Westminster. Especially when his back was to the wall defending the near indefensible. These were the days when it was very heaven to be alive. The lights. The greasepaint. The action.Last month the Commons passed a humble address ordering the government to publish the attorney general’s Brexit legal advice and now Cox was in the house to explain in person why he didn’t think that was at all a good idea. Boom. Cox began in full Laurence Olivier in Richard III mode. Now was the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this house of May. There was barely a murmur. He had the audience in his hands from the moment he started speaking.He had a solemn and constitutional duty, which he would discharge with uncompromising fidelity, he insisted. Indeed, so objective and impartial did he wish to appear that he had gone out of his way to give a 52-page summary of his original six-page legal advice. Almost all of which could already be found in the withdrawal agreement.“Verily,” he declaimed, sweeping his arms wide open. There were problems with the backstop and on a narrow point of law it could not be ended unilaterally. But, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it was inconceivable that either the EU and the UK would ever dream of not acting in good faith, and even if one party should – by some mishappenstance – seek to spin out the negotiations beyond 16 years then the whole legality of article 50 would come into question.The opening soliloquy lasted for a full 18 minutes – most statements are over in 10 at most – and by the end even Cox could see that he was beginning to lose his audience. There was only a certain amount of amateur theatrics that everyone could take – MPs are uniquely averse to others getting too much attention – and when the house lights went up and Cox finally exited stage left, almost no one could remember a word he had said. Which may have been the whole point.The shadow attorney general, Nick Thomas-Symonds, cut to the chase. He wisely didn’t try to out-thesp Cox. Instead he stuck to the basics. The Commons had ordered the government to publish its full legal advice and the government had refused. End of. Cox was in contempt. And while he was about it, could the attorney general list one positive thing about the summary he had given so far?Boom. “Mr Speaker,” Cox declared plaintively, dabbing a tear from his eye. “All he has to do is ask and he shall receive. For I shall answer.” In an instant, he morphed from Olivier to a music hall Henry Irving. A second-rate Victorian actor-manager who was hell-bent on milking the occasion for every last drop of emotion. His hand thudded into the despatch box, to everyone’s general amusement. Cox looked momentarily disconcerted. This was his finest Lear, not his Malvolio.Boom. Like the old pro that he is, Cox soon regained his composure. On to his Dickens. It is a far, far better thing I do... There was nothing – NOTHING – he would have loved to have done more than give parliament his full legal advice. But it would be a matter of public harm for him to do so. More than that, it would be against the will of God. Parliament may think it knew best, but it was his sad duty to report that it didn’t.“There is nothing to see here,” he quavered in full am-dram ham. Yes there were risks, but these were mere political – not legal – calculations. The quality of mercy is not strained. Besides, he was just one lawyer among many hundreds. There were many different legal opinions available. Just for a moment, he could almost imagine himself to be a junior barrister defending a shoplifting charge at Snaresbrook magistrates court, rather than the attorney general. Almost. Cox could never let his extreme self-regard entirely slip.Cox’s perorations didn’t begin to satisfy most MPs on both sides and long before the end of his two-and-a-half-hour session he had been given notice that contempt proceedings would be brought against the government. But Cox could live with that. OK, so he normally didn’t get out of bed for less than £800 an hour, but so what if he had performed for peanuts? This had been his never-to-be-forgotten masterclass for lawyers and MPs alike. The achievement of a lifetime. His finest hour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd56f2afc3e3fc2359e2ef3563663dbfd846a0af/113_0_4828_2897/master/4828.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0040c3a091df36e49263969e05428b1","title":"nasa osiris rex bennu asteroid","story":" Osiris-Rex spacecraft will eventually scoop up material for analysis back homeAfter a two-year chase, a Nasa probe has reached the ancient asteroid Bennu. The robotic explorer Osiris-Rex pulled within 12 miles (19km) of the diamond-shaped object on Monday and will go into orbit around it on 31 December. No spacecraft has ever orbited such a small body.Bennu is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid – it is due to make a close pass of Earth about 150 years. If it collided with Earth, Bennu would probably cause a crater.Osiris-Rex aims to collect at least 60 grams (two ounces) of dust and gravel, the first such attempt by the US after a smaller mission to another asteroid by Japan. The spacecraft won’t land but use a three-metre mechanical arm in 2020 to momentarily touch down and pick up particles. The sample container is planned to break loose and head toward Earth in 2021.The collection – parachuting down to Utah – would represent the biggest such haul since the Apollo astronauts hand-delivered moon rocks to Earth in the late 1960s and early 1970s.Scientists hope to learn more about the source of water in the solar system and the origins of organic molecules from which life first arose. Getting their hands on pristine asteroid material might also yield clues about how to mine them for valuable materials and defend against wayward ones that might threaten Earth.Flight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives on Monday once confirmation came through that Osiris-Rex made it to Bennu – exactly one week after Nasa landed a spacecraft on Mars.“Relieved, proud, and anxious to start exploring!” tweeted lead scientist Dante Lauretta of the University of Arizona. “To Bennu and back!”Bennu is 76m miles (122m km) away so it took seven minutes for word of the success to reach flight controllers at Lockheed Martin in Littleton, Colorado, where the spacecraft was built.Bennu is estimated to be just over 1,600ft (500 metres) across. Researchers will provide a more precise description at a scientific meeting on Monday next week in Washington.About the size of a large car, the spacecraft will shadow the asteroid for a year, before scooping up some gravel for return to Earth in 2023.A Japanese spacecraft, meanwhile, has been hanging out at another near-Earth asteroid since June, also for samples. It is Japan’s second asteroid mission. This latest rock is named Ryugu and is about double the size of Bennu.Ryugu’s specks should be here by December 2020 but will be far less than Osiris-Rex’s promised booty.Nasa has brought back comet dust and solar wind particles before but never asteroid samples. Japan managed to return some tiny particles in 2010 from its first asteroid mission, named Hayabusa.Contact with Bennu will not significantly change its orbit or make it more dangerous to Earth, Lauretta stressed.The $800m Osiris-Rex mission began with a 2016 launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Its odometer read 1.2bn miles (2bn km) as of Monday.Both the spacecraft and asteroid’s names come from Egyptian mythology. Osiris is the god of the afterlife, while Bennu represents the heron and creation.Osiris-Rex is actually a Nasa acronym for origins, spectral interpretation, resource identification, security-regolith explorer.Associated Press contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d80a8142dea6d88a97a5a83eb5058fde03c5282b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e8054f2148bd6b3c65b74d7f6ea64fb","title":"tough as old boots a thames skeletons durable footwear tideway tunnel","story":"Archaeologists say man who died 500 years ago may have been a mudlark or fishermanHe was found lying on his front, head twisted to the side. One arm was bent above his head, suggesting he had fallen – or perhaps had been pushed – to his death in the river more than five centuries ago.But aside from his puzzling position, the skeleton discovered this year near the shore of the Thames in London was notable for another, very particular reason. Though his clothes had long since decayed, on the man’s feet were a pair of remarkably well preserved – and extremely rare – knee-high leather boots. Might they hold clues, archaeologists wondered, to who the man was and, just possibly, how he died?The mystery of the man in the medieval wellies was uncovered in Bermondsey by archaeologists working on the Thames Tideway tunnel, the so-called “super-sewer” currently being built to update the capital’s Victorian sewage network.It’s not unusual to find bodies on the foreshore, but the style and preservation of the man’s footwear, made of leather “quarters” stitched together with waxed flax thread, is exceptional, say archaeologists.“Leather can be very well preserved in London, especially if it’s found in a ditch that would have been full of water, or near the riverfront,” said Beth Richardson, a finds specialist for the archaeological team from Mola Headland Infrastructure. In the absence of any metalwork or other dating evidence, the style of the boots – unheeled, with a single, flat sole reinforced with “clump soles” at the front and back – dated the skeleton to the late 1400s or early 1500s at the latest.The fact that they reach the knee makes it likely the boots were waders, experts think, making it possible the man worked in or around the river as a dock worker, mudlark or fisherman. Mariners of the time were known to wear long boots, according to Richardson, as evidenced by the large number found on the wreck of the Tudor warship the Mary Rose.And like their modern-day welly-boot equivalent, they are nothing fancy. “These were very simple boots,” says Richardson. They are not fashionable at all, they haven’t got buckles or anything like that – they are just practical, everyday boots.” Conservation work to preserve the leather is still ongoing, and there is no immediate plan to put the boots on display.Plant matter found inside the boots is yet to be analysed, but the archaeologists suspect it was a lining of moss that had been added to keep the man’s feet warm as he waded.Even without his distinctive footwear, however, there are clues to his identity. Evidence of extensive degenerative joint disease along his spine and left hip joint show he lived a physical life and would have suffered pain every day, according to Niamh Carty, an osteologist. Though she could not rule out that he was younger than 35, she believes he was probably much older.In addition, the man has distinctive grooves in his teeth, “a possible indication of pulling some sort of material over the biting surface of the teeth or holding an object in the teeth for prolonged periods of time,” said Carty. One possibility is that he was pulling rope between his teeth, as a fisherman might.As for how the man came to die, we will never know for sure, but there is no evidence of foul play, according to the archaeologists.“He may have been working in the river and the tide got too much for him, he may have fallen over, he may have been tired,” Richardson said. “He may have had too much to drink. We really don’t know.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8eea6cc492bfc43a1d5b43d51afaf6bedf865796/0_266_3991_2395/master/3991.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf6f18bcb374c29c22fc5346d296637b","title":"kalashnikov arkle trophy plumpton cheltenham","story":"“I didn’t watch a lot of it,” Amy Murphy admitted after her stable star Kalashnikov maintained his unbeaten record over fences here on Monday. “But it sounded very good.” It looked very good, too, as Kalashnikov ran away with the novice chase without leaving second gear and last year’s Betfair Hurdle winner is now the 5-1 joint-favourite with Lalor for the Arkle Trophy at Cheltenham in March.The downhill fences on the far side of this track can make it a difficult test for a novice.

At the start of this year Hall had never won an LPGA tournament as a professional. She ends it having celebrated the fact her first victory in Europe happened to be a major, when she won the British Open in August, and that she has broken into the world’s top 10.The 22-year-old from Bournemouth had to struggle to reach this point because, as the daughter of a plasterer, she did not always have the money to play in tournaments for which she had already qualified. Her life is much easier now, as she received a winner’s cheque of £375,000 after winning the Open at Royal Lytham, and the clarity of Hall’s ambition is soon apparent.Hall responds emphatically when asked if she would prefer to become the world’s best golfer before winning another major. “Yeah, I’d take world No 1 for sure. That’s the dream.”Her victory was made more special because her father, Wayne, was her caddie for the week. A golf nut who had named her Georgia in honour of Nick Faldo’s victory in the Masters at Augusta shortly before her birth in April 1996, Wayne Hall takes over from Tyrrell at every Open. “He’s always done the British and the Scottish Open. Harry doesn’t mind stepping down those two weeks. He knows it’s a big thing for my dad.”On the Sunday afternoon Hall trailed Thailand’s Pornanong Phatlum by a single shot. They were pitted against each other in the last pairing, which became a compelling shootout. Hall’s final round of 67 sealed her victory by two shots from Phatlum. “I was in a perfect position,” Hall suggests, “because I kept saying: ‘Why am I nervous? Someone else must be more nervous because she’s leading. So, Georgia, calm down.’ It helped that Pornanong smiles a lot and we both settled down to play well. I was very calm.“It was far harder on the Saturday front nine. I was the most nervous I’ve ever been but I holed eight big putts in six holes – most were 25-footers. After that I thought: ‘This is my tournament now.’ I was trying to control my emotions all week. I knew if I got caught up in the atmosphere I would have lost the tournament. My dad was very nervous but we didn’t say one word about winning. We just talked about the next shot, which I liked.”Her dad wore the same pair of socks every day as, after the first of four successive sub-70 rounds, he did not want to change her luck. “I didn’t know that until the last day,” Hall says, wrinkling her nose. “On our way to the club he said: ‘I’ve been wearing the same socks every day, by the way. I was going to change them but you played so well the first day I didn’t.’ Hopefully he’s washed them by now.”There was a deeper family backdrop. “My grandad was really ill and I probably wouldn’t have won without playing for him. Every time I hit a bad shot or got too excited, I would think: ‘Come on, do it for grandad.’ He passed away two weeks later but I’m glad he kind of witnessed it. I phoned him up later on in the day and he was so happy I won.”Her victory came after 15 years of hard work amid challenging financial circumstances. “My dad was a plasterer and my mum a hairdresser. He played golf and took me down to the local driving range when I was seven. I then joined the kids’ club and I was the only girl. There were seven levels, and I got to the top level quickly. I was beating all the boys and they used to hate that. They were quite embarrassed.“I did cross-country and football and I was in the boys’ cricket team. I was the only girl. I was a pretty good batsman because I would swing my bat like a golf club. I used to really whack it. I didn’t know it at the time but it was tough for my parents. They didn’t tell me this until a few years ago. But they always had to sell some things for me to have enough money for golf lessons and tournaments. We lived quite far down south and so dad would drive me for four hours to get to a two-hour lesson and then drive me back – on top of working.“Golf is one of the most expensive sports you can play. You need to pay a lot to join a club, you need golf clubs, all the equipment, lessons. It was hard and I missed three majors I’d qualified for because of a lack of funds. I was in the top three in the world as an amateur but we couldn’t afford to get to me there. I could only get to the British Open. That was frustrating but I always said I will be fine in the end.”Francesco Molinari, who won the 2018 Open, received a cheque for £1.42m which meant he earned £1,045,000 more than Hall. “We’re paid very well on the women’s tour, but we can’t do anything about that big difference. We work just as hard as the men and we’re very good. If you watch an LPGA tournament the standard is incredible. But the men earn so much more.”Tennis is different as women receive the same amount of prize money as the men for winning the grand slams. “Yeah, it’s happened already in tennis even though they’re playing less. Maybe they should play the same number of sets and get paid the same money. We’re playing the same amount of holes as the men.”Hall is taking a break after such a busy year. “I’m going to Barbados. I hope I don’t get bored because the last time I had a holiday I was six years old. We went to Spain for two weeks. So this one feels overdue. I’m purposely flying home first to drop my clubs off to make sure I don’t play on holiday. I have to make sure I don’t hit a ball otherwise my mind won’t be fresh next year.”Does she still play against Harry – who had been hoping to become a professional? “Not for a while,” Hall says, “but he can still hit a golf ball. He’s decent.”Hall smiles when I ask who has won the most over their years of golfing rivalry. “Oh, me. Harry’s won about four times.” Tyrrell shakes his head. “A long time ago.” Does he plan to try to play against a woman who aims to become world No 1? “No,” he says with a grin, “it’s too much.”Hall nods intently. “I’m just very competitive at everything. I just want to win, all the time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a27c1687b4b75dde5559e9d6834ed220464b34d/0_0_4556_2734/master/4556.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c743a232c0ba284decf6216d419082a","title":"burke and hare review a very merry romp about","story":"Jermyn Street theatre, LondonWith a cast of three playing multiple characters, this is an energetic telling of the cadaver-supplying criminalsYou learn something new all the time. I had always assumed that Burke and Hare, who in 1828 supplied Edinburgh anatomists with cadavers, were grave-robbers. But this show, written by Tom Wentworth and first seen at the Watermill, Newbury, reminds us that the couple were cold-blooded killers, responsible for 16 deaths. Grateful as I am for the information, I feel the show strives too hard to be a merry romp and puts more emphasis on the tellers than the tale.The whole point is that there are just three actors – two men and a woman – who play everyone from Burke and Hare to the multiple murder victims and the corpse-hungry Scottish medicos. You could say the show is all about splitting Hares since Alex Parry is one moment the lugubrious killer and the next a foppish traveller or a destitute beggar.Katy Daghorn is even more impressive in that she switches in a second from the shrewish Mrs Hare to a demure servant and at one point, as windows open in the back wall like flaps in an Advent calendar, to the varied occupants of an Edinburgh square.Hayden Wood also moves swiftly from the hard-up Burke to the acquisitive Dr Knox, who is arguably the real villain of the story.There are faint echoes of Sondheim’s Sweeney Todd, especially since it is Hare’s wife, like the pie-making Mrs Lovett, who sees that the dead can be a source of profit. I was reminded even more of The Play That Goes Wrong, in which two of the cast have appeared: although, strictly speaking, everything here goes right, there is the same relentless jokeyness and awareness of the theatre’s absurdity.It is all very deftly done in Abigail Pickard Price’s production. But, precisely because the show sets out to restore the facts, I wish it had told us more about Burke’s trial, the ability of the Hares to escape scot-free and the case’s impact on the medical establishment. I am all for seasonal jollity but, in the end, murder is no joke."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64d47e7588a4414888f26faae8809518245196a9/58_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3a3c2309359e47f300721197e8c9aa","title":"forbes seven year old youtuber ryan toys review made 17m in one year","story":"US toy reviewer Ryan beats UK’s Daniel Middleton to the top spot for highest earningsA seven-year-old American boy who reviews toys has topped a list of the highest-earning YouTube stars after making £17.3m in a year.Ryan, from Ryan ToysReview, made the sum for his online reviews between June 2017 and June 2018.

As a result adult material has flooded the service, where it sits alongside other fandoms for everything from Harry Potter to anime.However, attempts to provide a “safe mode” for younger users have sometimes caused problems. Last month the Tumblr app was removed from Apple’s app store after its filtering system inadvertently allowed some child pornography to appear on the social network.Tumblr’s chief executive, Jeff D’Onofrio, said that as the site has grown, its responsibilities to “different age groups, demographics, cultures, and mindsets” have increased and it has now decided to remove all adult material from 17 December.“We spent considerable time weighing the pros and cons of expression in the community that includes adult content. In doing so, it became clear that without this content we have the opportunity to create a place where more people feel comfortable expressing themselves,” he said.“Bottom line: There are no shortage of sites on the internet that feature adult content. We will leave it to them and focus our efforts on creating the most welcoming environment possible for our community.”Tumblr said all content including photos, videos or gifs that “show real-life human genitals or female-presenting nipples” would be banned, alongside any content that depicts sex acts. The site insisted that it would still allow non-sexualised images of women’s nipples, in situations such as breastfeeding or works of art.Websites such as Tumblr were founded in a different internet era when the focus was on the right to publish material. They are increasingly having to rethink their policies after years of criticism for being too permissive and having weak moderation, with major companies increasingly concerned about the content their adverts are appearing alongside.The decision also reflects challenges at Oath, the media business which owns Tumblr in addition to many former assets of Yahoo and AOL such as the Huffington Post.Oath was founded in a bid to build an online media business that had sufficient scale to challenge Facebook and Google for advertising revenue, but has recently seen the departure of chief executive Tim Armstrong, with its parent company, the US telecoms firm Verizon, taking a closer interest in its activities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92033cd1bfd70f89cd0ea5a2eb61fc5b62d6abf2/0_0_5117_3071/master/5117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dd562203111051eb89bc3fd4e3e08f","title":"five wheelie good cycling and hiking routes in thuringia","story":"From mountain peaks to Unesco-listed woodlands, castles and medieval villages, the German region boasts some of Europe’s most dramatic and enchanting landscapes1 The Rennsteig – Germany’s oldest hiking trailThuringia’s most famous hiking path is steeped in tradition, and known across Europe for its superb scenery. Hundreds of historic boundary stones – the symbol of the Rennsteig – mark the route and tell their own story about how this path was for years a border between the Franconian and Thuringian provinces.The 105-mile route winds down from the town of Eisenach (home of Wartburg Castle), via Suhl, and ends at Blankenstein, right on the current border between Thuringia and Bavaria. Today, there’s also a 120-mile cycle path that runs almost parallel to the walking route, but with longer deviations to avoid too many buttock-bashing hill climbs. But while the cycle path is still a teenager, the classic hiking route is nearly 700 years old. You can sense the souls that have trodden this famous path over the years, along the historic ridgeline above the forests. Some 100,000 walkers come every year to explore this evocative slice of countryside. And deep below your feet a plethora of tunnels carry some of Germany’s most important road and rail routes – including the tubes carrying the brand new Erfurt to Nuremberg high-speed railway.2 The Hochrhoener trail Parts of the Hochrhoener trail extend into Hesse and Bavaria, but its heart lies in Thuringia. Running from Bad Kissingen to Bad Salzungen, via Kreuzberg and the Wasserkuppe mountain, the Hochrhoener trail snakes for 87 miles. It is split into nine stages, if you only want to walk a portion of the longer trail, and crests out at an impressive 876 metres. And if you still feel like you want to go higher, the Hochrhoener is the perfect place for gliding in Thuringia. If you gaze skywards from the paths you can often see gliders catching the currents, which are perfect here due to the geography of the mountains and the way the weather systems work their way through the area. Stargazers can veer off the main path on the Geba trail to discover the “Sternenpark” or Star Park – one of Europe’s leading dark sky landscapes. With platforms and viewing devices provided, it is ideal for gazing into space and spotting stars and planets. And for a taste of history, you can explore the Point Alpha trail leading to the Point Alpha military installations and the remains of the former inner German border – the iron curtain. In this area on the border there’s also Merkers mine – a former salt mine, where the Nazis stashed treasures during the second world war.3 The Thuringian Chain-of-Towns – long-distance cycle trailArchitecture aficionados will love this journey through the buildings and history of Thuringia’s main urban centres. The Chain-of-Towns trail runs for a total of 140 miles, but most of that is over flat to gently sloping ground – so the going is not like pulling teeth. And the route is also perhaps best enjoyed in small portions. Electric bikes are encouraged and regular charging stations pepper the route, plus there are a slew of DB (Deutsche Bahn) railway stations along the way, where you can let the train take the strain if you don’t want to cycle the whole thing. The Chain-of-Towns trail begins in Eisenach, home to the Unesco world heritage site, Wartburg Castle. Next, Gotha and its castle Schloss Friedenstein. Cosmopolitan Erfurt’s student population ensures plenty of bars, and its handsome, historic centre is home to such architectural highlights as the Old Synagogue – one of Europe’s oldest, which is itself home to the famous Erfurt Treasure of gold and silver. Then it’s on to historic Weimar and Jena, and then to Altenburg, where the route concludes.4 Saale cycle route – hills aplentyThose double-wheeled daredevils who look in awe at the Tour de France’s King of the Mountains exploits can find their cycling satisfaction on this challenging and ultimately rewarding run through the heart of the Thuringian hills following the River Saale. Coming in at a thigh-chafing 250 miles, the Saale cycle route calls for plenty of Vaseline in the panniers. The first part of the route from picturesque Fichtelgebirge through the high hills is the most spectacular, and tea breaks can be taken while you marvel at gorges or pristine lakes. As the river widens and flattens, castles and vineyards become more common sights. Bad Sulza’s wineries are especially noted for their bottles of Grüner Veltliner or Muscat Ottonel. Reaching Saalfeld, cyclists or walkers find the mesmerising Fairy Grottoes, listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s most colourful caves. Then, finally, you find peaceful meadows before the river joins the Elbe and flows on its long journey up to Hamburg and the North Sea. Jena is one of Thuringia’s main towns and provides plenty of sleeping, eating and shopping options. Optical innovator Zeiss was founded here and the town’s Zeiss Planetarium is rightly known for its audio and video shows.5 Schwarza Valley Panorama trail – for tree loversFans of forests can revel in this peaceful adventure through the trees that sprout on the eastern side of the Thuringian forest nature park. The park is packed with dense thickets of coniferous trees that provide a habitat for a huge variety of bird and animal species, and you can even forage for wild mushrooms and garlic. This 84-mile trail follows a loop route, starting and finishing in pretty Rudolstadt. Along the way, the trail passes various picture-postcard villages and towns such as Bad Blankenburg, Meuselbach, Altenfeld and Cordobang. The path sometimes rises out from the forest and up into the foothills of the Thuringian Schiefergebirge mountains – whose height and scenic value give the Saxon Switzerland hills, or even the Bavarian mountains, a run for their money. Aside from the obvious arboreal attractions, the Schwarza Valley Panorama trail also passes near to several castles perched on the banks of the River Saale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29183fbc69ae8c99a64004797697aeb9ca67dd87/0_315_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e496846af42c7313821eb685e53f0279","title":"from bach to bauhaus discover the culture of thuringia germany","story":"Immerse yourself in the German artistic gems that changed how we see the worldThuringia is the cultural heart of Germany, a place of inspiration for world-famous artists, writers, musicians and intellectuals. Remarkably, much of Thuringia’s cobbled streets and old stone architecture has barely changed since the time of Bach et al, so as well as touring the many museums devoted to these famous creative and intellectual figures, you have the opportunity to literally walk in their footsteps. Start right here ...Johann Sebastian Bach: baroque brought to lifeGermany’s greatest baroque composer was a jobbing musician throughout his life, and Thuringia is full of traces of his industrious career. Bach was an organist at Arnstadt, but his legacy is celebrated at the annual Thuringian Bach Festival in spring, and Eisenach (where he was born, in 1685) boasts the world’s biggest Bach museum. Housed in a splendid medieval building, the Bach House is devoted to the Bach dynasty – not only Johann Sebastian, but also his numerous musical relatives. The house is full of artefacts from Bach’s life and times, and each visit includes a short concert, played on original baroque-period instruments. If you’re a fan of classical music, you’ll also want to visit the Liszt House in nearby Weimar, where the great Hungarian composer Franz Liszt lived and worked.Martin Luther: the father of ReformationLuther spent his teenage years in Thuringia, first as a schoolboy in Eisenach, and then as a student at the University of Erfurt, graduating with an MA from its faculty of arts. While he was a student, Luther lived in Erfurt’s Augustinian Monastery (open to visitors – you can even stay the night). However, the most spectacular Luther site is Wartburg Castle, near Eisenach, where Luther hid, in disguise, from 1521 to 1522, and translated the New Testament into German – cementing the Reformation and establishing German as a national language. You can visit the room where Luther wrote his meisterwerk, where there used to be an ink stain on the wall – no longer visible – supposedly made when Luther threw an inkpot at the devil, who was trying to distract him.Johann Wolfgang von Goethe: the master of all tradesIt’s hard to overstate quite how important Goethe is to German culture. Poet, playwright, novelist, philosopher and scientist, his genius encompassed virtually every avenue of German intellectual life. Born in Frankfurt in 1749, he came to Thuringia as a young man, fresh from the success of his sensational first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther, and spent time in Erfurt, Jena and Gotha, before settling in Weimar. The baroque house, where he lived for 50 years, until his death in 1832, is now the Goethe National Museum. There are lots of other sites associated with Goethe all over Thuringia, from the Liebhabertheatre in Kochberg Castle to the Botanical Garden in Jena.Lucas Cranach (Elder and Younger): Renaissance father and sonLucas Cranach is one of Germany’s most celebrated painters, and Thuringia is full of paintings by this Renaissance master and his son. Lucas the Elder was the better painter, but his son was almost as good, and their styles are so similar that it’s often hard to tell them apart. Born in 1472, Cranach the Elder settled in Weimar near the end of his life to live with his son’s family, and his adopted hometown is full of mementoes of his life and work. There are plenty of paintings by both Cranachs in Weimar’s Castle Museum, but the crowning glory is the magnificent altarpiece in the Church of St Peter \u0026amp St Paul, started by Cranach the Elder and completed by his son. If you’re travelling around Thuringia, don’t miss the Friedenstein Palace in Gotha and the city’s art museum in Erfurt, which both have fine Cranach collections, and St John’s Church in Neustadt an der Orla, with its precious altarpiece. However, the most atmospheric setting for Cranach’s moody masterpieces is Wartburg Castle, where Cranach’s good friend Martin Luther hid away. The castle contains several acute portraits of Luther by Cranach the Elder, as well as some intimate, perceptive studies of Luther’s parents and his wife.Walter Gropius: founder of BauhausModernist architect Walter Gropius was born in Berlin in 1883, but it was in Thuringia that he made his name. In 1919 in Weimar, he founded the Bauhaus – a revolutionary design school that transformed the way we live today. Gropius taught his students to work across a wide range of disciplines – from pottery to printmaking, and carpentry to ceramics. He taught them to throw out the chintz, to see that less is more. His house style was stark, minimal and, above all, practical. Everything he made was fit for purpose. His ideas have since become commonplace, but in the 1920s they were shocking. In 1925, local conservatives drove him out of Weimar, and when the Nazis came to power he was forced to flee abroad. Yet, here in Thuringia, his influence lives on. Next year, bauhaus museum weimar marks the centenary of the Bauhaus with a move to a smart new building – a fitting forum for the world’s oldest Bauhaus collection. There are plenty of other Bauhaus sites elsewhere in Thuringia, including the Haus Auerbach in Jena, built by Gropius, and a Bauhaus-era hotel, the Haus des Volkes, in Probstzella.Carl Zeiss: a new visionBorn in Weimar in 1816, Zeiss trained as a fine machinist in Thuringia, and in 1846 he opened a workshop in Jena, making telescopes, microscopes and other optical devices. By the time he died, in 1888, his little workshop had grown into a large factory. By the beginning of the first world war, it was the largest camera manufacturer in the world. After the second world war, the Soviets stripped the factory bare, and took much of the equipment back to Russia, but although it ended up behind the iron curtain, Zeiss held its own against western competition – and when Germany was reunified it was one of the few East German firms to survive and prosper as a viable concern. You can learn all about Zeiss at the German Optical Museum in Jena, then visit the nearby Zeiss Planetarium, fitted with state-of-the-art Zeiss telescopes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd65faa3b93e5c08509382c208d06bddb43ec1a/0_1_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe53e88f6e4e7958eddd3c5d549856e","title":"from chocolate to beef roulade the culinary delights of thuringia","story":"The German region may be known for its castles, jaw-dropping landscapes and the famous faces who lived there, but its culinary scene is also something to check out when you visitGerman food is just sausages, isn’t it, and sauerkraut? Well, yes, they do have 1,200 types of wurst – but this is a country with a huge ersity of cuisine, both traditional and contemporary. With more than 200 types of bread, a nationwide passion for vegetables, and an infinite range of regional styles, served everywhere from rural inns to the country’s 300-plus Michelin-starred restaurants, Germany is arguably home to some of the most underrated cuisine in Europe. And the culinary scene in Thuringia is well worth shouting about.So if the state’s erse history, from Martin Luther and Goethe to the Weimar Republic, and spectacularly bucolic landscape, aren’t enough to keep you occupied, Thuringia’s terrific cuisine will certainly ert the attention. A mustard museum in Erfurt and the annual Onion Festival in Weimar (with live music and food stalls, it attracts more than 350,000 people yearly) are proof of how seriously they take their food.The Thuringian bratwurst is the culinary kingpin of the region, but you can tuck in to other hearty dishes such as the succulent Mutzbraten (grilled pork) and Thuringian dumplings, or for those with a sweeter tooth, how about some handmade chocolate? And why not wash it all down with a dark beer, for which the region is well known, or a glass of white wine from Bad Sulza in north-eastern Thuringia? Just a few more reasons why Thuringia should be firmly on the tourist map.Thuringian bratwurstLocals claim the Thuringer rostbratwurst – its full name – is the best bratwurst in Germany. The original recipe dates back to 1434, so they certainly know what they are doing. Consisting of minced pork (local variations have beef or game) mixed with marjoram and garlic, some also feature caraway seed, although its inclusion is a subject of hot debate among Thuringians. It’s traditionally grilled over an open fire and eaten on the street with a bun and mustard (ketchup is a definite faux pas), but having it with sauerkraut and potatoes is also common. Locals consume nearly three times as many bratwursts a year than the average German.Try one from a street stall, or Faust Food, an indoor food market. Still pining for sausages? Then head to the Eichsfeld region in western Thuringia for three types of air-dried sausage: runde, feldkieker (which looks a bit like a club), or the spicy stracke, and you can sample them at the Klausenhof tavern in Bornhagen.Thuringer klösseThe dumpling is a staple dish of the region and traditionally served with a Sunday roast with lots of gravy. Filling and wholesome, the local dumpling doesn’t contain flour and is made of raw grated potatoes and cooked mashed potatoes, seasoned, rolled into fist-sized balls with two or three croutons stuffed inside and then simmered in water. They go well with meat or veg, and were originally popular with the less well-off as they were cheap to make. Try them at Die Landgrafenstube Wartburg Hotel in Eisenach or, for a cheaper alternative, head to Zum Guldenen Rade in Erfurt.MutzbratenA tasty chunk of seasoned pork, which is flame grilled – traditionally over a birchwood fire. It’s served with bread, sauerkraut and mustard. Try one in Schmölln or Altenburg, in the eastern part of the state, where it is something of a speciality, or in an inn or restaurant while walking in the Thuringian Forest.Goldhelm chocolate Inspired chocolate creations are what you will find at Goldhelm Schokolade, which has two outlets in Erfurt. There’s a tiny shop on Krämerbrücke (Merchants’ Bridge), the longest inhabited bridge in Europe – it dates from the 14th century – or there’s a larger version with a lovely cafe on nearby Kreuzgasse. Using high-grade cocoa from Peru and Vietnam allows the makers to lower the sugar content. Their signature chocolate is the Bridge Truffle. They do a memorable hot chocolate too.Beers, wines and spiritsThuringia has a long tradition of brewing beer and producing wine: in the middle ages there were nearly 600 breweries in Erfurt, Germany’s oldest beer purity law was laid down in Weissensee in 1434. The region is known for its dark beers, one of the best is Köstrizter from the little town of Köstritz. Most towns have their own breweries, such as those in Weimar, Eisenach and Erfurt (head here to the Goldener Schwan, which has a wide variety of beers, including wheat and pilsner). Hikers in the Thuringian Forest should visit the Ankerla Brewery in Steinach.Oenophiles will find some fabulous white wines, too – and some very good reds – around Bad Sulza in the north-east one of the best vineyards is Weingut Zahn in Grossheringen, which has a restaurant and tours.And don’t forget to try Thuringia’s range of digestifs, or kräuterschnaps. You will find them in most bars and restaurants – look out for Aromatique, made in Neudietendorf, using spices and herbs Rhöntropfen, produced since the 1870s in the Rhön region and also made with herbs and spices, and Nordhäuser Doppelkorn, a grain brandy from Nordhausen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9425f5b81f3dc73a33d4d83278462aaa4181fd7c/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfbed519ba607a04b1c62249fb1af8ea","title":"fairytale castles and secret forests discover germanys best kept secret","story":"Deep in the heart of Germany lies Thuringia – a state bursting with both cultural curiosities and unrivalled natural beautyExplore the wildernessThe 700-year-old Rennsteig trail traces a spectacular ridgeway through the Thuringian forest, and is a mecca for hikers and cyclists. Originally a trade route in the Middle Ages, the path is popular with both walkers wishing to get away for a while and cyclists up for a serious challenge. With 105 miles running from Bach’s birthplace, Eisenach, to the river Saale in Blankenstein, there is plenty to take in.Medieval wondersStrewn across Thuringia’s lush scenery are an incredible 400 castles and palaces. Queen Victoria, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha famously danced at Schloss Friedenstein, while Richard Wagner’s operatic masterpiece Tannhäuser was inspired by Wartburg Castle, now a Unesco world heritage site and home to a 9,000-strong treasure trove of European art. Erfurt, the state capital, is also worth a visit. Peek inside St Mary’s Cathedral, where the 16th century monk Martin Luther was ordained, before taking in Erfurt’s perfectly preserved medieval old town that’s most impressive.Art and cultureEver since a youthful Johann Wolfgang von Goethe arrived in the city of Weimar, flushed with success from his romantic bestseller The Sorrows of Young Werther, Thuringia has been a haven for artists, philosophers, musicians, innovators and reformers. Weimar’s numerous coffee houses were frequented by everyone from Johann Sebastian Bach to Friedrich Nietzsche, Wassily Kandinsky and Marlene Dietrich. The world-class design school Bauhaus opened in Weimar in 1919 – before moving to Dessau in 1925 – and next year’s centenary will be marked with a plethora of parties and special events, culminating in the grand opening of the new bauhaus museum weimar.Take a different viewPrize for the coolest place to see goes to the Carl Zeiss-Planetarium in Jena.

What is it about some people? Their charm, their grace, their rampant telegenicity … In Nadiya’s case it is something to do with the way emotions chase their way so nakedly over her beautiful face, along with her equally unforced and unaffected verbal eloquence, and the fact that she treats the camera and seemingly every viewer beyond it as a friend she hasn’t met yet. That she, as a young Muslim woman in the public eye, has also functioned as probably the single greatest antidote to the various accumulating toxicities of our age is an unsought side-effect so valuable that it amounts practically to a blessing.Her prominence has come about because of one other gift in her collection: for cooking, which made her the winner three years ago of The Great British Bake Off and the presenter or co-presenter of several one-off programmes and series since. Some have been straightforward cookery shows, but last night’s Nadiya’s Asian Odyssey (BBC One) followed her previous food-based travelogues such as The Chronicles of Nadiya (in which she travelled to Bangladesh to trace her culinary roots) and last year’s Nadiya’s British Food Adventures, where she investigated the edible heritage of the country to which her parents immigrated before her birth.This latest outing will see her travel through Cambodia, Thailand and Nepal, on the ever-so slightly tenuous grounds that a recent DNA test revealed her to have ancestors from there as well as Bangladesh. I understand that everything needs a peg these days, but there was something that sat slightly uneasily here amid the joy that the rest of the programme brought – a vague notion that we need to have some blood connection to people before we can approach or appreciate them, perhaps? It wasn’t much, and perhaps I am being oversensitive, but with a presenter whose USP is unification it felt just a little off.But never mind. After saying goodbye to her equally charming, beautiful and joyful family (with whom I could happily have stayed for the duration), we were away to Cambodia and tumbling through a riot of sights, sounds, colours, flavours, emotions and exotica. She took in Angkor Wat (“I think I just got blessed by accident!” she said after straying too close to a priest’s gathering. “I didn’t even pay for it! Oh, never mind – all God’s work!”), met one of the families who still live in the impoverished villages round the temple and baked Paris-brests at the French pastry school where local girls are encouraged to learn patisserie and make themselves employable. “We have a sad life,” said the mother of one. “I am happy for my daughter to have a better one.”It was a sentiment echoed by the prahok-makers Nadiya met at the Tonlé Sap lakeside (“Our hands itch – I want them to have an easier job”) as she sat with them descaling and filleting in their hundreds the tiny featherback fish that will eventually net the labourers a few dollars a load. The water buffalo she passed reminded her of visiting her Bangladeshi grandad who used to let her take his entire herd down to the river when she was 10. “Imagine!”She prepared palm sugar with a Cambodian grandfather who still climbs up and down 30 trees twice a day to collect sap in wooden cylinders for a dollar a kilo, and a fish curry with the prahok people before heading to Thailand to taste durian, a pad thai to end all pad thai (her own attempts were greeted with polite disdain that she assured us was as nothing compared with the straight-talking she was used to from her own extended family) and insects. “They will be the last source of protein for humans,” said the restaurant’s chef – I want to say, encouragingly – as Nadiya briefly hesitated in the face(s) of cricket nachos, bamboo caterpillars, ant caviar and silkworm snacks.The whole thing was a joy, made only more so in a strange way by the admission of truths. Picturesque ways of life are hard. Ours aren’t sustainable. Not all dishes work, but sharing food, sharing cultures and approaching them with an equally hearty appetite always will. Nadiya’s Asian Odyssey is only two parts, a quarter of the length of her journey around Britain, but were it twice as long I suspect I would still be hungry for more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d01149191c8d8ffa36882d17c36720b6a087bfa/0_166_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b06232471ef4e62613a97aa9b426044","title":"george hw bush casket washington","story":"His face etched with grief, former president George W Bush watched on Monday as his father’s flag-draped coffin was placed on the Lincoln catafalque to lie in state at the US Capitol in Washington.The 43rd president, now a son in mourning, blinked hard as George HW Bush’s casket was carried into the Capitol rotunda at sunset by uniformed officers. His wife, Laura, kept her arm linked through his for most of the 40-minute ceremony.Bush died last Friday at the age of 94. He was the longest-lived president in American history and the last of the second world war generation.The Bush family gathered in the Capitol rotunda, replete with statues of Bush’s Republican contemporaries, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, and surrounded by diplomats and members of Donald Trump’s administration, the US Congress, the military and the supreme court, including Justice Clarence Thomas, a controversial Bush nominee.Trump, whose populist, insult-laden brand of politics has inevitably drawn comparisons with the patrician Bush, who called for a “kinder, gentler” America, was not at the ceremony.But he and first lady Melania Trump came to the Capitol later Monday to pay tribute. They stood in front of the casket with their eyes closed for a few moments, before Trump saluted the casket.Trump also plans to attend the funeral on Wednesday, a national day of mourning.The presence of leading Democrats including Nancy Pelosi, who embraced George W Bush, Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker, and the Washington mayor Muriel Bowser, ensured a bipartisan comity for a man whose death has prompted a temporary ceasefire in Washington’s politics of rancour and ision.But as the 1988 election campaign proved, Bush could take the gloves off when fighting for the conservative cause. The three speakers at Monday’s ceremony were all Republicans.The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, recalled that Bush was just a teenager when he volunteered for military service and became the navy’s youngest aviator. He was only 20 in 1944 when his plane was hit on a bombing run but, through the fire and smoke, he stayed steady at the controls. “A steady hand, staying the course. That’s what George Bush gave us for decades.”The House speaker, Paul Ryan, told the somber gathering under the Capitol dome: “Throughout his life of service, President Bush personified grace. His character was second to none.”When Ryan spoke of an image of Bush as “a loving father” reaching out to hold his son’s hand at the National Cathedral after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, George W Bush was moved to say “yes”.The speaker added: “He showed us that how we live is as important as what we achieve. His life was a hymn of honour. His legacy is grace perfected. His memory will belong to glory.” George W Bush warmly shook the speaker’s hand as he went past to sit down.Vice-President Mike Pence recalled entering politics at 29 and meeting Bush, who was then vice-president himself. “Then, as always, I was struck by his approachability,” Pence said. “There was a kindness about the man that was evident to everyone who ever met him. All his years in public service were characterised by kindness, modesty and patriotism.Pence became emotional has he told how, in August this year, Bush had sent a handwritten letter to his own son after he made his first “tailhook landing” as a marine aviator on the USS George Herbert Walker Bush. “In that letter, President Bush wrote to my son in his words, ‘Congratulations on receiving your wings of gold. I know how proud you and your family are at this moment.’”George W Bush smiled at Pence after his remarks but did not shake his hand as the vice-president sat down beside him. Leaders from both parties them laid wreaths beside the casket, which sits atop a catafalque first used for Abraham Lincoln’s 1865 funeral, before the rotunda was opened to the public until Wednesday.The casket had arrived in Washington on Monday afternoon from Texas, aboard the US military plane known as Air Force One when the serving president is aboard, after a 21-gun salute.The crew, who flew the plane to Houston on Sunday, were tasked with carrying out “Special Air Mission 41”, the number a reference to Bush’s place in the roster of America’s presidents.The casket was accompanied from Texas to Joint Base Andrews near the capital by George W Bush his wife, Laura and the younger George’s brother Neil and his family. Trump has ordered the federal government closed on Wednesday for the national day of mourning. Flags on public buildings are flying at half-staff for 30 days.Trump has not always uttered kind words about the Bush family. But he offered lavish praise after the former president’s death was announced.“He was just a high-quality man who truly loved his family,” Trump said on Saturday while in Argentina for the G20 summit. “One thing that came through loud and clear, he was very proud of his family and very much loved his family. So he was a terrific guy and he’ll be missed.”Bush’s death reduces the ex-presidents’ club to four: Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. He was denied a second term by Clinton, who would later become a close friend. Writing for the Washington Post on Saturday, Clinton declared of Bush: “I just loved him.”Carter, at 94 the oldest living ex-president – born a few months after Bush – confirmed he would attend the Washington funeral. Clinton and Obama are also expected to be present.CNN reported on Monday that Trump would not speak at the funeral, but would meet Bush family members privately.Bush’s body will then be returned to Houston. He will be buried – wearing socks featuring jets flying in formation – on Thursday at his family plot on the library grounds at Texas A\u0026ampM University. His final resting place will be alongside Barbara Bush, his wife of 73 years, who died in April at the age of 92, and Robin Bush, the daughter they lost to leukemia in 1953 at age three."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a58da484fa1f01708e4e57c2d026793655dba01e/45_0_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82e180fcbae89c534c0ba78c3cd3885d","title":"who are the gilets jaunes and what do they want","story":"What began as a fuel tax protest by French drivers now appeals to wider anti-government sentiment A grassroots citizens’ protest movement began in early November against a planned rise in the tax on diesel and petrol, which Emmanuel Macron insisted would aid the country’s transition to green energy. A poll at the time found that the price of fuel had become France’s biggest talking point.The movement was named “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests) because protesters wear the fluorescent yellow high-vis jackets that all motorists must by law carry in their cars. But what began as a fuel tax protest has now morphed into a wider anti-government movement.Unlike previous French protest movements, it sprang up online through petitions and was organised by ordinary working people posting videos on social media, without a set leader, trade union or political party behind it.A first national day of protests was held across France on Saturday 17 November and the protests have continued daily, including roadblocks, barricades of roundabouts and the blockading of fuel depots.The French interior ministry says the total number of people demonstrating has dropped since its peak on 17 November, when about 285,000 people demonstrated across France. On 1 December, two weeks after the first protests, the interior ministry said that at 3pm 75,000 people were on the streets. It is thought that about 100,000 in total demonstrated in France throughout the day.However, violence has escalated at the weekly Paris protests held on Saturdays. While thousands demonstrated peacefully on 1 December, about 3,000 people fought running battles with police, burned more than 100 cars, set fire to several buildings and smashed bank windows and shopfronts on some of the most expensive streets in the capital.Authorities blamed extreme-right and extreme-left “professional” rioters for infiltrating the peaceful demonstrations. The Paris prosecutor said a majority of the more than 300 people in police custody after the Paris violence were men aged between 30 and 40 who “had come to fight police while also claiming to be part of the gilets jaunes movement”.There were also violent clashes with police in Toulouse. In Le Puy-en-Velay, the local prefect’s office was petrol-bombed and briefly caught fire.Gilets jaunes protesters in other regions continue to stage roadblocks, and some fuel depots have been blocked in the north-west. Some high-school students have also now joined the movement and barricaded schools.Protesters have largely come from peripheral towns, cities and rural areas across France and include many women and single mothers. Most of the protesters have jobs, including as secretaries, IT workers, factory workers, delivery workers and care workers. All say their low incomes mean they cannot make ends meet at the end of the month.The movement is predominantly against a tax system perceived as unfair and unjust, but there are numerous grievances and differences of opinion. Most want to scrap the fuel taxes, hold a review of the tax system, raise the minimum wage and roll back Macron’s tax cuts for the wealthy and his pro-business economic programme. But some also want parliament dissolved and Macron to resign.This is the first big crisis of Macron’s presidency. The 40-year-old pro-business, pro-Europe centrist has staked his political identity on insisting he would never give in to street protests. But polls suggest he is seen as not listening to the concerns of ordinary working people on low incomes, and he is under pressure to make concessions.It is damaging that Macron – whose own fledgling political movement, La République En Marche, was styled as a grassroots movement to listen to the people – was taken by surprise by this sudden tax revolt. Although Macron beat the far-right Marine Le Pen in last year’s presidential election, the mood of distrust of the political class never went away.The question is what Macron could now offer to calm the protests and whether he now tweaks his economic policy. The first 18 months of Macron’s presidency were defined by his drive for businesses to become more competitive he has cut taxes on companies and transformed France’s wealth tax, easing the tax burden on the very wealthy.Macron is now under pressure to consider the gilets jaunes’ demands, which include scrapping the eco tax and raising the minimum wage. It is uncertain what measures the government might propose in the coming days. The economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, said on Monday that the government should press on with lowering taxes but at the same time lower France’s high public spending.AnalysisWarnings of latest crisis facing Macron were in plain sightAre the French hit especially hard by fuel taxes?OpinionNever before have I seen blind anger like this on the streets of ParisFrance is deeply fractured.

The members are nominated every three years and it is unusual for their mandates to be cut short.Grillo did not explain the motive behind her decision and said in her post that some of the revoked board members “could be reappointed”, but “not the leaders … who must have the trust of and be in full harmony with the minister in charge”.Siliquini said Grillo had the power to sack the board, but it was unusual. “It’s also unusual that in her communication she said some can remain but not the leaders … she doesn’t name me but it’s simple to understand,” Siliquini said.Siliquini, who received a formal letter of her dismissal on Monday morning that contained no explanation, said that in the six months since Grillo became health minister the pair never met.“We’re the organisation that helps them, from a scientific and technical point of view, to make decisions on policy,” said Siliquini. “But she never asked us anything during these six months, which was probably a strong signal.”In 2013 the Five Star Movement was a vociferous supporter of Stamina, a controversial stem-cell therapy promoted by a psychologist who claimed it could perform miracles but was later proven to be a con.Grillo has also caused confusion after making several U-turns on the government’s child vaccine policy. Her party, which is government in coalition with the far-right League, came to power pledging to reform a policy brought in by the previous administration making 10 vaccines mandatory.Grillo then said in June that parents could “self-certify” that their children had been vaccinated, instead of providing a doctor’s note, causing mayhem at the start of the school year. Then in mid-November, amid a measles epidemic, the government said it would uphold the vaccines obligation while calling for 800,000 infants, children and young adults to be injected against the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8124f57137e39445a0e7fce1ce170710b72cbac5/76_280_3424_2054/master/3424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd0fa0d0b57d7c4238cb44386c8be2f","title":"the aftermath of the gilets jaunes riots in paris in pictures","story":"Vandalised cars and graffiti on the streets of central Paris, after a day of clashes between riot police and gilets jaunes protesters, who are demonstrating against rising oil prices and living costs• Paris riots: Macron to hold emergency meeting after worst unrest in decade"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718774.1543861309!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"class gap exposed in third level progression figures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUniversity of Limerick: Outside Dublin, proximity to a third-level college and socio-economic status seemed to be key determining factors in whether or not students go on to third level. Photograph: iStockStudents from the most affluent parts of Dublin are up to 14 times more likely to progress to university than their counterparts from some schools in the city’s most disadvantaged areas, the annual  “Feeder Schools” supplement shows. The survey reveals that most schools in better-off parts of the city – such as Dublin 2, 4 and 6 and 14 – had progression rates of 90 per cent or more. By contrast, inidual schools in more deprived parts of the capital – such as Dublin 10, 11, 17 and 24 – had progression rates as low as 7 per cent.These figures indicate both the extent of middle-class privilege and the inequality that continues to pervade the education system despite decades of investment in deprived schools.A breakdown of figures nationally also shows that schools in the State’s most privileged areas are sending the highest number of students to university and these are taking high-points courses.Fee-paying schools continue to dominate Feeder School league tables, accounting for 17 of the top 20 schools that send the most students to college.Muckross College, a non-fee-paying all-girls school in Donnybrook, Dublin 4, had the single highest progression rate to university and high-points courses.This was closely followed by Coláiste Iosagáin, a non-fee-paying all-girls Gaelscoil in Blackrock, Dublin 4, and Sandford Park, an inter-denominational fee-paying school in Ranelagh, Dublin 6.All these schools recorded college progression rates in excess of 100 per cent. This is because students who defer college, or who repeat a year, are recorded in the same data that is compiled by third-level colleges.Disadvantaged, or Deis, schools recorded average progression figures of 57 per cent. This overall rate has not changed significantly over the past five years.Outside Dublin, proximity to a third-level college and socio-economic status seemed to be key determining factors in whether or not students go on to third level. In Galway, an average of 84 per cent of students go on to third level, with an average of 79 per cent in Cork city and county, 76 per cent in Kildare. By contrast, there were much lower progression rates in Longford (61 per cent) and Sligo (64 per cent). Schools which teach through Irish also continue to outperform many other schools with progress rates of just over 80 per cent. While they account for just 48 of the 700-plus secondary schools – about 7 per cent – they accounted for eight of the top 25 schools with the highest college progression rates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3718748.1543859255!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"feeder schools five take aways from this year s figures","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe proportion of school leavers heading to college is now edging towards 60 per cent. Photograph: iStockThe  Feeder School data published on Tuesday provides details of the educational pathways of thousands of students across almost 700 secondary schools this year.We can see the patterns of where students went on to third level and in what numbers.They do not show where students went on to further education or apprenticeships we have consistently requested this data but education authorities have not yet released it.Notwithstanding that, this year’s figures provide some striking insights into areas such as the importance of social class and geography in determining the paths of many thousands of pupils. Here are some of the key points from this year’s data: The data reveals the ongoing good news story of Ireland’s exceptionally high third-level participation rates, putting us among the highest in the world for those under 40 years of age.The proportion of school leavers heading to college is now edging towards 60 per cent.By contrast, the equivalent proportion in countries such as Germany is less than half this figure.Ireland also continues to have one of the highest retention rates in second level across Europe: that is the proportion of students who stay in school until the Leaving Cert.Within the feeder school figures are stark differences in college participation based on social class.The most affluent parts of the capital – such as Dublin 2, Dublin 6 and Dublin 4 – saw 90-100 per cent of pupils go on to college.By contrast, more deprived areas of the city such as Dublin 17 has a progression rate of just 7 per cent (though this may be distorted by a single secondary school in the area). Dublin 10 and and Dublin 11 also had relatively low progression rates of 42-44 per cent.The ide is also stark when the figures are broken down into higher points courses, which are defined as programmes in universities, colleges of education, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) or the Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT).Some 80 per cent of school leavers in Dublin 6 went on to one of these institutions, compared with 4 per cent in Dublin 17 and 16 per cent in Dublin 10.Irish young people are tending to apply for third-level places in their local colleges. This is partly cultural as most Irish school leavers want to attend colleges where they can continue to socialise with their peer group. But there is a growing economic factor too: living away from home adds hugely to the cost of attending college. This is especially true for students considering Dublin, Cork or Galway for college given the accommodation crisis.A breakdown of figures on a county basis also show there are lower progression rates in counties which do not have a large third-level institution on their doorstep.In Longford, for example, 61 per cent of school leavers went to college in Galway – home to NUI Galway and GMIT – the equivalent figure was 84 per cent. 4. Affluence, rather than private schools, is a key factorMost of the schools where all students progress to third level are fee paying, but the fees are not the determinate factor.Non-fee-paying schools in the same geographic areas draw their pupils from the same social class and achieve similar participation rates. For example, the top two schools in percentage participation rates in higher points courses are Muckross College Donnybrook, and Coláiste Íosagáin Stillorgan Road, both non-fee paying schools.5. Some Deis schools performing well Schools which are designated as disadvantaged – or Deis – receive extra resources. Overall, about 57 per cent of pupils in these colleges go on to higher education.These rates have not shifted much since 2012, according to our figures.When we break down the figures to see who are the “most improved” schools over recent years, however, a great deal of schools are in the Deis category.For example, Scoil Chuimsitheach Chiaráin, a co-educational Deis school in Connemara, has seen its third-level participation rate increase from 60 per cent in 2012, to 97 per cent in 2018. These figures can, however, be distorted sometimes by falling student numbers, or pupils leaving school early, which push progression rates – temporarily – upwards.This shows the scale of challenge for both the schools involved and the Government."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Olivia Buckley expected to fill slot left by decision of Justin McAleese to not runLiving peatlands sequester carbon-dioxide, drawing it down from the atmosphere through plants and trapping it underground as carbonConcerns over contract price remain but officials say price would be spread out over 25 yearsDozens of doctors walked out of event claiming \u0026lsquoserious crisis\u0026rsquo over abortion servicesMove comes as party prepares to decide on confidence and supply deal extensionAmount language school owed in directors\u0026rsquo loans rose from \u0026euro153,586 to \u0026euro427,419 in 2017Peter Boylan says \u0026lsquoinevitably, there will be problems\u0026rsquo and nobody should expect \u0026lsquoperfection\u0026rsquo from serviceAdequate supports not available to teenagers entering direct provision system, says ESRIEducational inequality: \u0026lsquoFeeder Schools\u0026rsquo data shows the extent of two-tier schools systemSchools with dramatically falling numbers can have grossly inflated progression ratesWhy do some schools send more students on to third-level institutions than others?DUP describes Sinn F\u0026eacutein as \u0026lsquolittle more than glorified spectators\u0026rsquo in Brexit debateFurther education expanding to offer apprenticeship and traineeship programmes in finance and ITSchool figures also account for all students who sat the Leaving Cert in previous yearsLists should be considered alongside whole-school evaluations and subject inspection reportsNSPCC Northern Ireland says it received 19,937 calls last year about neglect of childrenSchool profile: St Eunan\u0026rsquos College, Co DonegalSchools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit teachers.

It will protect vital jobs and investment, and allow businesses in Northern Ireland to seize upon new opportunities as we strike new trade deals around the world,” she said.“Crucially it is a deal that protects the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom, ” added Ms Bradley.Meanwhile, the DUP’s East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson has accused Sinn Féin’s seven abstentionist MPs of being “little more than glorified spectators on the sidelines” in the Brexit debates.“Their seven MPs could wield influence in the House of Commons but instead they choose to take their money but boycott the chamber. They fail those seven constituencies,” he said on Monday.“Sinn Féin’s newfound energy regarding the European Union was almost nonexistent during the actual EU referendum campaign in 2016.”He said the DUP opposes the withdrawal agreement because it is bad for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.“Northern Ireland would be locked into taking rules from Brussels with no democratic say on those rules. Indeed, over time our rules and regulations would erge away from the rest of the United Kingdom, our main market,” he said.Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill said the DUP was “clearly on the wrong side” of the debate. “They are setting their face against the wishes and best interests of the vast majority of citizens by continuing to push for a hard Brexit and opposing the withdrawal agreement,” she said.“That agreement is not perfect and neither is the backstop contained within it. However, it is the least worst option and remains our best insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit on the island of Ireland,” said Ms O’Neill.“Whatever transpires over the coming weeks, the backstop remains the bottom line.”The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said it was “reckless” for anyone to say that there is an alternative to the backstop. “There is not,” he said. “A rejection of this deal on the basis of the backstop will only bring us back to square one. No matter what happens next week in the House of Commons the backstop is non-negotiable.”Former Ulster Unionist Party leader Lord Reginald Empey said the DUP was “asleep at the wheel a year ago when they could have done something” to strike a better post-Brexit deal.“They squandered the time by telling us all how influential they were in London and allowed Dublin to run rings around them. This is one awful mess and the DUP must take their share of the responsibility for it,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Alan BetsonThe officials were keen to stress that it was “all systems go” in the wake of the Peter Smyth report last week, according to sources present, and there was an expectation that they will recommend acceptance of the bid to the Government.Mr Smyth’s report, commissioned in the wake of the resignation of former minister for communications Denis Naughten over private meetings with David McCourt, who is fronting the sole bid for the rural broadband contract, concluded that the process had not been fatally undermined by the contacts.Government sources said they expected officials in the department would complete their report either shortly before or after Christmas, after which Minister Richard Bruton would bring a recommendation to Government for approval to proceed with the contract. While significant concerns over the price of the contract remain – with some senior Government sources believing that the ultimate cost could be as high as €3 billion – the officials said the price would be paid out over a 25-year period.However, sources with knowledge of the discussions say there will not be further negotiations on the price of the contract. As the Smyth report shows, the department had significant concerns on the price sought by bidders Granahan McCourt, and Mr Naughten attended a meeting with the bidders to warn Mr McCourt that he would not recommend acceptance by the Government of the price the bidders were gearing up to ask for. However, Mr Naughten also said he was desperate to keep the McCourt consortium in the process after the departure of all the other bidders.One source said the proposal brought to Government – assuming it is approved by the department – will include the level of subsidy proposed for the project.The Dáil is expected to discuss the broadband issue when it hears statements on the Smyth report on Tuesday evening. Reports at the weekend suggested Mr Naughten believed he should return to the Cabinet as he had been exonerated by the report. However, sources said there was little chance of this happening. The Taoiseach’s official spokesman said last week the report represented “a partial or qualified vindication” of Mr Naughten.

Video: BBCReuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May leaves Downing Street in the rain on Monday to address the House of Commons. Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTheresa May will on Tuesday appeal to MPs to back her Brexit deal at the start of five days of debate on the agreement, which is opposed by much of her own party as well as by the opposition. The prime minister will say that the deal respects the outcome of the 2016 referendum and will return to Britain control of its borders, laws and money.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum and allows us to come together again as a country, whichever way we voted. This is the deal that delivers for the British people,” she is expected to say.Attorney general Geoffrey Cox told MPs on Monday that Britain would have to remain indefinitely in the Northern Ireland backstop if negotiations failed to produce a free-trade deal that kept the Border open. Mr Cox was speaking after the publication of an overview of his legal advice to the government on Brexit, which followed a demand by MPs that they should see his full advice to the cabinet.“I make no bones about it, I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination of this backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit if negotiations have irretrievably broken down. But I am prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we are likely to be entrapped in it permanently,” Mr Cox said.The attorney general said that the backstop would offer Northern Ireland’s traders a competitive advantage over traders from European Union member states, including Ireland, because they could trade freely in both the single market and the rest of the UK. He suggested that, if the backstop persisted beyond a short period, it would be subject to a legal challenge in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that article 50 of the EU treaty could not be the basis of a permanent arrangement with a non-EU state.Dozens of Conservative MPs have said publicly that they would vote against the withdrawal agreement, along with the DUP and the opposition parties. But Mr Cox said that, when weighed against the alternatives to backing the prime minister’s deal, it was a risk worth taking.“This represents a sensible compromise. It has unattractive elements, unsatisfactory elements for us. But the question for the House is to weigh it up against the other potential alternatives and to assess whether it amounts to a calculated risk that this government and this House should take in these circumstances,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate.” Photograph: Brendan SmialowskiAFPGetty ImagesToronto: the snow is falling lightly.I’m feeling something foreign, something I’ve never felt before. It takes me a moment to identify it.I’m feeling sorry for the Clintons.In the 27 years I’ve covered Bill and Hillary, I’ve experienced a range of emotions. They’ve dazzled me and they’ve disgusted me.But now they’re mystifying me.I’m looking around Scotiabank Arena, the home of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and it’s a depressing sight. It’s two-for-the-price-of-one in half the arena. The hockey rink is half curtained off, but even with that, organisers are scrambling at the last minute to cordon off more sections behind thick black curtains, they say due to a lack of sales. I paid $177 weeks in advance. (I passed on the pricey meet-and-greet option.) On the day of the event, some unsold tickets are slashed to single digits.I get reassigned to another section as the Clintons’ audience space shrinks. But even with all the herding, I’m still looking at large swathes of empty seats – and I cringe at the thought that the Clintons will look out and see that, too. It was only four years ago, after all, that Canadians were clamouring to buy tickets to see the woman who seemed headed for history.It’s a sad contrast with the sold-out boffo book tour of Michelle Obama, who’s getting a lot more personal for the premium prices. But introspection has never been within the Clintons’ range.I can’t fathom why the Clintons would make like ageing rock stars and go on a tour of Canada and the United States at a moment when Democrats are hoping to break the stranglehold of their cloistered, superannuated leadership and exult in a mosaic of exciting new faces.What is the point? It’s not inspirational. It’s not for charity. They’re not raising awareness about a cause, like Al Gore with global warming. They’re only raising awareness about the Clintons.It can’t be the money at this point. Have they even spent all the Goldman gold yet? Do they want to swim in their cash like Scrooge McDuck?The Clintons’ tin cup is worthy of the Smithsonian. They hoovered more than $2 billion in contributions to their campaigns, foundation and philanthropies.After the White House, the money-grubbing raged on, with the Clintons making more than 700 speeches in a 15-year period, blithely unconcerned with any appearance of avarice or of shady special interests and foreign countries buying influence. They stockpiled a whopping $240 million. Even leading up to her 2016 presidential run, Hillary was packing in the speeches, talking to the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, the American Camp Association, eBay, and there was that infamous trifecta of speeches for Goldman Sachs worth $675,000.“What scares me the most is Hillary’s smug certainty of her own virtue as she has become greedy and how typical that is of so many chic liberals who seem unaware of their own greed,” Charlie Peters, the legendary liberal former editor of the Washington Monthly, told me. “They don’t really face the complicity of what’s happened to the world, how selfish we’ve become and the horrible damage of screwing the workers and causing this resentment that the Republicans found a way of tapping into.” He ruefully worries about the Obamas in this regard, too.Indeed, in the era of Trump, greed is not only good. It’s grand. The stock market is our highest value. Mammonism rules.But watching the Clintons hash over their well-worn tale of falling in love at Yale Law School, I realise that it’s not only about the money.Some in Clintonworld say Hillary fully intends to be the nominee. Once more, in Toronto, she didn’t rule it out, dodging the question with a lame joke. She carries herself with the air of a president in exile. Her consigliere, Philippe Reines, has prodded reporters on including her name when they write about 2020 candidates.And Bill has given monologues to old friends about how Hillary knows how she’d have to run in 2020, that she couldn’t have a big staff and would just speak her mind and not focus-group everything. (That already sounds focus-grouped.)After losing to an orange puffer clown fish who will go down as one of the most destructive forces in American history and flushing the Obama legacy down the drain, that’s delusional. Some Obama associates say the former president has some regrets about throwing his support solely behind Hillary and knows he misread the anger and frustration of voters.Bill was radioactive in the midterms and Hillary was the Ghost of Christmas Past. Her approval rating is at a record low of 36 per cent. The only American who seems truly interested in her these days is president Donald Trump, who can’t stop tweeting about her. She’s still money in his book.The Clintons refuse to be discarded. It has been their joint project for half a century to be at the centre of the public scene and debate. The way that the whole thing came crashing down in 2016 is too hard for them to bear. They would like to rewrite the ending, but there is no way to do that.Nothing they have done lately suggests that they have learned anything, including their obtuse post-#MeToo comments about Monica Lewinsky, who has been far more candid and sympathetic in the 20th anniversary retellings of the impeachment saga. The Clintons are still unable to hold themselves accountable. The formerly golden couple who dominated their party for nearly three decades is travelling North America in a bubble, shockingly un-self-aware.Their pathological need to be relevant in America is belied by a Canadian arena, where stretches of empty seats bear witness to the passing of their relevance.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

it’s such a big deal to go in and ask for things like contraceptives and menstrual products,” Joanna Bichsel, CEO and co-founder of Kasha, told The . “We want to change the way women, especially in developing countries, are able to access health products.”Established only two and a half years ago in Rwanda, the company has recently launched in Kenya. It allows thousands of women to order affordably priced products - from sanitary pads and condoms to shampoos and body lotions - on their mobile phones. Customers can order online, or those without smartphones can dial *119 to use an offline, text message based version to make purchases. The orders are then dispatched and delivered to their door in discreet packaging by moped or, in particularly remote regions, a local Kasha ‘agent’. Access to contraception“There was absolutely a gap in technology serving women and women’s needs,” said Joanna, who started the company with business partner Amanda Arch after leaving the Seattle tech bubble. “We have an e-commerce model, but we have chosen to optimise for women and underserved consumers.The approach appears to be working Kasha delivered its 100,000th order this month and has close to 20,000 customers. Products which are seen as \u0027embarrassing\u0027 to purchase in shops - including sanitary pads, condoms, HIV tests and emergency contraception - have been the most popular purchases. “We serve women across segments, from low income women in rural communities to executive women in offices,” said Dianne Dusaidi, Rwanda country director. “We’ve actually been surprised with how popular we’ve been with rural areas, we thought Kasha might just appeal to the middle classes.”Contraception use has skyrocketed in Rwanda, but stigma remainsCentral to the company\u0027s appeal is what it calls the Kasha ladies. Built on an Avon-style model, the company employs 75 women who work in predominantly rural communities, to build trust with clients and explain how e-commerce - still in its infancy in Rwanda - works. “The majority of our agents are widows, single mothers or breadwinners,” said Malyse Uwase, regional health and impact manager. “We look for women who are motivated and trusted in their community, who can talk through products and help people through the ordering process. They’re the face of Kasha.” Kasha received funding from the UK’s Department of International Development (DfID) and Unilever’s Transform programme to get started, but hopes to be profitable and self sufficient by early 2020 - and to expand across the developing world.Kasha was built to be global, said Joanna. More people should be watching the \u0027femtech\u0027 space, it has the potential to revolutionise women’s health.” Newsletter promotion -

And then update them again.Early next year, the company should release an update that brings a wireless charging case that allows them to power up just by being placed onto a wireless charging mat. It might also bring other changes, such as improved connectivity, an improved hinge on the door that clicks open and lets the earphones out\u0026nbspand new features, leaks suggested.That\u0027s according to a report from usually reliably analyst Ming-Chi\u0026nbspKuo, who reports that none of the new earphones will be ready for this Christmas season.Then a year later, in early 2020, the company will bring an all-new design. He did not reveal what those would look like, but previous rumours have suggested that waterproofing and always-on hey Siri could be on their way.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesThe report made no mention of AirPower, the wireless charging mat that was first announced more than a year ago and has mostly disappeared in the time since. The wirelessly charging AirPods and the charging mat had been announced together, with the new case expected in part so that the AirPods\u0026nbspcould be used on the mat alongside other Apple products.Apple has not commented on a possible release date for the AirPower\u0026nbspmat. Rumours have suggested that the company might be struggling to make the technology work, and some have suggested that it might be dropped entirely.The company had even showed off what appeared to be the new AirPods\u0026nbspcase alongside its charging mat, suggesting that both would be coming soon. It\u0027s not clear if the two products\u0027 delays are related.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

England’s success at the World Cup and good weather undoubtedly helped.“The chancellor’s\u0026nbspdecision in the Budget to freeze beer tax and lower business rates for thousands of pubs will make a huge difference to the viability of the sector moving forward, but Brexit looms large though, and brewers and publicans alike need certainty.”He added: “Clarity on the transition period from 29 March onwards, and a strong steer on the future relationship with the EU, would be a boost to the trade and beer sales. A no-deal Brexit should be avoided at all costs.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That’s why the best solution, for the country and the politicians who will be asking for our vote sooner, is to act decisively and support our call for a vote on the deal, before it’s too late.”National Union of StudentsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Launching the strategy, May confirmed English GPs will be able to refer lonely people to community and voluntary activities by 2023, as she paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her deathShe added: “At a time when all school are desperately short of funds, finding £50m for grammar schools is unfair and unjust.“Grammar schools create social and educational segregation with schools in surrounding areas left to educate higher numbers of middle and lower attaining pupils, and a disproportionate number of pupils with special educational needs.”But the government has said that the existing grammar schools have been selected based on their action plans to improve access for disadvantaged children.\u0026nbspMore than half of the schools have committed to lowering the mark required to pass the entrance test for poorer pupils.Education secretary Damian Hinds said: “One of the standout features of this country’s education system is its ersity, and selective schools are an important part of that.\u0026nbspThey include some of the best schools in this country, with almost all selective schools rated Good or Outstanding, and they are popular with parents.“So it is right that when there is need for more places in an area, these schools should be able to expand – as other schools can – to enable as many children as possible to benefit.”He added: “I have always been clear that selective schools will only be able to expand if they meet the high bar we have set for increasing access for disadvantaged children, and all of these schools have done that.\u0026nbspAs a result, countless more children from disadvantaged areas will benefit from places at outstanding schools.”Julie\u0026nbspMcCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We would rather see the money spent on creating places in non-selective schools as we believe this is the most effective way of\u0026nbspbenefiting\u0026nbsppupils from all backgrounds.“There are many excellent non-selective schools in which children of all abilities thrive.”Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (Trafford)Bournemouth School for Girls (Bournemouth)Department for EducationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Monday afternoon, the expiration date was no longer visible on the streamer\u0027s website, suggesting it could have been the result of a technical glitch.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Netflix for more information.While Netflix US has yet to officially comment on the matter, some sources appeared to confirm that the show was here to stay.NBC\u0026nbspnews senior editor Claire Atkinson said she had asked Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos about a possible removal, adding that\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspwouldn\u0027t be taken down in January.Wall Street Journal\u0026nbspmedia reporter Joe Flint tweeted that the date seemed to have been a mistake and that the sitcom wasn\u0027t going anywhere yet.Friends\u0026nbsparrived on Netflix UK in January 2018, three years after making its debut on Netflix US.Some such as media analyst Rich Greenfield of BTIG\u0026nbsphave suggested that\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspmight leave netflix as WarnerMedia, the parent company of Warner Bros, gets ready to launch its own streaming platform.Warner Bros Television is the distribution company through which\u0026nbspFriends\u0026nbspis made available.Created with Sketch.The 25 best TV shows on Netflix UK Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).“Content like Friends is likely to disappear from Netflix in 2019 as WarnerMedia launches its own SVOD service,”\u0026nbspGreenfield wrote in October in a note transcribed in part by Deadline.“As more content creators launch their own SVOD services, how should investors think about the impact of losing high-profile syndicated content?”WarnerMedia\u0027s streaming service is slated to launch in 2019.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Launching the strategy, May confirmed English GPs will be able to refer lonely people to community and voluntary activities by 2023, as she paid tribute to murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who had campaigned to end loneliness before her deathDr Harley added: “This is important because we know that the age at which puberty starts in girls has been getting earlier in the last few decades one hypothesis is that chemicals in the environment might be playing a role, and our findings support this idea.“Earlier puberty in girls increases their risk of mental health problems and risk-taking behaviour as teenagers and increases their risk of breast and ovarian cancer over the long-term, so this is an important issue to address.”Pesticides could wipe out frogs by turning them female, study findsHowever the report found no impact on puberty in boys. While it is not possible to say that the rising chemical levels caused this early puberty onset, rather than some other unmeasured variable that is associated with these chemical levels, experts said the study was otherwise well conducted and could be important for\u0026nbsppublic health policy makers.”The age of puberty has been advancing over the years and other factors such as ethnicity are also important contributors. The other main theory put forward for earlier onset of puberty is an increased prevalence of overweight and obese children,” said Dr Ali\u0026nbspAbbara, clinical senior lecturer in endocrinology at Imperial College London who was not involved in the research.“Generally limiting unnecessary exposure of chemicals if avoidable is sensible to avoid potential harm, however in practice this may difficult to do as they are so ubiquitously present.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

That should allow people to share more personal moments with a smaller group, Instagram said.Instagram Stories has become the place to express yourself and share everyday moments, but our community has grown — sometimes what you want to share isn\u0027t for everyone, the company wrote in its announcement blog post.Instagram’s latest feature aims to tackle social media addictionInstagram had always intended for stories to be a more personal way of sharing information on the site. Not only do they disappear 24 hours after they are posted, users can see everyone who has watched them.Adding people to the list of close friends is simple: go to your profile and click on the Close Friends option in the side menu and add people. Then when you share a new story, you\u0027ll have the option of sharing only with the people in that list.Only you can see your own close friends list, people will not know from the app if they are not in it, and there is no way for people to ask to be added.\u0026nbspIf you are chosen as someone\u0027s close friend, you will see a green ring badge when you\u0027re viewing their stories, and a green ring around their profile photo in the list of stories.Close friends will be rolling out globally today on both iOS and Android, the company said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Mr Ashley told politicians on the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee that most high streets are beyond help.“The mainstream high streets are already dead. They can’t survive, the patient is dead,” he said, comparing the traditional town centre to a dead body at the bottom of a swimming pool. “Now what we’re talking about is can we save the vast minority?”Continuing with his mortality metaphor, the Newcastle United owner said the only way to resuscitate struggling retail companies was to give them a “massive electric shock”, in the form of a tax on online players. Mike Ashley ‘demands’ meeting with MPs to discuss high street crisisEvans Cycles sold to Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct Sports Direct sacks House of Fraser management teamAmazon named UK’s most reputable retailer as Sports Direct comes lastHe called for a 20 per cent sales tax on web purchases, to be applied to companies making more than 20 per cent of their sales online, which he said would encourage retailers to focus on their bricks and mortar stores. “The internet is killing the high street. If you want to save the high street you have to address that,” he said. “You have to tax the web boys 20 per cent.” The retail tycoon said this would have a negative impact on his own company, but said it was necessary “for the good of the high street”. Mr Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration earlier this year, and has vowed to save 80 per cent of the company’s stores. He also holds a significant stake in Debenhams and recently took over Evans Cycles. The committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, to which Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open - beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”He then added: “Before anybody says it, I’m not comparing myself to God.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But they missed it the first time around, making it one of a number of objects that the team hopes to go back and have a proper look at.The rover already snapped a photo of the object, showing its shiny coating amid the dust and rocks of the Martian surface.But it will investigate it further with other tools in an attempt to understand its chemistry. That will be done using the onboard ChemCam, a set of tools that can examine objects remotely.In the same journey, it will have a look at a number of other interesting specimens. One very small piece is “Flanders moss”, which has an interesting, dark coloured coating which the team hope to come to understand by examining its chemistry.All of the work comes after Curiosity welcomed another visitor to the planet from Earth, the InSight rover. Curiosity played Mr Rogers’ song “Won’t You Be My Neighbour”\u0026nbspto welcome its fellow visitor.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This has never been done before, said astrophysicist Marco Ajello​, who is lead author of the paper. Most of this light is emitted by stars that live in galaxies. And so, this has allowed us to better understand the stellar-evolution process and gain captivating insights into how the universe produced its luminous content.The calculations allowed scientists to work out the total number of photons ever emitted.Expressing the number they found is very difficult, in part because it relies on a number of variables. But it is also literally difficult to write out, because there are so many zeroes.In all, there have been four and then 85\u0026nbspzeroes of them.Despite that vast amount of light ever emitted, very little of it ever gets to us beyond the light we see from our own sun and galaxy. The brightness of the universe as it reaches us is roughly equivalent to looking at a 60-watt lightbulb in complete darkness, from 2.5 miles away.That is because the universe is so vast and distant. But the Fermi telescope allowed the researchers to look at the dim swirl of light that comes from stars, and in so doing calculate how much light was being absorbed and therefore how much there might ever have been around.The new discovery will now allow scientists to peek out into the very beginnings of the universe.The first billion years of our universe\u0027s history are a very interesting epoch that has not yet been probed by current satellites, Ajello said. Our measurement allows us to peek inside it. Perhaps one day we will find a way to look all the way back to the Big Bang.

We cannot change anything without breaking the law and we Brits don’t do that. We play by the rules.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the anti-Brexit European Research Group, said the paper “exposes inaccurate government spin on the proposed Brexit deal”.The most controversial issue in the withdrawal agreement is over the ‘backstop’ agreement, to set out what happens to keep the Irish border open if no trade deal is secured by the end of the Brexit transition period in December 2020.Under the plan the whole UK would stay in a customs union, but the legal document released on Monday confirms that this set up would continue to apply “unless and until it is superseded” by a subsequent agreement.It later goes on: “The agreement does not contain any provision on its termination.“In the absence of such a provision, it is not possible under international law for a party to withdraw from the agreement unilaterally.”The advice also confirms that the UK faces making additional payments to Brussels if the Brexit transition period is extended.Under the terms of the withdrawal agreement it is due to run until the end of December 2020 but can be extended by up to two years if both sides agree.The advice says that discussions on any extension would involve “reaching further agreement on the UK’s financial contribution”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

There is a real risk that if we don’t vote for this deal that there may be a majority in the House of Commons for a second referendum. And there is also the risk that if we don’t vote for this deal we may get a less good deal, or no deal at all. All of those are less attractive than this deal.“I actually think if there were a second referendum people would probably vote to Leave in even larger numbers than they did before. But the very act of calling a second referendum, I believe, would damage faith in democracy and rip apart the social fabric of this country.”Pressed on the Northern Ireland “backstop” – the EU’s insurance policy to avoid a hard border – Mr Gove said however “uncomfortable” it is for the UK, “it is more uncomfortable for the European Union”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivering to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal.

They\u0026nbspwere asked their opinions on their bank’s current account, and how likely they were to recommend the company. TSB’s overall score was 58 per cent, putting it in joint last place with Bank of Ireland, which was bottom of the table for the second year running. TSB sheds 20,000 current accounts in wake of massive IT failure Monzo to launch new crowdfunding round as it seeks $1bn valuationTSB boss Paul Pester steps down after new IT problemsTSB, which came in fourth in last year’s ranking, has suffered a crisis this year after a series of major IT failures, which caused\u0026nbspthousands of customers\u0026nbspto leave.Chief executive Paul Pester\u0026nbspstepped down over the tech meltdown and the chaos prompted a parliamentary inquiry. More than half of the TSB customers surveyed by Which? said they had experienced technical issues in the last year. The bank also scored poorly on customer service, telephone and online banking and complaint handling. “TSB’s slump suggests that customers felt outraged to have endured the prolonged IT issues that left millions locked out of their accounts,” said Gareth Shaw, money expert at Which?A TSB spokesperson said: “We’re sorry for the problems customers experienced as a result of our IT switch.“Regrettably this is why our scores are low in this poll. Our priority is putting things right for our customers and we’ve made significant progress.”Meanwhile, Monzo came out on top after reaching a large enough sample size for the first time since it launched in 2016. The\u0026nbsponline-only bank scored full marks for both communication and its app. With a total customer satisfaction score of 86 per cent, it narrowly beat telephone and online-only First Direct, which scored 85 per cent. Nationwide\u0026nbspcame in third\u0026nbspwith 79 per cent and challenger\u0026nbsp Bank was fourth with 76 per cent. Which? said this year’s ranking showed challenger banks were gaining favour. Mr Shaw said: “Impressive results from challenger banks place them well ahead of many of the biggest banking brands in Britain, showing that innovation and modern ideas are shaking up the market, with good customer service truly valued by customers.“Our research shows a clear gap between the best and worst providers and should act as a catalyst for customers unhappy with their service to switch banks – as it’s never been easier.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is not going to be straightforward.”Russia has been accused of interfering in western politics, including the US presidential race which put Donald Trump in the White House, the elections in France and Germany and referendums on Brexit and Catalan independence.\u0026nbspSecurity cooperation with Europe ‘imperative’, MI6 chief saysBut while there have been accusations of Beijing’s industrial espionage in the west, direct action has so far come from neighbouring countries. Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from providing 5G on grounds of national security.In only his second public address in four years as “C”, in charge of MI6, Mr Younger warned of the threat of technological espionage and “malign activity” by foreign powers.He said: “Our approach to attaching a cost to malign activity also applies to cyber attacks, as in March this year when the UK attributed responsibility for the NotPetya attack against Ukraine, which also affected the United Kingdom, to the Russian government.“Much of the evolving state threat is about our opponents’ increasingly innovative exploitation of modern technology. So simply put, we’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise.”We’ve got to innovate faster than they can. Indeed, future generations would not forgive us if it were otherwise“The need is to ensure that technology is on our side, not that of our opponents,” Mr Younger continued, describing how it had helped expose the Russian spies who allegedly poisoned former MI6 agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the Noivichok attack in Salisbury.“The digital era has profoundly changed our operating environment. Bulk data combined with modern analytics make the modern world transparent, a fact which contributed to GRU embarrassment after the Salisbury attack. But it is also a serious challenge if used against us,” he said, speaking at St Andrews University, where he studied economics and computer science before joining the British army and then MI6.“Cyber is now our fastest-growing directorate. We are shifting our focus to the nexus between humans and technology.“And for the first time, through the National Security Strategic Investment Fund, we are pursuing a completely different type of partnership with the tech-innovation community, giving the private and academic community the role we need and they deserve.”“Ironically, the most profound consequence of the technological challenge is a human one. We are determined to attract people with even higher levels of technical skill to join our ranks. But my organisation will need to adapt even faster if it is to thrive in the future. And that will require people with new perspectives, capable of harnessing their creativity in ways that we can’t yet even imagine.”Mr Younger also spoke about controversies surrounding two of Britain’s closes allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and UAE, over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the imprisonment of the British academic Matthew Hedges.The MI6 chief called the killing of Khashoggi, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October as “horrible” and\u0026nbsp“absolutely barbaric” and wanted to stress that there should be a “full and transparent investigation into what happened”.On the jailing of Mr Hedges, Mr Younger said he was “perplexed” by claims of the UAE authorities that he was a British spy. “I genuinely can’t understand how our Emirati partners came to the conclusions they came to,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT000452678557.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds weirdest homes","story":"His unique house is one of six featured in a new documentary, The Worlds Weirdest Homes.The Channel  show sees architect and presenter Charlie Luxton travel to far-flung destinations such as Arizona in the US, Dubai and Rio de Janiero to meet people who have chosen to live somewhere unusual.From the entrepreneur who lives on a version of Noahs Ark - complete with wooden beasts - to the scientists living on an exact replica of Mars, Sun Online takes a look at some of the most bonkers places people call home.Name: The Private ZooLocation: DubaiWho lives there  Rashed BelhasaThe son of billionaire UAE construction tycoon, Sa Ahmed Belhasa, Rashed is used to flaunting his luxurious lestyle online, posting several videos from the room he has just to house his growing trainer collection.But nothing has drawn attention as much as his impressive private zoo in the grounds of his dads opulently-decorated mega mansion.Rasheds collection of living beasts includes lions, tigers, panthers, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes and bears, all with pets ostentatiously named after his favourite brands - Versace, Armani and Dior.The zoo has attracted a number of celebrities, from singer Mariah Carey to Cristiano Ronaldo, Jackie Chan and Floyd Mayweather.Rashed says the younger animals get to come inside for snuggles, and claims he is the only  year old in the world with his own zoo.However, he has come under fire from people who have branded the zoo cruel, but says his father inspired him to help animals after he started taking in neglected creatures from other private zoos.We dont make profit from it, says Rashed. When I went to Kenya I saw lions dying because they only ate once a month. Here they eat every single day.Name: Mars Desert Research StationLocation: UtahWho lives there  A group of eight scientistsWith plans to eventually form a colony on Mars - and Elon Musk saying he wants to put people on the red planet by , it seems important that humans are well prepared.Thats where the Mars Desert Research Station comes in. Built in the early noughties, it is a replica space station where scientists live exactly asit were Mars,  .The base is located in the remote desert of Utah near the small town of Hanksville.The area looks very like Mars due to the barren red rock, mountains and sand, as well as similar rock types to those found on the Red Planet.The tiny base, where eight scientists live on a rotating basis, is smaller than an average London one-bed flat and features bunk beds in tiny closet-style rooms.They have just one toilet to share, and are only able to eat freeze-dried food asthey are in Space.People tell us that we are running around playing dress-up in a spacesuit, but its not like that at all, says Dr Shannon Rupert, who heads up the project.Name: Noahs ArkLocation: The NetherlandsWho lives there  Dutch entrepreneur Aad PetersIn , Johan Huibers, a Dutch Christian fundamentalist, decided to build a replica of Noahs Ark as he wanted to save humanity from sin after having a vision.Painstakingly crafted, the replica is  metres long, . metres wide,  metres high and made of steel, pine and cedar.In , Huibers sold the ark for £, to Aad Peters, an entrepreneur who wanted to sail the vessel around Northern Europe with live animals on board including camels and elephants - two-by-two of course.However, Aad was forced to concede three months later that unlike in the Biblical Story, an ark is not a suitable home for animals, so he took them off board.Theres not a lot of space...its like camping on sea, says Aad. If the wind blows it and youre lying shivering under five blankets you wonder am I stupid  but it is what it is. If you choose to do something you have to do it.Last year, he collided with a few other boats during a storm, and its also caught fire.At present, it is currently anchored by a car park and is a museum filled with wooden animals, but Aad says he plans to sail the high seas once it is repaired.Name: Sandcastle HouseLocation: Rio de Janeiro, BrazilWho lives there  Marcio Mizael MatoliasSea views are desired by many of us - and Rio de Janeiro resident Marcio Mizael Matolia has found a nty way to get a prime spot without the hefty price tag.For the past  years, the self-styled King of the Castle, who is adorned with a plastic crown, has lived inside his sandcastle.He says the seat outside is his pulpit, where he sits for people to come and pay respect to him and donate money to him to help him live in his strange structure.The impressive creation, in an exclusive neighbourhood surrounded by luxury flats worth millions, has  turrets, which he made by hand using sand, drtwood and water.However, though it looks great from the outside, Marcios living space is a six metre square room held up by a wooden frame.I dug a hole, then put some wood underneath so it didnt sink, says Marcio. Its a real work of architecture and engineering.Unsurprisingly, there are some setbacks with this set up. He doesnt have amenities such as a toilet so he uses public loos when he needs a poo and wees in the sea.In the rainy season his castle washes away, meaning it needs constant repairs. It takes between six and eight hours to make a couple of towers, so he can find this incredibly frustrating.Name: Freedom CoveLocation: British Columbia, CanadaWho lives there  Wayne Adams and Catherine KingThe pair have lived on the secluded farm, which floats on the ocean and weighs  tonnes - the same as a ship - for  years.The home, which is anchored to shore using lines like a giant spiders web, boasts huge areas of garden, a multi-coloured house, art gallery, dance floor and even a lighthouse.Its here that Catherine grows fruit and vegetables while Wayne, who built all of Freedom Cove himself, creates additions to their home in his workshop. The pair also fish from a hole in the floor.However, the house has regularly suffered from severe storm damage as its built in an area known for high winds.The pair say the roof has blown off several times, and ious sections of it have been completely destroyed at times.Name: Falcons NestLocation: Prescott, ArizonaWho lives there  Tarot readers Ernst and SrishtiErnst and Srishti often ran around the countryside near their home in Arizona, dreaming of owning the very peculiar building theyd go past.Falcons Nest towers at over ft high and with  floors, is the tallest single-family home on the planet. It was out of the couples price range at £.million- but an accident last year changed everything.The sporty pair were out on one of their regular runs when they were run over by a pick-up truck.Their insurance payout meant they would be in a position to buy it and they jumped at the chance.With stunning views over Arizona, the main living area has , square feet of space all the way up on the sixth floor.However, it takes a lot of maintenance: two days to clean all  windows using a special brush as they are so high up, and several people in the town complained about the building, calling it an eyesore.And the couple also admit their unusual abode attracts a lot of attention, with people pulling up outside in the cars to take photos on a regular basis.Our home is a tourist attraction, they tell Charlie Luxton.Thats certainly something you can say for all these other unusual buildings too.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Other benefits like Carers Allowance, Personal Independent Payments, and Child Benefit are still separate to Universal Credit and wont be part of your lump payment.But the income from that could affect your Universal Credit amount.You might need to book and attend an interview at your local Jobcentre before you get your first payment.Once you have successfully applied and have given all the relevant information, it will take five weeks for your first sum to come through.But you can apply for an advance  you dont feel youll be able to manage financially until that happens. The money you owe will be taken off your UC sum in future months.After youve applied you can sign in to your Universal Credit online account to report changes in circumstances, add notes to your journal, see anything you need to do, and check when your payment is coming."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/NINTCHDBPICT0004506571551-e1543531251522.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn trying to ruin economy","story":"Just the threat of the lelong Marxist in Downing Street has seen huge amounts of cash leave the UK, and it could be just a taster.We don’t buy the ridiculous Project Fear sequel.But imagine the Bank’s apocalyptic scenario is anywhere half-close to true.Now imagine a Corbyn government committed to massive increases in corporation and income tax, a wealth windfall tax, and nationalising everything within touching distance.Even the Shadow Chancellor has said there’d be a run on the Pound.It’d make even the most chaotic clean break look a walk in the park.People think Venezuela-style destitution could never happen in Britain. But Labour’s cockamamie policies and the potential second referendum they’ve opened the door to would put us in a more dangerous place than ever before.It’s easy to look at a split Tory party and consider the alternative.The incompetent rabble on Labour’s front bench would be much, much worse.IT ISN’T too late for the PM to salvage her Brexit deal — and the answer is staring her in the face.The catchily-named “termination clause with explicit unilateral mechanism” would allow us to trigger an end to the backstop without the EU holding us hostage indefinitely. It would make this clunking deal more palatable.The worst of it is the clause is already written — but our mandarin-in-chief Olly Robbins lobbied No not to suggest it. He claimed we’d never make any progress. With friends like these, PM…Mrs May mustto the EU and demand the right to get out of an arrangement which would be bad for the UK and bad for the Republic of Ireland. Without it, her bill will need a miracle to get through Parliament, and even then it’d hobble our negotiating strategy for the future partnership.It’s back to Brussels. And take the clause with you, this time.ANOTHER year, another bumper hike in train fares.But commuters’ rightful anger should be turned on the militant unions, not the Government.Their refusal to negotiate over planned pay rises — which are pegged to a higher rate of inflation than almost everybody  in the country — means harsher fare increases.Meanwhile the aptly named RMT boss Mick Cash takes home a pay packet bigger than the PM’s.Nowt too good for the bosses...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A growing number of other ministers share this concern.Theresa May, of course doesn’t want no deal. She wants Parliament to approve the deal she has negotiated.But, right now, it is hard to see how it passes.The DUP have said they won’t vote for it, denying the Government its majority, and  Tory MPs have declared they will vote against it — ­suggesting the Government is on course for a heavy defeat.“It is increasingly dficult to see what rescues this,” said one of those charged with getting it through.Given thatthe withdrawal agreement is defeated and nothing is put in its place then this country leaves the EU without a deal, it is foolish not to massively intensy planning for that outcome.At every point since the ­referendum, the Government has put off crucial decisions on no-deal planning.This has weakened the UK’s negotiating position and means the UK is now ill-prepared for what Mrs May admits is one of the three most likely outcomes.The situation is so serious that one member of the Privy Council told me this week that the military should be drafted in to help.This former Cabinet minister’s argument was that only the military had the logistical know-how to ensure that ­critical supplies make it all around the country in time.May still hasn’t given up on getting the withdrawal agreement through Parliament.But there is little sign of a decisive sht in her favour.Cabinet ministers are still talking in terms of the scale of defeat, rather than of victory.The expectation among ­ministers is thatMay loses the vote by  or less, she will seek clarication on the ­backstop and then try and bring it back to the Commons.But, as one leading member of the Cabinet warns, May will have to move fast.If she loses the meaningful vote she “could face the  letters and a vote of no confidence in short order”.THE Housing Secretary, James Brokenshire, has scored a ­signicant victory over the Chancellor.Brokenshire wanted to reduce the maximum deposit that renters would have to pay from six weeks’ rent to five.The idea was that this would be fairer on tenants who must find the money for the deposit up front. But Philip Hammond objected.The Chancellor wrote to Cabinet colleagues that “I cannot agree to the proposed concession to lower the deposit cap from six weeks’ rent to five weeks’ rent.“Six weeks’ rent was already placing landlords at risk of uncovered loss for damage to property, as well as risk of loss of rent.“This bill was always a high- risk measure. A cap of six weeks’ rent was already a major concession and I believe we have to hold the line at this level.”However, Hammond’s objections have not carried the day. The Government will now back reducing the deposit cap to five weeks for all but the most expensive properties.One of the Tories’ biggest problems is being seen as the landlords’ party. Hammond himself declares rental income of more than £,.In , the Tories were more popular than Labour among those who rented in the private sector.But at the last election, ­Labour had a -point lead over the Tories among private renters.The Tories won’t win these voters back by dragging their feet on measures that make le easier for tenants.SENIOR Labour figures are plotting a route to an early General Election that doesn’t involve having to get two thirds of the Commons to vote for it.One close ally of Jeremy Corbyn in the Shadow Cabinet tells me that the plan would be to defeat the Government in a confidence motionthe ­Government loses the meaningful vote.The idea would be to persuade the DUP to join with Labour and the other opposition parties in voting against the Government. This would result in a narrow defeat for Theresa May.At that point, the Fixed Term Parliament Act allows  days for the Commons to approve an alternative government.In these circumstances, no government could be approved – the DUP wouldn’t actively put ­Corbyn into No  while no Tory leader could be elected in that time who would meet the DUP’s requirements on the backstop.The result of all this would be that with ­Parliament deadlocked, there would have to be another General Election.How realistic the Labour front bench consider this scenario is crucial. For there is mounting tension in the Shadow Cabinet about whether or not Labour should formally back a second referendum.At the moment, Labour’s policy is to push for a General Election above all .But this week, John McDonnell – the Shadow Chancellor – admitted that securing a General Election was “very dficult” so the party may well back a second referendum instead.TORY party donors have received a letter from party HQ defending the deal that Theresa May has ­negotiated.Attached to the letter is a rather revealing document setting out why “the backstop is needed in all scenarios”.It lists four future scenarios for UK EU relations – a Canada-style trade deal, EEA membership, a UK EU customs union and the UK being in both the customs union and the single market.Three of these four options would be deemed unacceptable by most Brexiteer MPs.WHEN the then Culture Secretary Matt Hancock scrapped Leveson , the next stage of the inquiry into the Press, critics claimed that either Parliament or the courts would force him into a U-turn.But the key votes in the Commons were won, and this week the courts rejected the appeal for a judicial review of the decision.With Labour having gone cold on Section , which would have forced newspapers to sign up to a state regulator or pay both sides’ costs in disputes, the freedom of the Press remains.The challenge now is never to allow it to be threatened in this way again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The PM is in Buenos Aires rightly extolling our virtues to world leaders, but it’s hard to shake the feeling that her Cabinet are afraid that Britain cannot make it on its own. That weakness has been exploited time after time by EU negotiators.If only they shared the faith of those who voted for a brighter future.The scandalous lack of planning for a clean break, as James Forsyth makes clear on this very page, is a result of the Government only ever looking for pitfalls — rather than grabbing the opportunities that are so obviously out there for a reinvigorated Britain.It’s not too late. If the PM loses the crunch vote in Parliament, we must step up preparations to leave without a deal by several notches.And that might well see Brussels bureaucrats, for all their harsh words, coming back to the negotiating table.The disgraced tycoon Max Mosley, via his family trust, has pledged to keep funding this so-called independent body for years to come, as he continues his vendetta against the free Press.Labour donor Mr Mosley is no fan of the papers, and not just for exposing his extra-curricular activities. The media also uncovered his racist past, including pamphlets warning: “Coloured immigration threatens your children’s health.”When that bile came to light, the Labour Party promised not to take another penny from him. But he’s spent years bankrolling their Deputy Leader Tom Watson’s office to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds.Isn’t it time the cash was handed back, Mr Watson Ms Bibi, a Pakistani Catholic, was acquitted last month of blasphemy charges — a charge which had left her on death row.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is something we are seeing worldwide, not only in Africa.”Brandford said in the elephant case the unit treating the elephant was the DSWT KWS Tsavo Veterinary Unit, headed by KWS Vet, Dr Poghon.He explained despite the deep impact of the spear tip, the skull makeup of the huge animal helped her survive the injury.He said: “If you took a cross section of an elephant’s skull it would appear like honeycomb.It is basically to reduce weight, because elephant skulls are so large, and need to be for the ears, trunk and of course tusks, they cannot be too heavy.“They have this sponge-like structure, and fortunately for this elephant, that is where the spear landed.“Of course, much deeper, or further down, could have been a dferent matter, hitting an eye for example.”Brandford added that the treatment of the elephant was a good example of persistence paying off.A lion was also on the receiving end of a spear attack a year ago, and these images show just how close it had come to death.As the lion lay on the ground sedated, a huge two-metre spear can be seen sticking out of his face just below the right eye.According to the DSWT, human-wildle conflict is one of the most pressing threats facing Africa’s wildle."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453588667.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"52ft christmas tree planted 40 years ago","story":"Avril Rowlands and her husband Christopher stuck a ft fir in their front garden after enjoying their first Christmas at their new home in .Now the tree towers above their four-bedroom detached house and the couple have to hire a cherry picker to decorate it using more than , lights.And on Sunday, the couple celebrated the monster firs th anniversary when they switched on the lights.It now illuminates the entire street where the couple live in Inkberrow, Worcs.Retired TV writer Avril, , said: The switch-on event has become an absolute institution for the village and we have hundreds of people see the tree.Weve even had tourists coming from as far as China to have their pictures taken by the tree.It is amazing to think that the tree started as a ft tall sapling which we bought for just £.I remember after that first Christmas thinking to myself that I didnt want to just throw the tree out so I planted it in the front garden.It took straight away and every year its just grown taller and taller.It now takes , to light the tree, I dont look at the electricity bill until after Christmas.The couple moved to the quiet village in the summer of  after selling their home in London.And their annual switch-on event has become a local institution which raises thousands of pounds for charity.Retired BBC editor Christopher, , said: A lot of people in the village say that its the start of their Christmas.We usually raise about £, a year for charity, a dferent one each year - this year all the money is going to the Midlands Air Ambulance.Over the last  years weve raised over £, for charity.Were delighted the tree has spread so much happiness and raised so much money.We expect itll be for many years to come.Inkberrow is one of a handful of villages in the country which doesnt have any street lights and the tree can be seen from a mile away at night when it is lit up.A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said: This is a remarkable tree which has obviously been taken care of.Pine trees can grow to huge heights so time will only tellthis one grows any larger."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000453586368-e1543850306573.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"stunning secluded mansion with its own peninsula in devon goes on the market for 10m","story":"Gurrow Point, known as one of the finest homes in the south west,  is a s mansion that overlooks the glorious River Dart in Devon.Nestled near the village of Dittisham, the six-bedroom property has its own tennis courts, sauna and its own three-bedroom cottage on the grounds.The secluded home is ideal for water-loving families as it has two slipways and a jetty providing direct access to one of Britains best sailing estuaries.Unsurprisingly, the current owners rent their property out for weddings - allowing couples to say I do in the beautul surroundings.The property has been modied and extended over the years and now has , sq ft of accommodation.It has a reception hall, drawing room, sitting room, study, dining room, orangery, kitchen breakfast room, conservatory, library, billiard room, sauna, six bedrooms, five bathrooms and a two-bedroom staff flat which has its own entrance.There is also a triple garage and workshop, large barn, boules court and croquet lawn.Sarah-Jane Bingham-Chick, from Savills, said: This property takes your breath away.

Hallie-Mae made it to the hospital in time to meet her little brother and spent two hours with him before he passed. Jasmine said: Its been the hardest year of our lives, without our daughter I dont know how we would have gotten through it, she really has been our rock. On the day of his funeral she saw us upset in the family car, she was sat in the middle of us both and just reached out to grab both of our hands and never let go the entire journey. She really got us through that day and every other day through our journey. It feels like living two lives, one where youre trying so desperately to be normal, where in reality you just feel empty.

The large light display appeared at the front of a home on a quiet residential street in Reading, Berks., yesterday It is believed to have been put up by a group of students living in the house. Stephen Bailey-Todd,  who lives nearby was in complete disbelief when he spotted the bright shining penis while out on a walk. He said: It was quite a shock to be honest. When you walk home you just don’t expect to come face to face with an enormous penis on a wall. The lights were flashing and it is so in your face, you cannot help staring at it. I was in complete disbelief. I know young people like to have fun but it’s deeply offensive and shows a lack of respect.  The dad- of-one added: I would hope thatthey are students, their university or college takes some form of action against them. It’s not the sort of thing you would want a child to see. The display was put up only a short walk away from Reading University. Those looking to send phallic-based Christmas cards to their loved one better think again. Earlier this year, British card company begged its customers to stop using pictures of their genitals. The company allows customers to send relatives a special treat in the form of a personalised card or gt. Users can upload pretty much any photo they want to the website in order to create a cheeky or cute present to celebrate a birthday, Christmas , graduation, Easter, Valentines Day or other special occassion. However it turns out there are a few things you shouldnt try and stick on your card. In a post on Twitter , Moonpig UK asked customers to refrain from uploading pictures of their genitals to the website. The tweet read: Please stop uploading pics of your genitals to our cards it is against our ts and cs. Moonpigs terms and conditions clearly state that the company does not allow pornographic or offensive material to be featured on their cards.

Nesdi Jones, who is fluent in three languages, was carrying her baby daughter in a sling when the man called her stupid among other things. But he was left pretty sheepish when Welsh singer-songwriter Nesdi quickly replied, reports Wales Online. The -year-old was on a family break with her three-month-old daughter, Cadi-Glyn, and was staying in Morfa Bychan at Greenacres Holiday Park. As she walked through the caravan park mid-afternoon, she passed a group of people, one of whom turned to his friend and sniggered.  I had my three-month-old daughter in a sling when I walked past a group of men, she said. One bloke just turned around and just sniggered something like look at that woman with her baby stuck on her tummy, stupid in Welsh. I dont remember exactly, because I was just so angry. I just turned to him and said I know what you are saying. They ran off pretty quickly then. The renowned singer, who is fluent in Welsh, English and Hindi, was brought up in Criccieth. If you are going to slag me and my baby off, make sure I cant understand you, she added. It happened to my mum as well, and it happens when I go to India and people say things like white girl in Hindi. They never expect me to turn around and reply in their language. I guess you get horrid people in every nationality.  Nesdi took to Twitter to vent her fury, and received supportive messages in response. One replied and said: Good for you, bullying is bullying in whatever the language, should have kicked him in the b*******, stand up be proud be Welsh, take no s***. Another said: Unfortunately every nation has its ignorant gits. Nesdis website describes her as a multi-charting, award-winning singer and rapper in Welsh, Hindi, English and Punjabi. She also blogs about motherhood and mental health, and has spoken out against sex abuse.

A poll of , parents revealed just one in  children has asked for a new bike or skateboard from Santa, and only one in  have requested rollerblades. Instead, consoles and games, Lego and smartphones are among the top items on children’s wish-lists. Kids obsession with high-tech gadgets is leaving parents fearing they will have a struggle on their hands trying to prise their children away from screens and get them outdoors. It also emerged seven in  mums and dads claim their little ones spend too much time indoors during the festive period. In fact, two thirds of parents polled by multi-sports retailer, Decathlon said their offspring will only really step outside to visit family over Christmas. One in  even admit that their children don’t venture out of the house at all for a week or more during the Christmas break. Peter Lazarus, cycling manager at Decathlon said: “It’s not uncommon for children to be inactive during the festive period. They have toys to play with, films to watch and games consoles – plenty to keep them entertained without braving the cold and dark. “Buying kids an outdoor gt like a bike can be a great way of getting them out in the fresh air over Christmas and setting them up for a more active year ahead. “A quick cycle around the park, an hour on a skateboard or a walk in the countryside will all help to tear children away from their screens while keeping fitness levels up.”  The research found the lure of new Christmas gts is one of the biggest reasons for children staying inside Computer games, iPads and the jam-packed schedule of Christmas TV are the most common distractions. Six in  parents said they have to encourage their children to step away from their screens over the festive period. And another  per cent have bought their children outdoor gts for Christmas in an attempt to get them out of the house. According to the study, the average child will spend just an hour and  minutes outside per day during the school Christmas holiday. Three in  youngsters will get  minutes or less of fresh air. But in comparison, three hours a day will be spent in front of the TV while another two-and-a-half hours will be devoted to playing on iPads, phones or computer games. Jack Shakespeare of ukactive Kids, a not-for-profit group of organisations that campaigns for better health, added: “Movement has been stripped out of our children’s lives, with Generation Inactive fed a staple diet of sofa play and screen time, while being starved of outdoor activities. “It is vital for the health and happiness of this generation that we find ways to get children active and social outside of term time – whether a festive family walk or opening up schools to offer activities during the holidays.” The poll, via OnePoll, also revealed nearly one third of children in the UK now don’t even own a bike, and over four in ten of those that do haven’t ridden it for more than a month.

Dozens of mums and dads at Pontprennau Primary School, in Cardf, were seen with camping chairs, blankets and Thermos flasks as they waited to secure one of just  places. The school said the plans were put in place after consulting parents and they received no complaints when they were announced in October. One mum of a pupil at the school, who did not want to be named, told Wales Online: The last time they said we could email in on a one by one basis. But people complained that they could not use email. Now we have gone back to the dark ages.   The mum said parents were calm as they queued amid cold and wet weather. She said: Its just awful. Im not well at the moment anyway, I really didnt need it. It was freezing cold. People had Thermos flasks and blankets on the floor. People had really thought out their plans. The schools breakfast club has space for  children. Half of them are paid for places which have an earlier opening time and cost pound a day. Parents will have to sign up again in July for the following September term. The mum added: You pay all this money and its this dficult. Its incredibly frustrating. If you dont get a place you have to reallocate your child care or change your work hours. Pontprennau Primary School said registration for the places opened at .am, as planned and advertised, but the school opened the building earlier so parents queueing could come inside out of the wind and rain. A school spokesperson said: This process for breakfast club registration has been put in place after the school consulted with parents on how they would like it to work. The results of the consultation showed that the favoured option amongst parents was a queuing system, with places allocated on a first come, first served basis. The school didn’t receive any complaints from parents when these new arrangements were communicated to them in October. Like most primary schools, Pontprennau’s breakfast club is extremely popular with parents but we only have so many places available, which unfortunately does mean that some families will miss out. Therefore, a system has to be put in place to allocate those places. The school will continue to monitor the process, and continue to listen to all its parents, to ensure the system is as transparent and as fair as possible. They added any parents with concerns can contact the school and speak to a member of staff. In July more than  parents at another Cardf School, Ysgol Y Berllan Deg in Llanedeyrn, queued from am to make sure they had a space at their breakfast club.

Lawyers for Paul Worthington are claiming a coroner “overstepped the mark” when he included signs of sexual abuse in the record of her death – even though she suffocated in bed. Mr Worthington, who refused to answer questions about how Poppi died  times, wants the reference to her internal injuries deleted from the findings. The ex-supermarket worker has taken his case to the High Court in Manchester, where it is not knownhe has legal aid.   Poppi’s mum, who cannot be named, is said to be devastated that he is refusing to accept the coroner’s findings on the December  tragedy . Fiona McGhie, a lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the mum, said: “The years since Poppi died have been a complete nightmare for her. “It is likely that she may never get full closure on exactly what happened that night.”   Ms McGhie said the mum understood Mr Worthington, , was entitled not to answer questions at the inquest. But she added: “She considers that the coroner’s inquiry was frustrated by this. She is now disappointed that he has challenged the coroner.” The inquest heard -month-old Poppi died in an “unsafe sleeping environment” in her father’s bed at the family home in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.  Cumbria coroner David Roberts ruled that she had suffered internal injuries but that these were not the cause of her death, which was asphyxia. Mr Worthington, who was never charged with any offence after police botched an investigation, is now in hiding.   Leslie Thomas QC, representing him, told the High Court the coroner was wrong to include a mention of the injuries because the record should only detail how the child died. He said: “It is perfectly clear this was an asphyxia death. He has overstepped the mark.” But Samantha Leek QC, representing the coroner, said: “She came by her death because she is brought into bed to be harmed. It would be completely articial to leave that out.” Mr Justice Hickinbottom said he would reserve judgment.

He said: “Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years - climate change. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.

He said: “We have overrun it in a way that is unprecedented. No other creature in the world has had the effect on the planet that the human species has, and so we ought to be aware of what we’ve done and recognise the responsibility that we now have in our hands.”  As he delivered his apocalyptic warning, these images, shortlisted for the Wildle Photographer of the Year LUMIX People’s Choice Award, showed some of the wonders of the natural world we are putting at risk.

But it’s not just spelling which is a cause for concern, as four in  adults admit they don’t know the dference between a semi-colon and a colon, and a further  per cent are never sure where to insert speech marks. Gyles Brandreth, author of the new grammar guide ‘Have You Eaten Grandma ’ said: “The English language, and the way we use it, is ever-evolving, so it is no wonder people get confused when trying to write.

Ralphie Waplington is in heavy demand from brands desperate to have him model their products. Each picture on his Instagram account - which has more than , followers - shows him without a hair out of place, and his mum has banned family members from sharing pictures of him. Mum-of-one Stacey Woodhams, who runs the account, has landed a bumper crop of freebies from sharing posts of the little boy, including his entire wardrobe, bedroom furniture and days out. And she says she’s even keen to have another baby - so the child can tap into Instagram’s huge market for newborn ‘influencers’ now that Ralphie is too old. Stacey admits that she’s received hate mail and threats from fellow mothers online and warns parents that they shouldn’t run Instagram accounts for their children unless they’re prepared for the gut-wrenching backlash.   But Ralphie can make hundreds of pounds from a single sponsored post and has a dferent pram for every day of the week, all sent to him for free, infor a photograph. Stacey, from Brentwood, Essex, who styles all his outfits and snaps photos with her smartphone, says she has landed more than pound, worth of freebies for her star child. The -year-old originally set up an Instagram account for Ralphie when he was seven days old so that their family could see him grow. But within a month, she had amassed more than , followers and now spends hours every day focusing on Ralphie’s account.   She credits the social media giant for giving her the opportunity to work from home as she earns enough from running the account alongside her own business Mummas Prints. After a slew of adoring comments on his photographs, she realised that her son could become an ‘influencer’, opening up chances to work with brands and companies. As a family, Stacey, Ralphie, and his dad Adam Waplington, , have enjoyed free trips to theme parks, posh meals and popular tourist highlights, including Peppa Pig World. She earns a salary from his posts which she says she spends on family days out and treats for her boy. On top of his income from Instagram, the tot, who turns two in December, also earns a salary from modelling for brands including Next, which is kept separately in his own bank account.   Stacey said: “I’ve worked really hard to achieve what we have achieved and everything I do is for Ralphie and his future. “If a photo of him in a tracksuit with snot running down his face and his hair is messy gets put on social media, that is not representative of the brands we are representing. “It sounds awful referring to him a brand because he is a human and a child but essentially, the name that we have created is a business. “And that’s what I’m trying to say to people when they bash me, this is a business. “It’s not dferent to me leaving the house at am and ing at pm but instead I have a job where Ralphie reaps the rewards and I get to spend all day with my son. “So our family aren’t allowed to post photos unless it’s a photo we’ve already posted or a photo I’ve approved. “And before I take any photographs, we’ll make sure his hair is brushed. It’s about giving him a bit of dignity, after all I wouldn’t post a photo of me not at my best!   “One lady had a go at me saying I was too busy taking photos of him posing as a model. “Well, he is a model. He’s represented by an agency, he does a lot of modelling and he’s worked with some really big names. “So yes, I do take photos where he looks lovely because he is!” Stacey makes sure she plans ahead so photos of Ralphie are strategically shared when they’re likely to receive the most attention. She says this includes posting photos at am when fellow frazzled parents are likely to be scrolling through their phone whilst their children keep them awake. Overall, Ralphie’s received more than  free outfits, as well as free bedroom furniture, free designer toys and eight prams sent by baby brands. And Stacey and Adam have received free meals including a lavish afternoon tea at Fortnum  Mason, treatments at salons and gts including a free set of luggage and a free kingsize mattress.   Stacey said: “We’ve been invited to days out at themes parks, we’ve been offered hotel stays, a furniture company gave us all of Ralphie’s bedroom furniture. “I’ve been sent handbags, suitcases, Hugo Boss designer clothes. We got a luggage set for all of us. “Ralphie is really lucky. All of his clothing comes from Forever Sewing, they sponsor his wardrobe, and we love working with small businesses. But his profile didnt become a viral sensation overnight, as Stacey says she spent months ensuring that regular daily uploads saw her gain followers. She says she works hard to portray the daily struggles of motherhood rather than presenting a le that many cannot relate too. However, the effort was worth it, as the mum says Ralphie earns up to pound per sponsored post. But while most fans praise the handsome toddler and are quick to praise Stacey for her hard work, others aren’t so quick to big the tot’s Instagram page up. In the past, she’s received messages accusing of neglecting her son in favour of taking photographs of him. Stacey said: ‘I definitely put on a front so when someone calls you a bad mum, it really does hurt me.   “I just think thatsomeone was doing what I do but wasn’t in the right frame of mind, I wonder what these Instagram trolls could do. “I think people don’t realise the nastiness of what they say and how it could affect someone.” Although she admits to having spent a lot of time on her phone, she insists that Ralphie never notices. She says: “It only take a split second to take a photograph and I do all the editing when he’s asleep or Adam is home. “There’s a lot of prep work. You can only photograph himhe’s in a good mood and he’s happy to play. “I never force him to sit still, I just snap him in the moment so he’s none the wiser and it’s just like any other mum capturing a photo.   “He’s at that age where we can explain to him what we’re doing. “Obviously its stressful because you have a brief from some brands to get it from a certain angle and just one shot to do it. “Once you set it up,he messes it all up, then you won’t get a good image. So we really do have to work as a team. “I’ve got Adam running around like a performing monkey distracting him but Ralphie just laughs and thinks its funny. “We’ve visited some great places and he’s actually having a lot of fun but for me, it’s like being at work, “So I’m filming, editing and doing Instagram stories on my phone and probably looking like I’m having the worst time. “So it’s not all it seems.” And as Ralphie’s following increases, Stacey says she understands why parents might criticise her. She said: “We’re exposing Ralphie to a le that’s he’s not had a choice in. He’s not been able to say ‘yes mummy’, I want to do this.   ‘Ultimately, we try and understand it from people with a negative opinion. “How we see it is, yes, there’s a lot of views and opinions on what we do and how we could be putting him in danger. “But at the same time, I know that everything we post is filtered and we want to portray him as the little boy having fun that he is. “I can see why people would think we are using him as a tool for potentially making a name for our family, and as a form of income but this isn’t the case. “But I post to inspire other people that you can achieve anything. I am an ordinary girl from a really ordinary background. “I’ve had ups and downs in my lives but I know you can achieve anythingyou work hard at it. “I feel really grateful to be given the opportunities that we have been given.” And as Ralphie gets older, brands are becoming more intrigued by the rest of the family, including Adam, who works in the wholesale restaurant business.   The pair recently set up an Instagram account focused on him and hope that he may be able to quit his full-time job in the future. Adam said: “I’m still really new to the whole thing. “We found that opportunities would come up that involved dads so we thought it was a no-brainerI got involved.” But Stacey says that she still spends a lot of time contacting brands to suggest they work with her. She said: “It’s like any business, You have to go out and get it. “I’d say seventy per cent of the work we obtain is through me reaching out to source it, and thirty per cent where we get contacted directly.” Now the -year-old has begun running workshops for fellow parents on how to use social media and promote their businesses or their own family influencer accounts.

The UK has been enjoying milder than average temperatures this week but that will all change tonight when the mercury drops to -C. It will be the coldest night of the year so far with snow affecting some areas from tomorrow evening. Most of the UK will wake up to a covering of frost on Tuesday morning, following the night of sub-zero temperatures. But north Wales, the Peak District and Pennines will be hit by snow from Tuesday evening.  Becky Mitchell, a meteorologist with the Met Office, told : There is a risk of hill snow from Tuesday evening and overnight until early Wednesday. Northern Wales, northern England will see some snow settling. We could see cm and possibly cm of snow on the highest Pennines. Although its been mild recently, its going to turn colder tomorrow. In the areas expecting snow, temperatures will be around C which isnt exceptionally cold but a band of rain is pushing up from the south and as it moves up into the colder air, thats where we could see a bit of snow on Tuesday night.  The Met Office has put a yellow warning in place for the Dumfries and Galloway areas of Scotland urging people to be aware of icy roads, pavements and cycle paths. After the steep drop in temperatures, the rest of the week looks unsettled across the UK. She added: From Wednesday afternoon onwards, were back to milder temperatures - were expecting double figures quite wildly across the country. But from Wednesday the weather will be quite unsettled - itll be wet and windy across most of the UK right through the weekend and into early next week.  Tonight Further showers are likely across some northern and western parts overnight, mainly on coasts and hills. Clear spells where, leading to a fairly widespread frost. Some fog patches are possible. Overnight lows from  to C are expected on the south coast with the mercury dropping to around freezing where. Coldest values will be felt in northern England and Scotland where temperatures could plunge as low as -C in the Highlands. Tuesday There will be some sunny or bright spells initially in the east, but otherwise, it will be a rather cloudy day as a band of rain pushes up from the south-west, perhaps bringing some hill snow to northern parts later. Much of Scotland will remain dry until evening, however, becoming windy later. Wednesday Wednesday, a wet and windy start for many, though it should become more settled later, with perhaps with some bright spells for western parts. Fine and cold over Scotland. Thursday Rather cloudy on Thursday with little in the way of brightness expected,any, as a band of rain spreads eastwards, accompanied with some brisk winds too.

Catherine Englefield noticed bushes were trampled and someone had stamped on her late husband Maurices memorial. Shocked at the sight, Catherine, who is in her late s, was further horried when someone living near the cemetery told her she spotted two men having sex in the same spot one night. Mr Englefields ashes were scattered at the cemetery in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, in memory of where he was brought up and had lived for many years. The heartbroken widow said that the neighbour had reported the incident to police but no-one had been detained.It came after numerous complaints of anti-social behaviour - including drinking and late-night gatherings - in the cemetery, which is kept open at night so people can cut through. Mrs Englefield, an NHS worker who now lives in Aylesbury, Bucks., said: I thought it would be nice for Maurices friends and familyhis ashes were scattered in Chesham - it is where he was born and lived. But now I am wonderingI have made a mistake because some people have no morals. I was so upset when I arrived and saw all the broken bushes and it looked like someone had sat on or stamped on the memorial. When the neighbour told me what had happened I was devastated. There is just no respect. To me, a cemetery is a sacred place.  She is now calling for the cemetery gates to be locked at night in a bid to reduce the risk of antisocial behaviour - and has even involved her MP, David Lidington. She said: Anyone can go in there - andyoure going in there at night, it is not going to be for a nice reason. People pay their respects during the day.The council and police say they want to keep the gates open so people can cut through there but what about those who are affected by this bad behaviour  I never see a police officer there. Since my husband died I want to move back to France, but I cannot go until this is sorted out. Bill Reid, town clerk at Chesham Town Council, said the authority was aware of the issues with the cemetery and had made efforts to improve sight lines by cutting back hedges and removing benches where people had congregated for antisocial reasons. However, he said that police were keen for the cemetery to remain open at night and there were no immediate plans to lock it up at night.

Emile Ratelband, who remains , argued that he felt far more youthful than his birth certicate implied, and asked this to be recognised legally. He also said his age limited his success on dating app Tinder, and said he should be allowed to be  again. However a district court in the Netherlands said this was not possible in a ruling today. Officials ruled that changing someones age would affect the legal responsibilities that come with the passing of time. In a ruling published online, the court said: The court did not find any reason in Mr Ratelband’s arguments to create new case law in line with the statutory provisions on changes to a person’s officially registered name or gender.  Its main reason was that, unlike the situation with respect to a change in registered name or gender, there are a iety of rights and duties related to age, such as the right to vote and the duty to attend school. If Mr Ratelband’s request was allowed, those age requirements would become meaningless. Mr Ratelbands case had been referred to a court in the city of Arnhmen in the eastern Dutch provice of Gelderland. He was born on March , , but says he feels at least  years younger and wants to change his birth date to March , . Mr Ratelband said: I have done a check-up and what does it show  My biological age is  years.  When Im , I am limited. If Im , then I can buy a new house, drive a dferent car. I can take up more work. When Im on Tinder and it say Im , I dont get an answer. When Im , with the face I have, I will be in a luxurious position. Transgenders can now have their gender changed on their birth certicate, and in the same spirit there should be room for an age change. He claims he is discriminated against because of his age, and that he encounters problems in society on a daily basis. He said companies are reluctant to hire someone the age of a pensioner as a consultant. And he said his move would also be good news for the government as he would be renouncing his pension until he reaches retirement age again. The judge said that he had some sympathy with Mr Ratelband, but the court said there would be practical problems in allowing people to change their birth date - as it would mean legally deleting part of their lives.

The eldest of four children, she was educated at Norwich High School for Girls, and then she found work as a governess.She didnt become a nurse until she was -years-old, and inspired by the experience of caring for her seriously ill father. After successfully nursing him back to health Edith applied to train as a nurse probationer at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.She went on to have an illustrious medical career both in hospitals and as a private travelling nurse.Edith worked in Shoreditch, Kings Cross and Manchester before moving to Brussels in .

Unfortunately, Ediths activities didnt escape the attention of the German authorities, and she was eventually arrested and charged with treason.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that.

It’s back to five points with a game in hand and there are good teams in this league so you never know what can happen.”Christie was a colossus at centre-back for Fraserburgh, despite playing with a knee injury.He added: “I’m getting a knee operation on December , but the knee is holding up alright. The physio has done a lot of work on it and it’s good I’m managing to play.“I think it showed our squad strength to win because we had six players out and a lot of them would play most weeks.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13664076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS169410821.jpg","title":"cctv cameras blink another ayrshire","story":"NewsCCTV cameras on blink at ANOTHER Ayrshire hospital following stabbing at Ayrs AilsaThe Ayrshire Post can reveal that the Ailsa is not the only Ayrshire hospital where cameras are not recording.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  NOV NewsDetectives scour the scene at the Ailsa Hospital \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSecurity cameras at MORE than one Ayrshire hospital have gone dark, it can be revealed. It follows a kne attacker plunging terror through the health network at the Ailsa Hospital. The wooly-hatted suspect remains at large after escaping past CCTV cameras switched off for  years. Community worker Donna Maxwell, , was stabbed en route to her car on Thursday morning. Now the Post can reveal cameras are also out of order at Girvan Community Hospital – a building shared by the town’s police. Police are still hunting the Ailsa suspect, understood to be a patient at the unit. But they have been forced to launch a desperate appeal for dashcam footage caught on nearby motors. The frantic search has failed to produce a result – despite the alleged culprit being known to Ailsa staff.  One NHS source told the Post: “The woman who did this is no stranger to staff at the hospital. “She had requested to speak to a particular person on Thursday and was told they weren’t there. “That seemed to agitate her and when she got outside she carried out this random attack in the car park. “Luckily she didn’t get any of Donna’s vital organs or this could have been a whole lot worse.” Mum-of-one, Donna, of Irvine, is believed to have stumbled back into the Ailsa after the attack. She was transferred to nearby Ayr Hospital for treatment. Both the Ailsa and Ayr Hospital were put on lockdown as police dog teams raced to the scene and a force chopper circled the skies. And despite an arrest on an “unrelated matter” being made later that night, police admitted on Tuesday the suspect had not been caught. A force spokeswoman said: “There has been no arrest and inquiries are ongoing.” Donna, who was released from hospital on Friday, is now recovering at home.  Husband Tom, , said: “She is very tired and sore. Everything is a bit raw at the moment. “We have been asked by the police not to say anything about what happened or make any comment.” Now a furious union claims staff and patients have been “misled” by NHS bosses over cameras being turned off. UNISON President Gordon McKay, who worked at Ailsa Hospital for many years, said: “Our first thoughts are for the member of staff and her family. “It is shocking that someone who is dedicated to providing high-quality healthcare to the people of Scotland should be attacked at work. “In the longer term, serious questions need to be asked and answered by senior management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran over why it would appear they were leading patients, relatives and staff in the hospital to believe that CCTV was operating as a safety measure when they knew it wasn’t. “Anyone who takes a decision which misleads people about safety matters must be held to account.” When pressed by this paper, NHS chiefs insisted cameras at all of Ayrshire’s major sites were in working order. However, they were forced to concede cameras at Girvan were “working but not currently recording”. And a spokeswoman admitted: “The analogue CCTV system at Ailsa Hospital has not been operational for a number of years. “We have an ongoing review of how to make best use of CCTV across all our sites.” Scotland’s health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has the hospital within her Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency. She said: “The Scottish Government has been in constant contact with NHS Ayrshire and Arran throughout recent days, and has offered any support that might be required. “The Health Resilience team has also been in touch regarding the site CCTV system. “As the MSP covering the Ayr Ailsa Hospital campus, I have contacted the management of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to seek their assurances that they’re taking all reasonable steps to protect the safety both staff and patients.” Police say the suspect is about ft in to ft in tall and aged -.

Scores of jobs are under threat as bosses battle to save its future. Senior sources say at least  full time posts face the axe amid a financial crisis.  Staff have been given the stark warning by outgoing Principal, Heather Dunk. It comes as the college leaks cash on a costly PFI deal for its campus at Kilwinning. A source said: “Mrs Dunk announced to staff that the college will run out of money in a few short years. “She blamed this entirely on the funding council, the Scottish Government and the PFI at Kilwinning. “In a blatant attempt to essentially threaten staff against pursuing the cost-of-living pay rise, she made clear that at least  full time jobs would need to go to pay to keep the college afloat.” The warning comes as Mrs Dunk prepares to step down in the Spring. And a row has engulfed management as they prepare to appoint her successor. We told last week how the recruitment agency leading the search includes the we of college chair, Willie Mackie. A College spokesman said: “The Principal recently met with all staff to provide an update regarding the financial challenges facing the college due to increased staff costs arising from national bargaining and the excessive costs of the PfI campus in Kilwinning. “The College is working with the Scottish Funding Council to find a solution to the dficult financial position, however,additional funding is not available, the outcome may be the loss of jobs to reduce expenditure. “The Principal continues to update the trade unions, the student association and staff on a regular basis to ensure openness and transparency. “All staff are aware of the challenges the Colleges faces and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, wants to see the college backed by the Scottish Government until the end of its PFI contract. But he said: “Unfortunately, the response I have so far received from the Scottish Government to this request has been negative. “But I will continue to argue the case for additional funding to be allocated to the College in order that their ongoing commitments can be met and the loss of staff avoided.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"famous tower blocks almost certain","story":"NewsFamous tower blocks almost certain to be flattenedThe trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .ShareByStephen Houston:,  NOV Updated:,  NOV NewsThe only towers in South Ayrshire are doomed \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s famous tower blocks are almost certainly to be flattened after a repair bill landed for up to pound MILLION of work. The astonishing figure - which works out at pound, for each flat - is being seen as hopeless to fund. The trio of -storey Riverside Place towers have been a landmark since .   Their destruction will mean the loss of  one-bedroom flats and tenants will have to be farmed out to new homes. An insider at owners South Ayrshire Council said: “The price is too high and unless there is a money miracle, they will come down. “Officials have been taken aback at how much money they need. To save them would be financially ridiculous.” Ironically the council has already sanctioned pound million worth of initial work which has already begun. Housing staff say that to build a brand new flat either on the same riverside site or where in the area is just pound,. Each of the blocks has  homes and  have been deliberately left empty as the scale of repair emerged. One-to-one consultation is to take place with the tenants - most of whom are elderly - over the next six months. Councillors heard about the state of the “essential and advisable” works at a meeting yesterday . These include the removal of the external cladding, existing timber and aluminium windows, and pitched roof covering new insulated render system full rewiring new heating and hot water systems upgrading the sprinkler system and upgrading passenger lts. One long-time tenant told the Post: “If it is going to cost about pound, to build a new flat for me to rent, I have a money saving plan. “Give me pound, and I’ll buy my own we place in Ayr. Job done.” If repairs were sanctioned tenants would need to be decanted for a year. Housing boss Donald Gillies said: “As we consider what happens next with the high flats in Ayr, our tenants will continue to be our focus at all times. That’s why we’re asking councillors to approve a formal consultation where we can sit down on an inidual basis with each and every one of our tenants in Riverside Place and discuss their specic needs and preferences. “If Councillors agree, we’re also seeking approval to appoint two dedicated officers to lead on the consultation and engagement exercise, which would get underway in the new year with a further report to Councillors in June. “It would only be then that any decision on the future of the flats would be taken and tenants would be involved in discussions every step of the way.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13663409.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_231118pets_04JPG.jpg","title":"hopping mad mauchline miss doolittle","story":"NewsHopping mad Mauchline Miss Doolittle issues Christmas pleaPoppy Wyllie owns a whopping  bunnies so she knows a thing or two about caring for them.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  NOV NewsPoppy with guinea pals Ginny and Delilah and cabbage-eating rabbit Jasper. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA hopping mad seven-year-old is warning others that rabbits are pets for le and not just Christmas.

kept ldquoin a manner in keeping with the wishes of the testator, and with their historical connection and association with said regiment.The former burgh council minutes show no indication of a

Apart from the obvious fact that the mention of the word Brexit sends most of us into a state of comatose anger delirium , this would be event TV at its most pointless.Unlike in the sort of debates wersquove become used to over the last few years, held before referendums and general elections - and indeed most of the shows it would replace in the schedules - no one other than the MPs watching would have a vote.Adding to the futility surrounding this set-up are the Brexit stances of the only two politicians invited to take part: barring a major change of heart, the positions being argued by Mrs May and Mr Corbyn would not only be similar, but similarly bad.The irony of all this is staggering. Here you have Mrs May, who voted Remain, trying to ram a terrible Brexit deal through Parliament that will, by her Governmentrsquos own admission, make the country poorer. This bleak halfway house leaves the UK worse off in every way, with no control or say over EU policy, having to align itself regardless, while losing all the benefits of the Single Market.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, a lelong Eurosceptic who claims he voted Remain, has taken his party to a bizarre, opaque and convoluted position that also has us leaving the EU, despite knowing full well this will cause genuine and serious harm to the very people and public services he has spent his political le trying to protect from Tory policy. He agrees with Mrs May on ending free movement and leaving the Single Market, his only real ergence from her being the continual peddling of the fantasy that the EU would give him a far better deal than it gave her. Just because hersquos Jezza, you understand.In some ways, you can see why Mrs May, never a natural performer on this type of , would nevertheless want to take part in a debate. Donrsquot think for a minute itrsquos about persuading the public to support her deal ndash we have no say. No, as is usually the case with the Tories, this is all about selling it to a faction, in this case the grassroots party membership, who she wants to pressure their MPs to vote with, rather than against, her.As for Mr Corbyn, who in another striking similarity with the PM is also a poor public communicator, Irsquom still trying to work out what he thinks he can get out of this exposure.And thatrsquos whyI was Nicola Sturgeon, Irsquod stay well out of it and let these two lame ducks go it alone. For now, at least.The First Minister, who is not only an excellent debater but has a clear and cogent position on Brexit, says she wants in on the action, to put the case for staying in the Single Market and or having a so-called Peoplersquos Vote.Like many, I share her concerns around Scotland being deliberately left out of the process, as her lack of an invite to the debate only highlights. But I honestly donrsquot think she should waste her time with this one.If and when the Peoplersquos Vote, or even another general election is called, both of which are possible scenarios, her voice will be needed to persuade not only Scots, but arguably more importantly voters around the UK, that Brexit can and must be stopped or at least signicantly watered down. In that scenario she should not only debate Mrs May and Mr Corbyn but be ready to make her case against hard Brexiteers like Boris Johnson.Until a meaningful opportunity arises, however, Ms Sturgeon should keep her powder clean and let Mrs May and Mr Corbyn keep fighting the phony war."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9105685.jpg?type=article-full","title":"david-mundell-to-tell-banks-that-brexit-deal-offers-clarity","story":"The Scottish Secretary will try to sell Theresa Mayrsquos deal at a briefing for Scotlandrsquos poundbn financial services sector in Edinburgh.:David Mundell faces cross-party calls to resignAmong the employers taking part will be RBS, Tesco Bank, Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, KPMG, Pheonix Group, and CYBG, which owns Clydesdale Bank, Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money UK.Also attending is Scottish Financial Enterprise, the body representing Scotlandrsquos financial services industry, whose members employ more than , people.The SNP said Mr Mundell must be ldquocompletely deludedhe believed his own spin, and said Mrs Mayrsquos deal and political agreement offered only uncertainty on trade relations.SNP MP Tommy Sheppard said: ldquoIf David Mundell is so confident in the Tory governmentrsquos dodgy deal, hersquoll put his neck on the line and resignit fails to pass through the Commons.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond.

We need a deal, we need an orderly exit from the EU and we need certainty.“Like business more generally – and I think the public – they want to see MPs reducing uncertainty, stopping chaos and further ision, concluding a deal and allowing business to move forward.”: Brexit: I’ll still have a job in two weeks, Theresa May insistsDismissing the possibility of renegotiating the deal, he said: “No deal is the most-likely alternative to there being a deal.“Anyone who votes against the deal is increasing the prospect of there being a no deal and I can’t understand how anyone can contemplate that given the disastrous impact it would have on Scotland.”Asked about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s calls for extending theof Article , Mr Mundell replied: “I don’t see any circumstances where Article  should be extended. It’s just extending the uncertainty, the ision and the confusion.“I can see quite clearly that’s something that would appeal to Nicola Sturgeon because she’s now promoting a no-deal scenario because she believes that chaos and ision is the best backdrop for having another independence referendum.”With pressure mounting on the Prime Minister ahead of next Tuesday’s vote, Mr Mundell refused to be drawn on whether Mrs May’s premiership would survivethe deal was rejected in Parliament.“Wider speculation isn’t in any way helpful,” he said. “It’s a big week, there’s going to be five full days of debate.“I’m confident, still, that we can get the deal through next week.”With eight days to go until the vote,  Conservative MPs have said publicly they will vote against Mrs May’s deal and  Tory MPs have said they will not vote in favour.

It has an historic treaty giving it clout within the British state.It has “the world’s most powerfully devolved parliament”. Supposedly.Yet the nation of Scotland has no distinctive say over Brexit at all. Not just in EU negotiations about the most important issue affecting Scots since the independence vote, in which we had total authority. But Scotland also has no presence in deciding what happens next, even though our First Minister has outlined the solutions suddenly discovered by others for two years and has visibly tried to coax common cause from Westminster parties who should have been doing that democratic donkey work themselves. We all understand Britain is a uniquely one-singer one-song kind of democracy, where supposedly powerful devolved legislatures have as little clout as the official opposition. But the determination to side-line Scottish input is fairly jaw-dropping. Former Tory Minister Nick Boles has come up with Norway Now - the wheeze staying in the customs union and single market. Wasn’t that the main proposal in the Scottish Government’s options paper published in December   Still, who cares. It’s a iant of everyday sexism “That’s a marvellous idea, Miss Sturgeon. I’m sure one of the men will have it presently.” Except Nicola Sturgeon’s air-brushing from the Brexit debate has little to do with her gender and everything to do with her nationality. • : Nicola Sturgeon heads to London in bid to force Brexit delayIt’s the same story with the forthcoming “Grand Brexit Debate” between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn. An opinion poll suggests voters want more shades of opinion included than an hour’s face off between two supporters of similarly unworkable Brexit schemes.But the names proposed by commentators as “must have” supplements to the debate are Lib Dem Vince Cable, Green Caroline Lucas and the un-elected Nigel Farage. Apparently, the First Minister may be on a side  – but that’s it. Even though as deputy SNP leader Keith Brown points out “Up to six options for the UK’s future will be voted on in the Commons on December . To fully debate only the Prime Minister’s view and that of the leader of the opposition … would be a severe dereliction of the BBC’s public duty.”Well quite.But doubtless this is exactly what will happen. Which raises a few questions. Why are broadcasters are still intent on delivering a two-person debate despite their relative lack of disagreement and the complexity and importance of the subject Has the business of creating articially polarised debates become such an ingrained habit that broadcasters can do nothing  and believe voters are scared of options  Secondly, is it alright to sideline Britain’s third largest party  The BBC says SNP MPs don’t represent the whole of Britain. Why should that remove all broadcasting rights  Ukip doesn’t actually have any MPs, yet broadcasters will doubtless consider their inclusion because they want a good rammy. Somehow rules will be bent to include Ukip’s viewpoint, but not that of Nicola Sturgeon – although she is both the leader of Britain’s second largest party by membership and the First Minister of Scotland, representing the second largest nation within the UK. But her case for inclusion in formal debates regularly fails to find a champion on British TV. Wrong leaves on the democratic line, folks. Even though, this week the degree of democratic exclusion is set to heighten several notches.Not only will the House of Commons have a stand off over the government’s failure to publish legal guidance, but two other signicant things look set to happen.European judges in Luxembourg are set to rule on whether MPs can unilaterally vote to halt Article . This is a vital component of the People’s Vote, because drafting another referendum will need some time. The case is an excellent example of joint working between Scottish MPs, MSPs and Euro MPs from dferent parties but was begun by two legally minded parliamentarians – Joanna Cherry MP and Andy Wightman MSP. Yet I’ll be surprisedeither gets much airtime, eventheir case is upheld by European judges. The Scottish dimension just muddies the supposedly calm waters of British democracy too much. Even though this week will see another unprecedented outbreak of cross-party Scottish cooperation in Holyrood, where a joint statement from the four progressive parties will call for MSPs to reject both a no-deal Brexit and Theresa May’s compromise deal as “damaging for Scotland and the nations and regions of the UK”. In short, Scottish Labour and Lib Dems can go where their British counterparts fear to tread. Yet this move will probably get no network coverage at all.It seems Nicola Sturgeon could do the political equivalent of throwing herself under a horse at the Derby for the good of British voters and the news channels would hardly notice. This tells Scottish voters a lot about the reality of devolution. Power devolved has indeed turned out to be power retained by Westminster. The UK has turned out not to be a union but a unitary state, where devolved power is retrieved when convenient and no-one but the Conservative Partygets any say on major decisions over trade and foreign policy. I’ve lost count of the radio and TV discussions in which no question about Scotland’s response to Brexit is even raised. Yet voicing such an opinion sounds naïve at best and whining at worst. Meanwhile some broadcasters suggest the public is experiencing Brexit fatigue. Does this mean a terrible outcome must be tolerated simply because British parliamentary democracy has evaded, stupefied and bored the public into submission  We should beware these siren voices and remember Iraq where the voices of caution who wanted hard evidence of WMD were cast aside in the rush to action. There is still time to do better, but the role of Scots in formulating a rescue plan will never get the credit it deserves. Britain is essentially a unitary state, politically incapable of becoming anything . This is the reality of our constitutional position as revealed by the political stress-testing of Brexit. The question is whether Scots should sail on, regardless of the massive crack now visible,to shore and forget the escape attempt or look urgently for a brand new vessel. How the next few weeks are handled will have a massive impact in the forthcoming indyref debate.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4837290.1543669277!/image/image.jpg","title":"outlander s craig mcginlay on rugby acting and teamwork","story":"From blending with Beckham to hanging with Sam Heughan, the Scottish actor is on the moveCraig McGinlay is going places. He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything.

Mrs May will today tell MPs that the public withdrew their consent for pooling sovereignty with the EU, and must have their wishes delivered through a Brexit deal.“Ultimately, membership of any union can only be sustained with the consent of the people,” the Prime Minister will say.“In the referendum of , the biggest democratic exercise in our history, the British public withdrew that consent. They confirmed that choice a year later by voting overwhelmingly for parties that committed to delivering Brexit.“The referendum was a vote to bring our EU membership to an end and to create a new role for our country in the world.”Mrs May will claim that only her deal can deliver an end to free movement of people while delivering “an unprecedented economic relationship that no other major economy has”.“The British people want us to get on with a deal that honours the referendum,” the Prime Minister will say. “This is the deal that delivers for the British people.”With around  Conservative MPs saying they could vote against the deal, the odds are stacked against the government. Labour has said it will bring a motion of no confidence in the governmentit is defeated, which could bring about a general election. Mrs May’s DUP allies have hinted they could abandon her in the event of a confidence vote.Opposition MPs are also set to push for a second EU referendumthe Brexit deal collapses.Meeting Mrs May last night for the second time in two weeks, Ms Sturgeon appealed for a plan B and pledged to work with other parties to delay Brexit by extending Article  – something Downing Street ruled out yesterday.Following the meeting in Mrs May’s Commons office, the First Minister insisted that next week’s vote “cannot – and must not – be a  choice between [the Prime Minister’s] proposed deal and a no-deal outcome, which threatens to be utterly disastrous.”Ms Sturgeon added: “The SNP will lay our amendment to the meaningful vote later this week and we will continue to work with others to build consensus around alternative proposals that would deliver on the vote of the people of Scotland to remain.“With the UK government’s own published figures now making clear that any kind of Brexit would make us all poorer, the time has come for all those who oppose the extreme Brexit championed by the right-wing of the Tory party to come together and make a stand.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “The Prime Minister spoke about the support she has received from fishermen, farmers and business leaders – like Sir Ian Wood – who back the deal as it gives them the clarity and certainty they need to protect jobs and living standards.”Over the coming days in the Commons, Mrs May will deploy senior Cabinet ministers to make the case, with Chancellor Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid expected to appear at the despatch box.The first day of debate will be closed by Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who faced embarrassment yesterday after appearing not to know when the UK is leaving the EU.Giving evidence to MPs on the Brexit committee, Mr Barclay, who took over the role last month after the resignation of Dominic Raab, said Britain was quitting the bloc on  March, rather than the actual date of  March.Tomorrow’s debate will focus on security, while Thursday’s debate will be on the economy.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

While a full list of attendees is not available it is probable that he was at the founding meeting of Sinn Féin in November . In  O’Kelly was appointed editor of the Leinster Leader in Naas, County Kildare.

He welcomed republicans to his home during the annual Wolfe Tone commemorations in nearby Bodenstown. O’Kelly’s first book of stories was published in  and his first play was produced the following year.

In  the Women’s Social and Political Union was founded in England and the militant feminists commenced the battle for the vote. In Ireland there had been groups working for women’s suffrage but the campaign really began here on the instigation of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington and Margaret Cousins. Margaret Cousins came from a unionist family in Dublin but she later wrote: “I belonged in my heart from the beginning to the fighters for freedom.” Her husband James Cousins also rejected the unionism of his background and became involved in the Gaelic revival. Margaret came into contact with the women’s movement in England in . On herto Ireland she co-operated with a remarkable young woman who was to make her mark on Irish history. Hanna Sheehy was the daughter of a Fenian, David Sheehy, who took part in the  Rising and was elected as a Parnellite MP in . Hanna was an exceptional student and excelled academically despite the restrictions on women’s access to education she achieved a first class honours MA in . She became a teacher and married Francis Skeffington. In line with their shared feminist principles they adopted each other’s surnames. Francis resigned his post as registrar of University College because the authorities refused to register women on the same basis as men. In  Hanna and Margaret founded the Irish Women’s Franchise League , with the active support of both Francis Sheehy Skeffington and James Cousins. From the beginning they stressed that the IWFL would address the specic needs of Irish women in “a subject country seeking freedom from England” and would “work on independent Irish lines”. Margaret Cousins described the IWFL’s position: “Its policy was to educate by all forms of propaganda the men, women and children of Ireland to understand and support the members of the League in their demand for votes for women, and to obtain pledges from every Irish Member of Parliament to vote for Women’s Suffrage Bills introduced in the British Houses of Parliament, and to include Women’s Suffrage in any Irish Home Rule Bill.” The IWFL campaigned throughout the country and made an impact beyond their numbers of about  activists. Not all militant women agreed with the IWFL’s tactics the republican group Inghinidhe na hÉireann refused to join in lobbying the British parliament, preferring to “organise a women’s movement on Sinn Féin lines, or on lines even broader still”. Despite this dference, republican women such as Constance Markievicz played an active role in the IWFL’s work and Hanna Sheehy Skeffington herself was strongly republican. Markievicz urged young Irishwomen to prepare to fight: “Arm yourselves with weapons to fight your nation’s cause. Arm your souls with noble and free ideas. Arm your minds with the histories and memories of your country and her martyrs, her language, and a knowledge of her arts and industries. Andin your day the call should come for your body to arm, do not shirk from that either.” Markievicz said Irishwomen were “doubly enslaved with a double battle to fight”. Following the  general election the Irish Party at Westminster was in a position to press the Liberal government to publish a Home Rule Bill. But Redmond and his party still refused to support women’s right to vote. The IWFL became more militant and Hanna and Francis founded the Irish Citizen newspaper to further the cause of women’s rights as well as Irish independence, social justice and pacism. When British politicians visited Ireland they were challenged by the IWFL. Margaret ‘Meg’ Connery confronted British Tory leader Andrew Bonar Law and Unionist leader Edward Carson when they came to Dublin. In Belfast Hanna Sheehy Skeffington challenged Winston Churchill. Margaret Cousins joined protests in England in  and was jailed for a month. In June  eight women from the IWFL smashed windows in Dublin Castle and other prominent buildings. Hanna was arrested at the Castle and she and the seven others were imprisoned in Mountjoy. The following month British Prime Minister Asquith visited Dublin and there were more protests. Three English feminists had followed Asquith to Ireland and they were also jailed for their protests. After a hunger strike in Mountjoy by the English suffragists and the IWFL women, all were released except two of the Englishwomen who were subjected to forced feeding. Many meetings of the IWFL were physically attacked at this time by Redmondites who saw the campaign for women’s suffrage as a threat to their political dominance and their relationship with the British Liberal government. In contrast, republicans such as Pádraig Mac Piarais and Thomas MacDonagh were supporters of the IWFL. The IWFL also won the support of prominent trade unionists James Larkin and James Connolly. They were closely allied with the Irish Women Workers Union in Liberty Hall and in  Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed after a confrontation with the Dublin politan Police during the Great Lockout. She was released after a six-day hunger strike. That year also saw the death in England of feminist Emily Davison who ran on to the course at the Epsom Derby and was trampled by a race horse. Hanna Sheehy Skeffington was jailed again in  for campaigning against recruitment to the British Army. Her influence and that of the IWFL was seen in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic of  which enshrined women’s right to vote. Her friend James Connolly told her: “You will be glad to know that in the Proclamation of the Irish Republic we are including equal citizenship for women.” Hanna replied that she knew who was responsible, meaning Connolly himself. “We were practically unanimous, Only one questioned it,” replied Connolly. Francis Sheehy Skeffington was murdered in Portobello Barracks by a British Army officer during the Easter Rising. Hanna embarked on a tour of the United States to expose the truth about the murder and other British atrocities. She continued to play a leading role in the struggle for Irish freedom, as did many of the pioneering feminists of the IWFL. In  the IWFL saw its central aim achieved when women voted for the first time in the general election which resulted in a massive Sinn Féin victory, although women under  were still excluded. The IWFL actively opposed British rule and supported Dáil Éireann. For example in August  Hanna was badly beaten by the RIC who attacked a Sinn Féin meeting at which she spoke in Kilbeggan, Co. Westmeath. IWFL women went on to champion women’s rights in the decades following the Treaty when they faced the very dferent challenges of a partitioned Ireland with conservative anti-women governments North and South. The Irish Women’s Franchise League was founded  years ago on  November .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27493  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonA wreckers’ agenda is being driven by the DUP and Tory government.

They must not be allowed to destroy the democratic option formaking change in the north.It is these circumstances which bring sharply into focus theIrish governments responsibilities.Those who courageously signed this letter to the Irish government are saying the negative position of the DUP and British governmentmust not be tolerated.These are citizens who want the political institutionsre-established but only on the basis of democracy and equality.They are assertive in their resolve to see a rights basedsociety created, which guarantees rights, respect, and parity of esteem, in ashared, inclusive future.But they are not prepared to be treated as second-classcitizens in this part of Ireland.Those days are over.It is time for the Irish Government to indeed redouble itsefforts to step up to the mark by absolutely opposing the imposition ofBrexit, and guaranteeing equality and rights for all citizens in the north.An Taoiseach and the Irish Government needs to reflect verycarefully about the signicance and timing of this intervention, respondpositively and act decisively, in cooperation with the politicalrepresentatives of Irish citizens, and others in the north, to ensure thattheir democratic rights are delivered upon.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27494  ","story":"• th NOVEMBER  - Newly elected Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams Mícheál Mac DonnchaTHE Ard Fheis of  marked a signicant stage in the political development of Sinn Féin. The historic gathering came in the wake of the campaign in support of the H-Block and Armagh prisoners, the epic Hunger Strikes, the intervention of prisoner candidates, North and South, in  and Sinn Féin’s electoral rise in the Six Counties in  and .The party’s performance in the October  Assembly elections – when five republicans were elected to the body set up by British direct ruler Jim Prior – caused alarm to the SDLP and their supporters in the Establishment parties in the  Counties. Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

The pair of Sir Knights enjoyed their first mock battle between King William and King James, in their respective roles, during the summer.Craig, from Richhill, admits the Scarva showpiece is a particular personal highlight, having assumed such office.He said: “I enjoy the interaction and opportunity to meet other people. We were fortunate to have been invited by the outgoing Lord Mayor to launch the Thirteenth, and promote our official charity. It is very rewarding to walk in front of the banner at Scarva, after months of planning, seeing all the spectators and Sir Knights enjoying themselves, with preferably nice weather!”The project coordinator, who only recently got married, acknowledges the extra responsibility of preparing for one of the flagship events of the parading season.“There’s a lot of meetings! We liaise with ious stakeholders in order to make the day possible, which means a lot of evenings are taken up, especially the closer we get to July. I must admit, I didnt appreciate the work that goes into organising the event until I was elected into office. “The deputy master and I are only two cogs of the wheel though, as there is a dedicated team who work tirelessly, giving up their time without any hesitation to put on the best parade of the year. “However, when you hit the Demesne, and see the tens of thousands of people enjoying themselves, it makes it all worth it.” Craig maintains he and Andrew have a close bond, having a shared interest in sport, and more importantly both “wanting the best for the preceptory”.As for their partnership demystying the perception that the Royal Black is an “older man’s” organisation, Craig retorts: “Yes, I would say so. I know many of my friends are all active members throughout the organisation. For those that argue it is an old mans organisation, I would say, join, get involved and help change that perception.”Andrew, from Donaghmore, said he enjoyed holding office with the Scarva preceptory.“There are not many preceptories with a young leadership like RBP  but it’s important to have experience from the older members to guide us in our decisions and actions,” he said.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson: Libya trade envoy role ‘very interesting’Temperatures set to plummet tonight Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“If the presence of Craig and myself encourages younger people to join the Institution, then that can only be a positive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"four generations during four decades","story":"JOHN Paul II Youth Club in Ardoyne was founded in  amidst violence that would mark the year as one of the bloodiest of the recent conflict.The youth club’s first home was in a disused shop on Herbert Street, just yards from where a number of nationalist were burnt out of their homes just a few years earlier.Jacqui Maguire, a senior youth worker at John Paul II, was just nine years old when she attended the club’s first ever event on Halloween night in its formative year, and has been involved with the club ever since.Reflecting on those early days, Jacqui recalled how, in the hardest of times, local people rallied to provide a safe haven for young people who needed refuge from regular rioting and shootings on the nearby Crumlin Road.“The kids needed social interaction, but they were getting out of school and then going into the house because of the shooting and the rioting,” she explained.“There was an old shop that they cleared out and used for discos and wee parties.“The word went about that there was a youth club opening and everybody came from everywhere. In the beginning it was just used as a place for the kids in the street to play, but it just got bigger and bigger.“It was used as a nursery and mothers would meet there at night-time. It was like a social club rather than a youth club.“At the time Mr McLaughlin in St Gabriel’s said there werelads at the school who needed apprenticeships, so he would have brought them down and they were doing a bit bricklaying and plumbing and cleaned up the building.”Despite its less-than-humble beginnings, Jacqui’s early memories of the youth club are happy ones of a community that did its best in dficult circumstances. She recalls discos in Herbert Street, sports competitions and – despite it being the height of the Troubles – cross-community trips away. It was also those formative years that set Jacqui on the path to youth work. “Every night there was something dferent going on,” she recalled.“We also went on cross community trips, and we went to Cork with Cedar Lodge Youth Club. We used to go to Cork in the week of July. Later on we would have gone to Donegal. It was really a way to keep us off the streets.”She continued: “The club got us to do wee junior committees, got us to volunteer and help the young ones, and it stopped us being out there causing trouble. That’s the way we run this club as well. There are all dferent age groups that help with the younger ones. It’s called peer leading now, but it wouldn’t have been called that in those days.”Moving from an old disused shop to two burnt-out houses in the area that were renovated, the youth club eventually got its own purpose built building, which was opened by Liverpool and Ireland player Steve Heighway in . That came after local people, including Jacqui’s father Owen Maguire, and her late mother Bridie Maguire, lobbied the then Secretary of State, Lord Melchett, to obtain £, in funding for the club’s new home.While kids with few other facilities flocked to John Paul II Youth Club in its early days, the club has only grown since then. Two years ago a new extension was built at the club and plans are already under way to build a new amphitheatre and all-purpose sports pitch in early .John Paul II Youth Club has been an integral part of the lives of many people in Ardoyne. Jacqui represents just one of four generations of her family who are currently involved with the club and said its growth is a real source of pride to her.“It’s hard to believe that a group of women way back in the s even knew about social policy, or knew how to take those steps to build a club,” she said.“I will also say that it has been the members and the community that have been the backbone of the club. We could see what it did for us and we want to make sure pass that on to the next generation and the generations after that.“It’s a safe haven for the kids. Our young people know they can come in and there is enough staff of dferent ages and dferent levels for them to work with them. Young people will have particular staff that they will really gel with. We have a lot of programmes, a lot of personal development, a lot of buddy programmes, but it doesn’t all have to be high-flying – sometimes it can just be sitting down with somebody to talk.”Like all community groups, John Paul II Youth Club has had its challenges, particularly in the area of funding. However, volunteer hours, care and hard work from staff members combine to keep the club open six days a week. For the young people, the outcome is better social lives, learning opportunities, and the instilling of a strong set of values amongst which empathy is to the fore.“Our motto is sharing is caring,” Jacqui said.“They learn acceptance and understanding of others. It doesn’t matter who they are or what they are – you respect them. It doesn’t matter what anybody’s issues are, you always give them a second chance, because we can all mess up first chances.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"storm diana set to batter the north","story":"THE tail end of Storm Diana is set to sweep across the north todaywith strong winds of up to mph in some places.A yellow warning has been put in place by the Met Office from am to midnight.The warning adds that some delays to public transport are likely and some journey times could take longer.

Brexit backstop could continue indefinitely, Government legal advice suggests Brexit: What do the Government’s legal position papers say  Opposition parties complained, after a fractious two-and-a-half-hour debate, that the summary legal advice released by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox did not comply with a Commons resolution agreed on November . Mr Cox, who is the Governments chief legal adviser, had staunchly defended the decision - telling MPs \"there is nothing to see here\". The Speaker however, in a statement to the Commons, said he was \"satisfied\" the matter should be put before MPs to consider on Tuesday morning. He said: \"The letter that I received from the members mentioned at the start of this statement asks me to give precedence to a motion relating to privilege in relation to the failure of ministers to comply with the terms of the resolution of the House of the  November.\" Mr Bercow stopped his statement to scold Government chief whip Julian Smith, who was talking to ministers on the frontbench, saying: \"It would seem courteoushe could just hold off for a moment and allow me to make the statement that would appear to show perhaps a proper politeness.\" He added: \"I have considered the matter carefully and I am satisfied that there is an arguable case that a contempt has been committed. Im therefore giving precedence for a motion to be tabled tonight before the House rises and to be taken as first business tomorrow.\" Mr Bercow said it was \"entirely for the House to decide on that motion\". The Attorney General earlier said that he \"fully accepts\" MPs may impose a sanction against him or the Government for contempt of Parliament over Brexit legal advice. He said: \"The House has at its disposal the means by which to enforce its will. \"It can bring a motion of contempt and seek to have that motion passed and seek to impose through the committee, or whichever way it is appropriately done, to impose a sanction. I fully accept that. \"I dont set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.\" Mr Cox had asked MPs to suppose the advice included details on relationships with foreign states and arguments that might be deployed in the future, noting: \"Would it be right for the Attorney General, regardless of the harm to the public interest, to ulge his opinion. \"I say it wouldnt.\" Mr Cox said it would be dficult to ensure information would be redacted, adding: \"I cannot take a step that I firmly and truly believe would be contrary to the public interest\". He went on: \"I ask the House to understand that it is only that consideration that is motivating me and this Government in declining at this stage to break the convention that applies to both sides of the House when they are in government. \"There is nothing to see here.\""},{"url":null,"title":"backstop is uncomfortable necessity says may adviser as legal papers are released","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

backstop “protocol”, which would see the whole of the UK enter into a customs arrangement with the EU, would come into effect in December  “in the event that a subsequent agreement is not in place by then, and the protocol will continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole in or part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements”.However, it goes on to say that “ it does start to apply then it should do so only temporarily”.The document was released ahead of statements to MPs due to be made by the Prime Minister and the Government’s chief legal officer, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, on Monday afternoon.Ive got a deal that delivers what people voted for.Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit vision. pic LkUbeInV— This Morning🎄December , Earlier Mrs May’s chief Brexit adviser told MPs that the Northern Ireland border backstop was a “slightly uncomfortable necessity” for both the UK and the European Union.The fallback plan agreed with Brussels was “not the future relationship that either the UK or the EU wants to have with one another”, Olly Robbins told the Exiting the European Union Committee.He said: “It is an uncomfortable position for both

border backstop provision in the Brexit deal could continue indefinitely “unless and until it is superseded” by a new agreement, according to Government legal advice..pushThe position statement released on Monday also said the UK faces paying extra money to the European Unionthe implementation period after the March departure date has to be extended.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said he would have preferred the UK to be able to unilaterally terminate the backstop arrangement, while Theresa May’s chief Europe adviser Olly Robbins admitted the situation was “uncomfortable”.The backstop is highly controversial, with Brexiteer MPs claiming it traps the UK into obeying rules set by Brussels without a say over them.The -page Legal Position On The Withdrawal Agreement was published after the Government lost a parliamentary vote calling for the full legal advice to be released.Opposition parties in the Commons – including Theresa May’s DUP allies –  said the document and a statement by Mr Cox failed to meet the terms of the vote and asked Speaker John Bercow to launch contempt of Parliament proceedings.The row came after Theresa May told Tory MPs to “hold their nerve” and back her Brexit deal, insisting she would still have a job in two weeks’ time as she faces a crunch December  Commons vote on her EU Withdrawal Agreement.The dense legalese paper states the backstop “protocol”, which would take the whole of the UK into a customs arrangement with the EU to avoid a hard border with Ireland, would come into effect in December  unless an alternative measure was in place.The document said “in the event that a subsequent agreement is not in place by then” the “protocol will continue to apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole in or part, by a subsequent agreement establishing alternative arrangements”.It goes on to say “ it does start to apply then it should do so only temporarily”, with Mr Cox arguing the Article  process for leaving the EU does not allow a permanent arrangement to be put in place.Mr Cox acknowledged neither the UK nor the EU had the right to terminate the backstop agreement unilaterallyit came into effect, eventalks on a future trade deal to replace it broke down.“I make no bones about it – I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in this backstop,” he told MPs.He added: “I’m prepared to lend my support to this agreement because I do not believe that we’re likely to be entrapped in it permanently.”In a letter to the Speaker, signed by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds and senior MPs from the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party, the Government was accused of failing to comply with the vote ordering the publication of the advice.Sir Keir said: “The Government has failed to publish the Attorney General’s full and final legal advice to the Cabinet, as ordered by Parliament.“We have therefore been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt.”Ive got a deal that delivers what people voted for.Prime Minister Theresa May on her Brexit vision. pic LkUbeInV— This

I fully accept that. “I don’t set myself up contrary to the House, I simply say that I cannot compromise the public interest.”Mr Cox had asked MPs to suppose the advice included details on relationships with foreign states and arguments that might be deployed in the future, noting: “Would it be right for the Attorney General, regardless of the harm to the public interest, to ulge his opinion.“I say it wouldn’t.”Nobody should confuse a very long statement from Cox, with Parliament getting what it unanimously agreed to on a binding motion, namely, the full and final legal advice from the Attorney General to the Cabinet.— Labour WhipsDecember , Mr Cox said it would be dficult to ensure information would be redacted, adding: “I cannot take a step that I firmly and truly believe would be contrary to the public interest”.He went on: “I ask the House to understand that it is only that consideration that is motivating me and this Government in declining at this stage to break the convention that applies to both sides of the House when they are in government.“There is nothing to see here.”There were farcical scenes in the Commons later as Tory MPs piled into the chamber to extend the final debate on Scotland’s foreign policy footprint in an apparent bid to enable them to table an amendment to the contempt motion before the House adjourned for the day.SNP MP Chris Lawnoted there was a “filibuster to the world’s end” while colleague Carol Monaghansaid the UK Government was “dependent on talking about Scotland to save their necks”.Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan received a pat on the back from ministerial colleague Harriett Baldwin after taking a pause during his -minute speech.Sir Alan would normally be expected to speak for  minutes in response to an adjournment debate."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on uk businesses","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, growth was among the lowest recorded over the past two and a half years.The survey showed that the growth in new orders came primarily from the UK domestic market with new product launches and companies stockpiling ahead of Britain’s departure from the European Union.But orders from overseas dropped for the second consecutive month in November, which IHS said was the first back-to-back contraction since early  as Brexit uncertainty took a toll on companies.Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, which compiles the survey, said: “The November PMI provided a lacklustre picture of the UK manufacturing sector, as ongoing global trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty weighed on current business conditions and dampened the outlook for the year ahead.”He said the survey suggests manufacturing output is on course to make “no contribution to GDP growth in the final quarter, with a clear risk of output contracting unless December proves a stronger month”.“While demand from the domestic market was a positive spur, in some cases as clients built up stocks in response to Brexit and other supply-chain uncertainties, manufacturers also reported a further decrease in new export business as slower global economic growth and Brexit worries took a bite out of foreign demand.“Brexit worries also increasingly dominated the outlook for the sector. Although still forecasting growth for the year ahead, manufacturers’ confidence fell to its lowest ebb since August .”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said, with overseas demand fragile, the manufacturing sector “does not have a buffer to withstand any lurch down in the domestic economy caused either by a no-deal Brexit or intensying fears that this worst case might happen”."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37580704.ece/43a49/AUTOCROP/w620h342/supppic3.jpg","title":"dups foster could be open to norway plus deal to satisfy dups red line on brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say december","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia.

Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town. This is an extremely serious issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9122102.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Pregnant women were enrolled to the study between  and .The authors examined the levels of chemicals in the mothers during pregnancy and children when they were nine years old.The study, which examined  girls and  boys, then tracked onset of puberty.Researchers found no association between chemical exposure and the start of puberty in boys.But in girls they found links between exposure to certain chemicals and the early onset of puberty.The study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, examined chemical levels including phthalates, parabens and phenols.Certain phthalates are used in some scented products such as perfumes, deodorants, soaps, shampoo, nail polish and cosmetics.Parabens are often used as preservatives in cosmetics and other personal care products and phenols can be used in soap, toothpaste, lipsticks, hairsprays, shampoos and skin lotions.Dr Kim Harley, associate professor in public health at the University of Calornia, who led the study, said: ldquoWe found evidence that some chemicals widely used in personal care products are associated with earlier puberty in girls.ldquoSpecically, we found that mothers who had higher levels of two chemicals in their bodies during pregnancy ndash diethyl phthalate, which is used in fragrance, and triclosan, which is an antibacterial agent in certain soaps and toothpaste ndash had daughters who entered puberty earlier.ldquoWe also found that girls with higher levels of parabens in their bodies at the age of nine entered puberty earlier.ldquoThis is important because we know that the age at which puberty starts in girls has been getting earlier in the last few decades one hypothesis is that chemicals in the environment might be playing a role, and our findings support this idea.ldquoEarlier puberty in girls increases their risk of mental health problems and risk-taking behaviour as teenagers and increases their risk of breast and oian cancer over the long-term, so this is an important issue to address..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Household chemicals linked to early puberty in girls article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

Earlier this year, it was announced that Queen’s Arcade would undergo a major £m facelt. Peter Lunn, chairman of Lunn’s Jewellers, said the decision by Rolex to open in Belfast is “a huge endorsement for the city”. “Rolex is one of the world’s true super-brands and to have their store on Donegall Place, the city’s main retail thoroughfare, is a major expression of confidence. The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade. It represents a big investment in Rolex parts and machinery, but we believe it is an essential part of the authentic Rolex experience.” Richard de Leyser, managing director, Rolex UK, said: “I’m delighted that Lunn’s continues to invest in our partnership and excited at the prospect of expanding the Rolex offering in Queen’s Arcade. “The plans to extend the space dedicated to Rolex and provide a new and engaging customer experience will perfectly position Lunn’s to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing retail environment. “The contemporary space will complement the historic architecture of Queen’s Arcade and provide a fitting home for Rolex.  We are proud to partner Lunn’s in this new development which will further enhance the unrivalled service to our customers in Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said.

And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
