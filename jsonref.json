Photograph: Getty ImagesMost young people say they would consider taking an “earn and learn” apprenticeship as an alternative to the more expensive option of college, new research indicates.However, only a minority – 18 per cent – believe there are currently enough apprenticeship options available to choose from.Ireland has one of the highest proportions of school-leavers progressing to third level in the world, and one of the lowest proportions opting for apprenticeships.The Government is aiming to increase the numbers choosing “earn and learn” options to one in five school-leavers over the coming years.Research, commissioned by the Insurance Institute and undertaken by Empathy Research, surveyed about 300 young adults and just over 365 parents of children under the age of 18 on their perceptions of apprenticeships.The findings were released to mark the launch of the 2019 Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship. The programme, now in its fourth year, was Ireland’s first degree-level apprenticeship and is set to have 100 places on offer this year.It allows apprentices to work full time for an insurance employer, earn a salary, while studying for an honours degree in insurance practice. The findings also show that just over half of parents would encourage their child to undertake an apprenticeship, with a small minority – 12 per cent – believing there are currently enough apprenticeship options available. The vast majority of young adults – 82 per cent – stated that third level education was not for everyone, with a similar proportion agreeing that you can have a successful career without going to college. When asked what their main concerns are with going to college, young adults surveyed cited job prospects when studying is complete, followed by cost and affordability of third-level education. Parents stated that the cost and affordability of college was their main worry, with job prospects also a concern with regards their children’s third-level education. More optionsCommenting on the research findings, Dermot Murray, chief executive of the Insurance Institute, said the results indicated that there was a strong desire for more options in terms of third-level education.“Once again the research also highlights the many concerns young adults and their parents have in relation to third level, with cost and affordability and job prospects high on the agenda again this year.“With an apprenticeship such as ours these fears are alleviated as the programme is government-funded and so the fees are minimal – €600. Also the apprentices have the opportunity to work anywhere in the country as the programme is delivered through online lectures and distance learning, so it truly is nationwide and they may not need to move.”The research also showed some interesting findings in relation to the Leaving Cert.About half young adults say not achieving enough points is their main concern, with most parents most likely to worry about this also. Mental wellbeing is high on the agenda for both parents and young adults, with (40 per cent ) under 34 claiming to give their mental wellbeing a lot of consideration, and seven in 10 parents claiming they consider their children’s mental wellbeing to the same degree.

A €3 billion investment of taxpayers’ money over a 25-30 year time frame to cover the 25 per cent of homes without broadband is an exceptionally large investment and advices such as this cannot and should not be ignored.“I am writing to ask whether there is any advice such as this in your department and if so whether you will publish these advices and responses to same.”Mr Cowen said that as there is “only one bidder left in the process this advice is surely not commercially sensitive”.“Given the extent of the tax payers money involved and given that this was originally estimated to cost the state €500 million I believe it is in the public interest to publish these advices and responses to same before any decision is made.”‘Full transparency’Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin rowed in behind the calls to publish all advice on Sunday after it was reported that the secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure Robert Watt had voiced concerns about the plan.Mr Martin said it is “time for full transparency from the Government in relation to the national broadband plan”.“It’s heading towards being the most expensive National Broadband Plan in the world. It started out at €500 million of a subvention. It’s now gone to €3 billion. Other questions I’ve already raised publicly with the Taoiseach.

That’s not the way to do this,” he said.The British and Irish governments have called all-party talks in Northern Ireland for May 7th and a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference in London for May 8th.Mr Martin was criticised by both the DUP and Sinn Féin for his suggestion, made at the annual Fianna Fáil 1916 Commemoration in Arbour Hill on Sunday. The Fianna Fáil leader told those in attendance he agreed with the SDLP proposition “about the suspension of the petition of concern as a basis for the immediate restoration of the assembly and the executive”.A petition of concern, which requires at least 30 MLAs, triggers a mechanism in the assembly whereby legislation will only pass if it is supported by a weighted majority of members including at least 40 per cent of nationalist and unionist blocks.Marriage equality“This procedure was developed as a means of protecting minority rights and preventing the majority from seeking to undermine the position of the other community,” Mr Martin said. “The use of the petition of concern to block marriage equality or other measures designed to respect rights, not undermine them, is an unquestionable abuse.”DUP MP Ian Paisley jnr said the issue was one for politicians elected in the North.“These are matters entirely within the hands of the people of Northern Ireland via their own elected representatives and would be a matter for local politicians and not for politicians from the Republic,” he said. “One has got to wonder if such interventions on what are clearly strand-one issues are really designed to advance the situation at all or designed to ensure, because of where the suggestions come from, to stagnate any progress locally at all.”Sinn Féin said suspending the petition of concern would not achieve “a long-term solution” and criticised attempts to “unpick” the Belfast Agreement.“The Fianna Fáil leader’s support for this approach is yet another example of him being out of touch with the reasonable expectation of citizens in the North to enjoy the same rights as citizens everywhere else in these islands.”Before Stormont collapsed in January 2017, five motions had been brought forward to the Assembly on same-sex marriage. However, an Assembly vote in favour of extending civil marriage rights to same-sex couples was vetoed by the DUP using the petition-of-concern blocking mechanism.It is expected on Monday that the Ireland’s Future grassroots campaign group will say the delivery of rights such as same-sex marriage, women’s health and the Irish language must be central to any talks process."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3874327.1556469763!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fianna f%C3%A1il seeks removal of dup blocking mechanism on marriage equality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin attending his party’s annual Easter Rising 1916 commemoration at Arbour Hill, Dublin.

However, an assembly vote in favour of extending civil marriage rights to same-sex couples was vetoed by the DUP using the petition-of-concern blocking mechanism.In talks early last year to resolve the political impasse, issues such as same sex marriage and Irish language prevented the parties reaching an agreement.Mr Martin said an “immediate commitment” to hold a referendum on same sex marriage could break the impasse.“We agree with the SDLP proposition about the suspension of the petition of concern as a basis for the immediate restoration of the assembly and the executive.“This procedure was developed as a means of protecting minority rights and preventing the majority from seeking to undermine the position of the other community.“The use of the petition of concern to block marriage equality or other measures designed to respect rights not undermine them is an unquestionable abuse.“An alternative idea, if this would break the logjam, would be an immediate commitment to a referendum on marriage equality which might be a way to deal with the issue.”A petition of concern requires at least 30 MLAs. It triggers a mechanism in the assembly whereby legislation will only pass if it is supported by a weighted majority of members including at least 40 per cent of nationalist and unionist blocks.Mr Martin said a large majority in Westminster could quickly ensure the passage of legislation.“In my view, the institutions should never have been collapsed over the heating scandal. I think when scandals happen in any political system or within any government, you deal with the scandal, you have the inquiry but you don’t collapse parliament and I think that was a fundamental mistake that was made.Mr Martin was speaking at the Fianna Fáil 1916 Commemoration in Arbour Hill on Sunday.He was asked about speculation around a potential election this June. Mr Martin said the country must come first and that we are “not out of the woods” yet in terms of the UK’s departure from the European Union.“As far as we are concerned we took a position before Christmas in terms of the supply and confidence agreement in the context of a no-deal Brexit looming and it was my view that it would have been reckless and irresponsible to plunge the country into an election and months of forming a government.“We are still not out of the woods in terms of Brexit and how the parliament might approach it whatever the Taoiseach’s views are, my view is that the country comes first, not the partisan interest of any political party.“I have made a commitment that we would work towards agreeing a budget, that’s what we agreed to work constructively towards that end. You can’t extend from month to month, that’s what we said and that still holds.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignRape victims told to hand over mobile phones or see attackers walk freeWorkplace stress drives up disability discrimination claims by more than a third, employment law experts saySpain election: Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wins as far-Right makes breakthroughMystery behind \u2028£50k high fashion at charity shopLine of Duty, episode 4, review: Anna Maxwell Martin steals show in battle of HastingsHuawei is legally-obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence services, Jeremy Hunt warns1p and 2p U-turn as Philip Hammond to announce they will no longer be scrappedBritish boy aged 8 becomes world\u0026#39s youngest to be fitted with bionic arm as he celebrated eating with both hands for first timeBritain should eat less red meat, plant millions of trees and build wind turbines, Government advisors to sayTories braced for worst local election losses since 1995 as party chiefs admit they face fury over BrexitJeremy Corbyn faces open revolt over second referendum as Tom Watson appeals directly to Labour activists Comment: Don\u0026#39t take out your Brexit frustrations on our hard-working Tory councillorsSnake\u0026#39s on a bus: Passengers alarmed after serpent boards service in ScotlandConcern councils using drones to snoop on planning extensions as dozens apply for aviation licencesMotorway signs should be redrawn to curb careless driving, transport watchdog warnsPig slaughtering at award winning primary school sparks fury of animal activistsStowe school asks premiership football scouts to help them find under privileged pupilsBack to work in the morning: London runner Hayley Carruthers stumbles into nation\u0026#39s hearts as one of the marathon eliteArmy veteran jailed in Dubai over disputed drugs charges to have his plight heard at United NationsPolitical dirt diggers target Pete Buttigieg as Indiana mayor\u0026#39s rise catches rival campaigns unawaresSpain heads to polls with political future on knife edgeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meet 85 year old runner taking 39th london marathon","story":"Ken Jones has run the London Marathon every year since its inception.

Freddie has become much more conscious about his hand recently so this is incredible, he really wanted to be able to eat a burger just like all of his friends.As soon as he put on the arm he realised what to do, it was immediate. It will change his life.The arm is the first medically approved prosthesis in Britain which allows for precise and delicate movements that other prosthetic hands cannot doFreddie has been described as a \u0027tech pioneer\u0027 by Open Bionics - the company who create the \u0027hero arms\u0027 - as the world\u0027s youngest user of a multi-grip bionic arm.When Freddie was born Suzy was told by private doctors it would be \u0027over 20 years\u0027 before technology became available which could replicate the movements of fingers.However, Freddie\u0027s dream was fitted with the bionic limb on March 28 - two days before his eighth birthday.The budding youngster had tried a prosthetic hand in the past but Suzy described it as \u0027doll-like\u0027 with no movement.Finally Suzy spotted Tilly Lockey - a 12-year-old girl who is the ambassador for Open Bionics and recipient of two \u0027hero\u0027 arms - on Good Morning Britain and realised this prosthetic was exactly what her son needed.She said: We had already begun the process of looking into private options but I remember spotting Tilly on television.She could do so much with her hands. I never thought at that stage anything could be done because of his age.When I found out Open Bionics decided to take him on as the youngest in the world I could not believe it.Freddie, who lives with Suzy, his sister Megan, 12, and Suzy\u0027s fiancee Nathan Darlick, 43, was fitted with the £10k arm - self-funded by his family - at the end of March 2019.Speaking about his new arm, the brave boy said: I was so excited to use my new arm.It has let me do loads of new things with my friends and play like anyone else.I used to have to use an old prosthetic arm which linked me to my scooter handlebars but now I can grip it like anyone else.Freddie Cook was given his \u0026#39hero arm\u0026#39 days before his eighth birthday I love that I can high five everyone and shake my mum\u0027s hand.Suzy said Freddie had started to become \u0027conscious\u0027 of not having a right hand as he grew older.She added: As he grew up it wasn\u0027t too much of an issue and he got by.In recent years as he has got older, Freddie started to notice it more and he became a bit more conscious he didn\u0027t have a right hand like everybody else.Suzy couldn\u0027t believe how quickly Freddie began to use the arm.She said: We were all chatting away in the room when he first put it on.Within about a minute, Freddie had worked out how to make the \u0027blah blah blah\u0027 sign with his fingers which we all thought was so funny.Freddie shook my hand almost straight away, it worked immediately. It was such an incredible moment.He came up to me recently and said \u0027Mum, I can be like everybody else now\u0027. It is his new normality.Freddie, from Bracknell, Berks., celebrated his birthday at a trampoline park before going to the cinema and to eat his favourite burger.He has spent the past three weeks learning how to make new movements with his hand.Suzy, a beautician, said: At first his school were a little sceptical because he had apparently told his friends the arm would have lasers on, which is funny.However, when they realised what it was all about, they have been brilliant.We\u0027re overwhelmed with how well everything has turned out.Samantha Payne, co-founder and COO at Open Bionics said: We\u0027re incredibly excited to fit eight year old Freddie with our smallest ever bionic arm.With the Hero Arm, we wanted to create a bionic technology that was very advanced but also available, democratically, to the masses.As the world\u0027s youngest user of a multi-grip bionic arm, Freddie is a tech pioneer. Slimming pill offers hope for millions in battle against obesityRape victims told to hand over mobile phones or see attackers walk freeFailing prisons are a hotbed of extremism, Government adviser warnsWorkplace stress drives up disability discrimination claims by more than a third, employment law experts saySpain election: Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wins as far-Right makes breakthroughMystery behind \u2028£50k high fashion at charity shopLine of Duty, episode 4, review: Anna Maxwell Martin steals show in battle of HastingsHuawei is legally-obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence services, Jeremy Hunt warns1p and 2p U-turn as Philip Hammond to announce they will no longer be scrappedBritain should eat less red meat, plant millions of trees and build wind turbines, Government advisors to sayTories braced for worst local election losses since 1995 as party chiefs admit they face fury over BrexitJeremy Corbyn faces open revolt over second referendum as Tom Watson appeals directly to Labour activists Comment: Don\u0026#39t take out your Brexit frustrations on our hard-working Tory councillorsSnake\u0026#39s on a bus: Passengers alarmed after serpent boards service in ScotlandConcern councils using drones to snoop on planning extensions as dozens apply for aviation licencesMotorway signs should be redrawn to curb careless driving, transport watchdog warnsPig slaughtering at award winning primary school sparks fury of animal activistsStowe school asks premiership football scouts to help them find under privileged pupilsBack to work in the morning: London runner Hayley Carruthers stumbles into nation\u0026#39s hearts as one of the marathon eliteArmy veteran jailed in Dubai over disputed drugs charges to have his plight heard at United NationsPolitical dirt diggers target Pete Buttigieg as Indiana mayor\u0026#39s rise catches rival campaigns unawaresWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/28/TELEMMGLPICT000195448315_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJoJJwbSFFB6FIbXJ7mwEDJxWLfs5mAvkbXYQqrLnBas.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mystery behind 50k high fashion charity shop","story":"Customer Margaret Mercer browses through the collection at the Mind shop in Tunbridge WellsYour local charity shop might not be where you’d usually pick up a Mulberry dress, a Gucci coat or a skirt favoured by the likes of the Duchess of Sussex.But thanks to an anonymous donation to a Mind store in Kent – there is £50,000 worth of designer clothes up for grabs at huge cut prices.A regular donor dropped clothes and accessories from high fashion brands such as Prada and Rupert Sanderson to the charity shop in Tunbridge Wells.The donation included a Prada skirt, a Chloé handbag, a Gucci wool coat, Rupert Sanderson shoes and a Mulberry dress. The dress would be worth £900 if bought new, however, it has been on sale for £425.The generous bundle also features a luxury silk skirt worth an eye-watering £1,180 by Canadian brand Erdem, favoured by the Duchess of Sussex.Alison Homewood, the store manager, said the items, some of which are brand new, are in high demand but several items are still available.Alison Homewood with a £900 Mulberry dress - on sale at Mind for £425Ms Homewood, who has worked at Mind for 14 years, said: “We’re delighted to be able to offer designer products, such as Prada shoes, Chloé handbags and Valentino dresses for a competitive price.“Our shop relies on the generosity of the community so while we’re delighted to receive these designer items we also value other previously loved items.This Kate Spade dress, usually £230, could be yours for £140“It’s amazing. We are really, really busy, but we are not complaining. We had a beautiful Valentino dress we sold for £650 in plain black with a gorgeous ice cream pleat in pale blue, yellow and pink.“I don’t know how much a Prada skirt costs and so I have to go on the Prada website and look, which is why the collection didn’t come out until Wednesday.“The items came in at the end of last week – it is a regular donor and she donates stuff to us on quite a regular basis.”Off the peg: the collection is worth £50,000Bought brand new a Valentino dress would cost almost £2,000.Prada, Gucci, Mulberry and Kate Spade items have already been sold.A houndstooth check Burberry-style coat by Gucci was sold for £400. Similar coats have been sold for more than £2,000.The total value of the items would have originally been £50,000 but the shop hopes to make £15,000 for the mental health charity.These shoes by Rupert Sanderson shoes sold for £140, a saving of more than £300 on the recommended retail priceWhile Ms Homewood is thankful for the high-value donations, she does not want them to detract from the kindness of other donors who contribute to the shop’s everyday success.She said: “It is exciting to see these glamorous, high-fashion items. But it is always exciting to look in any bag because you never know what you will find and more importantly, it is more money for the charity.“We treat every donor the same. It doesn’t matter if they are dropping off one item or 100 items, we are always grateful.“It’s fantastic to get all this stuff but it does not detract from the normal donations – the things that we sell for £5 or £6.“Yes, it’s great to have this amazing quality clothing, but it’s amazing that people bring things in every day otherwise we would not have been here for 20 years.”Workplace stress drives up disability discrimination claims by more than a third, employment law experts saySpain election: Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez wins as far-Right makes breakthroughLine of Duty, episode 4, review: Anna Maxwell Martin steals show in battle of HastingsHuawei is legally-obliged to co-operate with Chinese intelligence services, Jeremy Hunt warns1p and 2p U-turn as Philip Hammond to announce they will no longer be scrappedBritish boy aged 8 becomes world\u0026#39s youngest to be fitted with bionic arm as he celebrated eating with both hands for first timeComment: Don\u0026#39t take out your Brexit frustrations on our hard-working Tory councillorsBritain should eat less red meat, plant millions of trees and build wind turbines, Government advisors to sayTories braced for worst local election losses since 1995 as party chiefs admit they face fury over BrexitJeremy Corbyn faces open revolt over second referendum as Tom Watson appeals directly to Labour activists Snake\u0026#39s on a bus: Passengers alarmed after serpent boards service in ScotlandConcern councils using drones to snoop on planning extensions as dozens apply for aviation licencesMotorway signs should be redrawn to curb careless driving, transport watchdog warnsPig slaughtering at award winning primary school sparks fury of animal activistsStowe school asks premiership football scouts to help them find under privileged pupilsBack to work in the morning: London runner Hayley Carruthers stumbles into nation\u0026#39s hearts as one of the marathon eliteArmy veteran jailed in Dubai over disputed drugs charges to have his plight heard at United NationsPolitical dirt diggers target Pete Buttigieg as Indiana mayor\u0026#39s rise catches rival campaigns unawaresSpain heads to polls with political future on knife edgeOrdnance Survey to adjust Victorian-era formula for calculating walks as modern ramblers fail to keep paceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 28 april 2019","story":"Investigators searching for bodies with a special camera in a man-made lake near the village of Mitsero outside of the capital Nicosia, Cyprus.

Which has not stopped him founding Gospel Technology, mastering the mysteries of blockchain, and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the word “DEUS”. Now 40, the tech CEO was born in Cumbria, and retains the accent of the northwest, redolent of hills and dales. \u0026nbsp“All of my bloodline have been craftsmen,” he says – carpenters, metal workers, shaping “tangible” things. His father worked on oilrigs and at Sellafield. “I’m an engineer too,” he adds.\u0026nbsp“But I’ve gone more intangible. The trick is finding the tangibility in software.”After studying geology at Sheffield University, Smith got a job working for the British Antarctic Survey on the Y2K issue. It was 1999 and everyone was panicking about a potential technology meltdown. “I found I quite liked tech,” he says. From there he went to HSBC to set up their internet banking platform. “No one had a mobile phone back then – we actually had to make physical connections.” He shakes his head with a kind of amazement.A View from the Top with Mumsnet founder Justine RobertsBy 2010, the free flow of data was becoming more important than the infrastructure. It didn’t matter so much what the machine was any more. This was the thinking behind Smith’s first company, Butterfly, which provided “middle-ware” to enable businesses to adapt their hardware to accommodate and exploit data.It was a success, but Smith was fundamentally frustrated. It wasn’t “tangible” enough for him, it lacked something his forebears took for granted: the feeling of truth, of tangibility, the smack of the empirical. So after selling Butterfly to IBM in 2012, he “retired” and found greater “day-to-day fulfilment” buying and fixing up old Massey Ferguson tractors and planting a vineyard outside Henley. Ever the troubleshooter, Smith even came up with a fix for getting the grapes to ripen faster on the vine: “We’ve exposed the ground so it radiates the heat back at the vine – it gives you an extra 15 minutes of warmth at the end of the day.” \u0026nbspIt’s all very tangible, and even drinkable (the 2018 vintage looks set to be “some of the best”), but, as Smith discovered, “sometimes not working is more work than working”. His epiphany occurred when he read a paper by Satoshi Nakamoto. It is very likely that Satoshi Nakamoto does not exist and is the spurious cover for an inidual or iniduals unknown. But, even so, Nakamoto is credited with the invention of bitcoin. Smith was not particularly inspired by crypto-currency, but rather by “a beautifully elegant architecture”. He realised that at the core of the new concept of blockchain was the possibility of “trusted transactions”. In other words, of truth, even on the internet, which is fast becoming a byword for fraud and deception. He reckons a lot of social media is crippled by the same problem: “Consumption has moved ahead of governance.” A lot of users, but operating in a lawless, post-truth environment of information anarchy. He cites Facebook as a classic case study. “They recklessly moved forward without trust. I believe\u0026nbspin collaboration, but what if your collaborators turn out to be ill-intentioned Russians?”Created with Sketch.Technology comes to Bhutan Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A youth drinks whiskey at a bar in the capital city of Thimphu, BhutanDrayang dancer Lhaden, 38, performs in a bar in the capital city of Thimphu, Bhutan, December 16, 2017.

And truth and trust are interdependent. Truth generates trust without trust there is no truth. The question, as Smith saw it, while toiling honestly over his tractors and grapes, was how to achieve “trusted collaboration”. You can build a fortress, but then how do you move data out of the fortress and make it accessible to others, without also opening the door to thieves and bad guys? Smith says that trust can only be “data-driven” not “intuition-driven”. In other words, it’s hard to trust your fellow man or woman. “Problems arise where humans are interacting. If you’re involved in a digital process, then the human is usually a liability.”He laughs at the idea that this sounds rather like Skynet (of Terminator fame) i.e. all we need to do is completely eliminate humanity and all will be well. “What we’re doing is ensuring a trusted foundation to data, across businesses, governments and countries.” This is where blockchain comes in. It makes data accessible to a variety of users but protects against cyber attack. What everybody now fears, when you watch those pixels dance across your screen, is that you might be looking at “data” (so-called) that’s been hacked or corrupted. A form of “fake news”. Gospel is there to ensure the purity of your data. Smith makes a strong claim: “We have eliminated lying. It’s impossible to lie any more.”So does that mean novelists and Hollywood screenwriters are out of a job then? Smith allows that there is still scope for fiction in the world at large, but not in the realm of Gospel. “We’re talking about decentralised, distributed truth. But it’s a tighter network of participants.”Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children\u0027s minister A View from the Top with Dragons\u0027 Den star Tej LalvaniA View from the Top: David Frank, the TV exec who upset the QueenA View From the Top: Peter Simpson of Anglian WaterThere is a philosophical air to Smith, as if he is seeing everything from a great height. He argues that what he calls “the old hub-and-spoke model” or “legacy architecture” doesn’t work any more. We used to have faith in a central core with players on the periphery. But Smith reckons we are all now sceptical about the centralisation of data. The failed efforts of the NHS to digitise provide a cautionary example. “Most of those projects are obsolete by the time they get to market. Machines used to have a five-year life. Now it’s more like six\u0026nbspmonths. Data has to be fluid.”The blockchain approach taken by Gospel has produced “a system in which multiple parties agrees that this is the truth”. The chain is a form of “distributed trust”. You need trust. But how do you trust? The answer is, every time you write to the chain, you create a signature\u0026nbspand you write that into the next block, creating “aggregated signatures”. This builds\u0026nbspwhat Smith calls “immutability”, making the exchange of data invulnerable to modification – and hacking.Since it was founded at the beginning of 2017, Gospel has specialised in working with the aerospace industry and pharmaceutical companies. But “removing risk and reducing cost” could be applied to just about any\u0026nbspbusiness\u0026nbsp– so everyone could do with a bit of immutability.\u0026nbspIn his leisure hours, Smith also likes to get his hands dirty and repair and ride old motorbikes. He has one dating back to the 1920s, a BSA, still rideable, but\u0026nbsp“only short distances”. This explains the\u0026nbspT-shirt. DEUS is short for “deus ex machina”, the clever brand name of a motorcycle company from Australia. Smith gives it his own spin: “Truth from the machine, that’s how I see it.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to consider a change in approachClick to followThe IndependentHMRC has been given extra resources to tackle non payment of the minimum wage The problem with the welcome war between Labour and the Conservatives over minimum wage rates is that it means nothing if employers ignore them.\u0026nbspAccording to the Low Pay Commission, a record number of people were underpaid last year by those that chose to do just that.\u0026nbspIn a report published just a few weeks after the minimum wage celebrated its 20 year anniversary, it put the number at 439,000\u0026nbspand rising.\u0026nbsp\u0027Worrying\u0027 rise in number of people being paid below minimum wageMinimum wage at 20: Too many employers still trying to get around itTwenty years on, the national minimum wage is a successYounger workers were particularly vulnerable, even though employers are allowed to pay them less. Ditto women. The report tagged childcare as the occupation with the highest proportion of underpaid workers, with hospitality and retail, which similarly employ an unusually high proportion of female workers, also high on the list.\u0026nbspBut hang on a second, I hear you say. Wasn’t HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs (HMRC) given a bunch of extra cash by the Department for Business, Energy \u0026amp Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to bring enforcement actions?\u0026nbspThat is indeed the case, as BEIS was keen to stress in response to the report. And there is evidence that it is having results. HMRC identified an all-time high number of workers as underpaid in the 2017-18 financial year, securing pay rises and arrears for them while also levying fines.\u0026nbspYet the number of cases overall stood still. The figures were driven by a relatively small number of big cases.\u0026nbspWhat this tells you is that HMRC is deploying its resources where it can get the most bang for its buck.\u0026nbspAn eminently sensible policy given that its budget is not unlimited, even after the increases it has enjoyed and the complexities and expense involved in investigating underpayment – and bringing miscreant employers to book.The trouble is that this is inevitably going to lead to a long tail of often smaller employers that are cheating the system and may justifiably feel there is little risk to them in doing so.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Sometimes it can be as simple as delaying the introduction of new rates. Sometimes it’s a lot worse than that.\u0026nbspHelpfully the commission, which also advises on the rates themselves, has some sensible ideas for addressing the issue, which can be summarised as calling for a more holistic approach.\u0026nbspAs part of this, it wants to see more investment in communicating with workers, and employers, together with efforts to build confidence in complaints processes, and to help workers to use them.\u0026nbspIt would also like government to work more closely with unions, which obviously have considerable expertise in this area through the work they do for low paid members and could provide a great deal of assistance.\u0026nbspCheating the minimum wage not only cheats workers.

But it’s only recently that everyone has been able to see what the store has in stock\u0026nbspfor them.Kibworth\u0026nbspBooks is among hundreds of independent UK booksellers who have started using NearSt technology, which allows small retailers to compete with Amazon by making their inventory visible in online searches. As well as listing stock online for potential customers to browse, NearSt has an add-on feature that makes the store appear in searches when people in the area Google the specific title they want.Retailers say high street footfall up March but shoppers didn’t spend Debenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Government must protect British retailers from giants like Amazon“Now we have 8,000 titles findable by people who are walking past the shop, or in the pub three minutes down the road,” says Debbie James, who started Kibworth Books when she left the music industry 10 years ago. “They can Google a book from the pub and our shop will come up before Amazon, Waterstones and WHSmith.”NearSt was founded by Max Kreijn and Nick Brackenbury in 2015 with one mission: to get more people into high street shops. The startup comes at a time of rapid change for UK high streets. More than 30 major retailers have shut since Woolworths closed in 2008, according to the ONS. Job losses from the retail sector are expected to rise nearly 20 per cent in 2019, putting 164,000 people out of work and leading to the closure of a further 22,000 stores, according to the Centre for Retail Research.It’s an interesting time in retail,” Brackenbury says. “I think the high street has a ton of value but it needs to be unlocked.”Brackenbury and Kreijn met 10 years ago when they were working together at Ogilvy, the advertising agency. Brackenbury was a graduate trainee and Kreijn was a strategist in a small team of three or four people doing early social analytics.\u0026nbspNot long after, Kreijn left the firm to start his own company, an innovation consultancy helping big companies behave more like startups. He was spending a lot of time working out how big companies could take old assets and come up with something new, when he had a “literal lightbulb moment” – a lightbulb in his living room blew, and when he Googled for a replacement, the search threw up online shops, rather than stores near him.The next time Kreijn saw Brackenbury, he pitched him the lightbulb problem: how could they unlock the retail industry’s massive stock inventory, and make it available in the place where most people were starting to shop – online?\u0026nbsp“I told him I was sure someone had figured out his problem already,” Brackenbury says. “But when I looked at it I thought, ‘My god, why hasn’t anyone done this?’ And it turns out no one has done this because it is quite hard.”The technology developed by NearSt echoes work by Alibaba, the biggest e-commerce company in China, which has been converting 100,000 retail stores into Alibaba-linked smart stores. Customers in these smart stores are able to source products missing in some stores from others nearby, so they know where to look next – or where to order the product for home delivery.NearSt has had early success with booksellers as many of them use the same book supplier, Gardners Books, which makes it easy for NearSt to digitise the inventory used by multiple independent stores. But it is much more of a challenge to digitise and extract the data from hundreds of thousands of small shops.\u0026nbsp“The inventory is locked away in these archaic inventory systems that weren’t built for the modern world,” Brackenbury says. “So if you search for a product on your phone, it shows you hundreds of products in warehouses up the M1 corridor, even though you could be stood outside a shop that sells that very same product and you just don’t know about it. That seems bonkers.”NearSt has developed software to extract and understand rudimentary stock data and feed it into the internet, so that Google doesn’t just show online results, but also local availability.\u0026nbspIf an online inventory is the best way for retailers to take back the bite of their profit stolen by Amazon, why haven’t more done it? “The data challenge is hard for a retailer to do,” Brackenbury says. Many companies that do have digital inventories are using mainframe technology that was built in 1988. Even after the store has established a barcode, a stock level and a price, they must also have pictures, product descriptions and titles before it can be listed as a product online.\u0026nbsp“It’s a huge ask, and they’re busy so they don’t do it,” Brackenbury says. “We connect into old systems, extract information, understand what it is and enrich it so the retailer doesn’t have to do anything. They keep managing the inventory in the same way, but we make it visible on the web.”Last year, NearSt was approached by a Google employee who explained that the search company wanted to list local inventory. “It’s an incredible way for us to make a huge impact,” Brackenbury says of the partnership. “We looked at who we wanted to feed data into, and then Google came to us and said they could feed it into the world’s biggest search engine – that’s the way to achieve that mission.”The company has raised £1.5m to date and is in the middle of another funding round. Brackenbury knows that as the company’s mission grows, it must do what it can to safeguard the privacy of stores. He imagines opening inventory data to other technology companies, like Facebook and Uber, so that users can get instant delivery of branded spirits from local stores by nearby couriers, for instance. But he says this would have to be done with the consent of the retailers, so their inventory only appears when they want it to.At Kibworth Books, James say the decision to sign up to NearSt was a “no brainer”. She recently paid an extra £2 a day for the store to appear in local Google searches for titles around World Book Day. “I did it for two weeks to get my shop out there when families who weren’t aware of us were searching where to get the books from,” she says. “Looking at the statistics it was worth it, you can safely say footfall increased.”Independent bookshops on the rise for the second year runningBrackenbury meanwhile says that in a few years, live inventory technology will be so commonplace we will wonder how we ever did without it: “Within three or four years, this real time local inventory will seem completely normal to us in the same way that now\u0026nbspif you look up on your phone what time Boots shuts, Google tells you the closing time for the nearest store. Four years ago that didn’t exist,” he says. Whether it can save the high street remains to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The new owners include Barclays and Bank of Ireland, as well as US investment firms.It first put forward proposals in October to shut 50 stores over three years as it bids to cut costs.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Welcome steps have been taken in that direction, but this work shows more needs to be done.”A government spokesperson said: “It is illegal not to pay the minimum wage and we are cracking down on employers who fail to pay the national minimum wage and national living wage.“We have almost doubled HMRC’s budget to £26.3m since 2015, ensuring it has the resources needed to investigate employers who break these rules.“HMRC has collected £15.6m of underpayment for over 200,000 workers and issued £14.1m\u0026nbspin financial penalties to employers that breached the rules – the highest amount ever.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But this isn’t a typical beauty pageant.The women are from former Soviet Union countries, and on Saturday, are competing for the title “Miss USSR UK”.Some have travelled to London from abroad for the contest, others are based in Britain.The USSR Empire may have collapsed 28 years ago – but in London, the idea feels\u0026nbsp alive and carefully preserved.“Miss USSR” was held in Moscow for three years before the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Its successor, “Miss USSR UK” has run in London for seven years.The contest is now growing\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspin 2018, the same competition took place in Monaco, and according to the organisers, is set to be an annual event. There are also plans now to stage “Miss USSR” in Montenegro.But this year’s main contest is taking place on 27 April in London’s luxurious Hilton Hotel in Mayfair.It unites women from across the former Soviet countries – including those the USSR occupied in 1940.Created with Sketch.The world today, according to the Soviet Union in 1960 Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Driving force: prototype autonomous cars in a sunny Soviet 2017Face time: live video communication, as imagined in 1960Lines man: the International  across the north of EurasiaWater way: connecting the Arctic Ocean with the Caspian SeaPolar express: high-speed atomic-powered trains across the Bering StraitDriving force: prototype autonomous cars in a sunny Soviet 2017Face time: live video communication, as imagined in 1960Lines man: the International  across the north of EurasiaWater way: connecting the Arctic Ocean with the Caspian SeaPolar express: high-speed atomic-powered trains across the Bering StraitIndeed the vast majority of this year’s applicants appear to come from Ukraine, despite the ongoing conflict with Russia.“We will show how beauty will save the world,” claims the Miss USSR UK website.But the competition has faced stiff criticism from various sides.“It shows a serious lack of taste and historical awareness,” former British ambassador to Latvia Ian Bond told The Independent, now foreign policy director at the Centre for European Reform.“Imagine if someone organised a \u0027Miss Third Reich\u0027 competition for women from countries occupied by the Nazis? Or even \u0027Miss British Empire\u0027?!” he adds.\u0026nbspThe organisers, however, deny that there is any ideological motivation behind the contest.\u0026nbsp“Our name has nothing to do with politics,” Kateryna Burceva, who co-organised the contest in 2012, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. Burceva is no longer involved in Miss USSR.Karina Barulina, a 2014 finalist from Moscow, agrees.It’s only named after the Soviet Empire, she says, to make it more inclusive.“It had been called this way deliberately to avoid discrimination, because it’s not only Russian girls participating, but Russian-speaking girls also. This name makes it more understandable.”Applicants shoot and present videos about themselves and their countries, whilst wearing in national costumes on stage.On the contest’s website, an applicant from Crimea is listed among the girls representing Russia.Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014, in\u0026nbsp a move considered illegal by the UN General Assembly. The vast majority of the international communities does not recognise Crimea as a part of Russia.Hunt enrages Slovenia by wrongly saying it was \u0027Soviet vassal state\u0027And while the organisers insist that the contest is non-political, they also invite diplomats to the show every year.However, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Uzbekistani diplomats said that they were first told about the contest by The Independent and insisted they have never attended.Titova was reluctant to name them, adding: “Kazakhstani diplomats attend with a great pleasure. I just do not know to what extent it is politically correct to mention them.”Moldovan diplomats came to the event back in 2016 according to the “Miss USSR UK” Instagram page.Representatives from the Kazakhstan and Moldovan embassies in the UK did not immediately respond to The Independent’s request for comment.Several former Soviet countries have spoken out against the competition.“The invitation of Lithuanian girls to participate in the event, named on behalf of the Soviet Union, shows great disrespect for the restored independence of Lithuania,” says a statement on the Lithuanian Embassy’s website.Imagine if someone organised a \u0027Miss Third Reich\u0027 competition for women from countries occupied by the Nazis? Or even \u0027Miss British EmpireLithuanian diplomats in the UK tell The Independent that they have asked the contest’s organisers to remove any reference to Lithuania from its literature, but that the organisers did not oblige.\u0026nbspA spokesperson from the Latvian Embassy told to The Independent that they advise women not to take part in the event, stressing that those who do, “by no means represent Latvia.”Aliyor Tilavov, political counsel at the Uzbekistan embassy, was similarly unimpressed.“We do not approve this contest and we have no connection to it. If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do not,” he says.The contest also gathers “representatives of royal families, lords, directors and CEOs of global corporations,” according to its website.Titova, the director, declined to provide further information on this year’s guests.“They are quite influential and noble people. We care about our clients and do not disclose this information.”For John Lough, Russia expert at Chatham House and a former NATO representative in Moscow, the event seeks to reinforce a longing for the Soviet Union, and hope to use such VIP guests to do so.“It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history. We are all together’.”“That is clearly not consistent with reality,” Lough adds.Women compete to win a contract with an international modelling agency, which changes annually.This year, it remains a secret.Titova says that the first runners-ups will also get a trip to the hotel Rixos in Kemer on Turkey’s coast and a holiday exploring Montenegro on a 42-metre luxury yacht called Riana.“Miss USSR UK” was first launched in 2012 by Titova.If someone has nostalgia for a Soviet Union, we do notShe had moved to London a couple of years earlier to work as a nightclub promoter, but says she soon decided to promote her own beauty pageant.To take part in the contest, there is an online vote for the best-looking women. Votes have to be purchased, at a cost of 1 euro for three votes.The winner is likely determined by how much money backers are ready to spend, as the number of votes a person can buy is unlimited.But money itself is not a guarantee of getting a place in the show in the first place, says Julia Rebenok, a 2018 finalist from Ukraine.Women who win this first stage then have to pass a Skype interview.“The organisers look at your body shape and ask you to do a small catwalk on the camera,” Rebenok says.Selected candidates then pay a £300 participation fee and the preparation for the show begins in earnest.Inspirational and transformational coaches are employed to train the girls prior to the competition.The webinars are available for anyone to join. During one, Ekaterina Lebedeva, a psychologist and sexologist, teaches the applicants how to produce pheromones while performing on the stage.It possibly seeks to reinforce an agenda that the Russian state would be very comfortable with, that ‘we are all one big happy family, whatever happened in history“Listen, girls, you should remind yourself where our vaginal tube is. Now we begin to compress it, we compress our vaginal muscles. One, two, three…”“At the beauty contest, there will be men among the judges. You do not even need perfume. You will emit a smell of sexuality and it is not vulgar. Male judges will not understand why they like you, but they will like you,” Lebedeva continues.Lebedeva participated in the “Miss USSR” contest in Monaco last year, where she met her future husband, a Russian drummer. She was introduced to him by a contest’s choreographer, she says during her webinar.“I participated in the contest to get married,” she confesses.“Perhaps someone will see you at the beauty contest as there are some decent men. Behave properly.”The tickets to the show, starting at £400, are not available to the general public. The event is private - for “VIP clients” only.“A person files an application on the website and our team decides whether to approve it or decline,” says Titova.\u0026nbspTop TV and pop-stars perform at the events.Sonique, Sheyla Bonnick from Boney M and DJ Smash are among those who have provided entertainment in recent years.Despite the extravagance of the contest, “Miss USSR Management Ltd”, the company, owned by Titova, does not earn much, according to its balance sheets filed on Companies House.In 2016 the company first declared profit - £877 of current assets. In 2017 it showed a negative balance of £6,308.How Tintin satirised the Soviet UnionThe contest, though, has a strong financial backing from sponsors.“As long as sponsors pay, the contest exists,” says ex-organiser Burceva.Among the sponsors are London Luxury Chauffeuring, Caviar House, and The Elite London – \u0026nbspan exclusive jet-set lifestyle event for rich people.However, by far the biggest company backing Miss USSR UK is Rixos, the luxury chain of 25 hotels around the world.Rixos was founded by Turkish businessmen Fettah Tamince, but, according to emails leaked through Football Leaks and published by The Black Sea news agency in 2016, 50 per cent of the Rixos shares are owned by a Kazakh businessman Tevfik Arif. He has extensive links to Russia and used to work in Moscow for 17 years in the Soviet Ministry of Trade.He is also the founder of the Bayrock Group, which has worked with the Trump Organization on multiple projects.Arif was previously reported to be involved in a sex scandal - he had been arrested together with nine prostitutes from Russia during a party on the yacht in Turkey in 2010 and charged with financing an international prostitution ring, but in 2011 was acquitted.As long as sponsors pay, the contest existsEighty kilometres away lies the Rixos Sungate, where the finalists of “Miss USSR UK” spent a holiday in spring 2018. The next visit is planned for this summer.Sponsors put money into “Miss USSR UK” to advertise their businesses, Titova says.However, not many sponsors place the competition’s logo on their own websites.“We make a marketing strategy for a year and offer opportunities for companies to attract new clients,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Plus a photo shoot with our contestants.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The scenario has been developed by one of the Nasa organisations tasked with studying such near-earth objects, or NEOs.It will bring together not just Nasa\u0026nbspbut other international organisations to test out their response. Such exercises are used across the disaster response sector, to ensure that the real responses are as fast and effective as possible.These exercises have really helped us in the planetary\u0026nbspdefense\u0026nbspcommunity to understand what our colleagues on the disaster management side need to know, said Lindley Johnson, NASA\u0027s Planetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspOfficer.

Groups such as Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspPlanetary\u0026nbspDefense\u0026nbspCoordination Office (PDCO) as well as the European Space Agency\u0027s Space Situational Awareness-NEO Segment and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) have been working to better communicate the danger that such objects pose to Earth.Universe expanding faster than expected, Nasa data confirmsAs part of that mission, officials will play out such a scenario in an attempt to demonstrate how Earth might respond.There is no strict script in such an exercise. Instead, it will be used to test out how\u0026nbspNEO observers, space agency officials, emergency managers, decision makers and citizens would respond to the threat of an impact, and how that might become clear.It will start with the story that on 26 March, astronomers have found an NEO that could be hazardous to Earth. They will be told that it has been tracked for a\u0026nbsp few months and that it has a one in 100 chance of hitting Earth in 2027 – the chances that would require action from people on Earth.Those taking part will discuss possible preparations: how they would explore the asteroid, work out the best ways of deflecting it and dealing with its impact effects.Nasa has already participated in such exercises, working on some with\u0026nbspthe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Those exercises brough representatives from a variety of different federal agencies, including the departments of Defense and State.Previous exercises showed that the focus of emergency management officials was not on scientific details. Instead, they just want to know when, where and how an asteroid will hit the Earth, as well as what sort of damage is done, according to FEMA.Nasa continues to work on that science, however, in an attempt to better improve humanity\u0027s ability to predict the exact location and effects of any impact.NASA and FEMA will continue to conduct periodic exercises with a continually widening community of US\u0026nbspgovernment agencies and international partners, said Leviticus Lewis of the Response Operations Division for\u0026nbspFEMA. They are a great way for us to learn how to work together and meet each other\u0027s needs and the objectives laid out in the White House National NEO Preparedness Action Plan.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She later sued the company for defamation and violating her privacy rightsThe company were ordered to pay up to $45 million dollars back to New York based drivers, after taking too much in commission over a two and a half year period. “We made a mistake and we are committed to making it right by paying every driver every penny they are owed, plus interest, as quickly as possible,” said Rachel Holt, Uber’s regional general manager in the US and Canada, to the Wall Street JournalUber\u0027s self-driving cars were ordered to be removed from the roads by a Californian car regulator, after being spotted skipping traffic lights.

Straddling the rugged shore is a single row of ruined cottages once nicknamed Starvation Point and left empty since the 19th century. Up above, land previously grazed by Highland cattle is now brown and covered with bracken. Abandonment rules here.“We’ve plenty of work to do,” says John, 67, all beard and boots. “But what a canvas to do it on. We’re offering people the chance to help rebuild paradise.”Ulva – a rugged seven-by-three-mile crown a couple of minutes over the water from its bigger Inner Hebrides neighbour\u0026nbspMull – has, for two centuries, been an island in decline.In 1851, it boasted a\u0026nbsppopulation of some 859 inhabitants: a thriving community of builders, farmers, merchants and tailors.\u0026nbspToday, it has dwindled to a single family of four and their solitary neighbour. A listed church, Victorian reservoir and sprawling mansion complete with library and south-facing balcony have all been left derelict.In a pattern repeated across dozens of Scotland’s 93 inhabited islands, waves of young people have ebbed away to the mainland as investment and jobs on these remote outposts became harder and\u0026nbspharder to come by.But here in Ulva, once a favoured holiday destination of both Beatrix Potter and William Wordsworth, there are plans afoot to reverse this particular tide of history.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 52Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Cyclists lay down as they take part in the Extinction Rebellion protest at the Tate Modern in London, BritainLiberal Democratic Party leader Vince Cable speaks at a launch event for the party\u0027s candidates for the European Parliament election in LondonExtinction Rebellion protesters (left to right) Alan Heath, 55, research scientist, Jen Witts, 38, support worker for vulnerable people, Sian Vaughan 53, retired head teacher, Debbie Rees, 57, Gardener and artist, Kef Shimidzu, 55, tutor and learning support worker, Lucy Galvin, 53, civil servant and Johnny Woon, 60, retired, glued themselves to the entrances of the London Stock Exchange in the City of LondonEngineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

The target is to have at least 30 people living here within a decade, and 50 by 2040. That derelict church – a secluded white-walled Thomas Telford design – has already been earmarked as a possible part-time music venue.“Imagine seeing a show there,” enthuses John, a director with the North West Mull Community Woodland Company (NWMCWC), which bought the land. “Walking home afterwards, by the sea and the stars – magical.”Addy on Ulva (Colin Drury)Crucially, these plans have significance far beyond this slug of rock alone. If the transformation is successful, it is hoped it could become a template for other Scottish islands facing similar decline, and an inspiration to communities across the planet struggling with depopulation.The good news, then, is the signs, so far, are positive. A survey conducted by the Highlands Small Communities Housing Trust in January saw almost 500 people register official interest in becoming residents of Ulva. Many of them had exactly the skills needed to rebuild a community from scratch: forestry experts, land labourers, one woman who proposed opening a pony-trekking business for visitors.Highland cows make breathtaking journey to uninhabited island“For pretty much all recorded time – and before that too – there has been a vibrant, close-knit community here,” says John, a retired marine biologist originally from Yorkshire but now living on Mull. “And people still want to live here. If we can offer sustainable economic opportunities, we have no doubt they’ll come.”Sitting outside the glorious Boathouse restaurant on the island’s eastern shore later, it is easy to understand his confidence.Some 5,000 daytrippers come here every summer from as far and wide as Australia and Canada (where many Ulvians moved in the mid-1800s when much of the land was forcibly cleared for agricultural use). They are drawn by the ruins, pristine sea views and abundant wildlife: deer, seals, hen harriers and more than 500 types of plant are native to the islet.At the next table along at the restaurant today are a family of English visitors. “It’s basically an idyll, isn’t it?” says Dad, tucking into the fish of the day. Would he move here, I ask?\u0026nbspHe pauses, possibly considering the fact there are no shops, no real roads and only one tin-can ferry that stops running at 5pm. “You’d need to be pretty self-sufficient,” he concedes. “I might be a bit soft.”UlvaSuch concerns did not, apparently, put off the Russian oligarchs and Middle East sheikhs who originally expressed interest when the island’s laird Jamie Hardy – whose family had owned the place since the Fifties – first put it up for sale in 2017.Indeed, it was the thought of such buyers that sparked the initial proposals for a community purchase.The island’s five residents and many in Mull were horrified by the thought that\u0026nbspUlva could be turned into the private playground of an overseas landlord. So, after a local referendum showed support, the NWMCWC – which was originally set up in 2006 to run a local woodland – moved to buy the land.With a £4.4m grant from the Scottish Land Fund and the political support of the SNP government, which has long said it prioritises preserving the country’s islands, the not-for-profit group took ownership on midsummer’s day 2018.It became the third Scottish island to be bought by the community following Eigg in 1997 and Gigha in 2001. Hearteningly, perhaps, both those have since reversed population decline, albeit from far bigger bases than Ulva’s five people (Eigg had 60 living there, Gigha 98).“I’m pretty old-fashioned and not one for crying,” says Rhuri Munro, owner of The Boathouse and board member of the NWMCWC. “But I was close that day we took over.”He had more reason than most to be emotional: Rhuri is a member of the one solitary family who remain residents on Ulva.The 36-year-old first moved here with his own parents when he was eight and the island’s population still stood at about 30. Dad Donald came to run the ferry, a job he still does, although he himself now lives on Mull.Rhuri left at 18 but returned with wife-to-be Rebecca – originally from Dumfries – in 2006. They took over the then vacant Boathouse expanded it to accommodate more of those visitors and took the decision to raise their children, Matilda, eight, and Ross, five, on the island.“It’s not an easy place to live,” he says just before he heads off fishing. “We have broadband and everything but, ultimately, it is an island and it comes with all the logistical issues you’d expect. You can’t get to a shop after 5pm. But I think back to my own childhood and I remember swimming, boating, playing in woods. Being safe. That’s what we want for our two.”Every day, he explains, Donald ferries Matilda and Ross across the water to school.“You can’t get a better commute than that,” 31-year-old Rebecca chips in. “But what we want now is to see that boat full of kids again. Full of friends.”The NWMCWC – a company that comprises eight volunteer directors and four staff – has funded the restructuring of the island’s decaying slipway and signed off plans to renovate six derelict cottages for six new families. If funding grants come in, it says, it could all be done within 18 months. Then, it would look to facilitate the building of six brand new homes, probably with a social housing company.Simultaneously, proposals are being worked up to ide the land into farmable plots and transform the mansion house, possibly into a mini-hotel. Companies are being sought to run wildlife tours, mountain bike trails or sea sports. A record producer in the US has got in touch suggesting he could run artistic retreats there. A full-time Ulva development officer is to be appointed this summer to oversee it all.Rhuri and Rebecca themselves, meanwhile, have carved new signs for the island’s pathways pointing walkers towards the best ruins, wildlife sites and the island’s Neolithic stones. He has been levelling off some of the tracks, while she has dealt with much of the admin that comes with suddenly part-owning an island.“I knew trying to rebuild a community would mean hard labour,” says Rhuri, a little ruefully. “I just didn’t realise how many emails it would mean dealing with.”Much of that admin has to do with money. Regeneration doesn’t come cheap, especially on a land out in the sea. Renovating those first six houses alone could cost £1m.But there is a quiet confidence of getting the grants needed: given that £4.4m of taxpayers’ money has already been sunk into buying the island, there is much political will in Edinburgh to see Ulva become a sustainable success.Nonetheless, that outlay has also caused some to have their doubts about the whole project.Over on Mull later, I visit the island’s biggest town,\u0026nbspTobermory – a comparative metropolis\u0026nbspof 2,000 people that\u0026nbspRhuri calls “the big smoke”.Oldest fossil of life on land found on remote Scottish islandThere I speak to Andrena Duffin, secretary of the Mull Community Council, in her garden overlooking the sea. “I wish the project every success and, as a council, we will offer all the support we can,” she says. “It is important – to Scotland as a whole, actually – these communities prosper.”The 76-year-old, who spent her own childhood summers on Ulva, is hesitant to criticise and chooses her words carefully. “There are some people who feel that kind of money could have been spent on infrastructure that would have benefited more people,” she says, mentioning Mull’s narrow roads, its crumbling main ferry pier and the island’s poor broadband as all in undisputed need of significant investment.“But, in any case, now this is happening, as a community, I think we will pull together and make it work,” she says.Back on Ulva itself, there are plans to celebrate the first year anniversary of the buyout with a music festival in the mansion house gardens – which volunteers have spent the last 12 months weeding out and sprucing up.I meet the island’s only other resident, Barry George, a labourer from Newcastle who moved here 30 years ago to work on a fish farm and was so enamoured he decided to stay even when the work dried up and other islanders left. When I ask the appeal, he looks at me perplexed for a moment.“Look around,” he says after a second. “I never saw a more beautiful place.”Today, he does odd jobs, studies for an Open University degree and opens his little cottage up as an occasional B\u0026ampB for those wanting to stay the night on the island.He lives five minutes from the Munros and the Boathouse but has not got too heavily involved with the buyout. Nonetheless, he too says he dreams of seeing the island become prosperous once more.“I love the tranquillity here,” he says, indicating the sea below, the hills above. “But we do need more people. We need life back again.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The decision on Huawei and this country’s telecommunications network in which, it is claimed, Theresa May was a driving force, is in contrast to the position of many western allies and the “Five Eyes Network”\u0026nbspof English speaking states which share intelligence.\u0026nbspThree of the members of this group – the US, Australia and New Zealand –\u0026nbsphave taken a tougher stance in the involvement of Huawei, effectively prohibiting the installation of the company’s equipment in the next generation of their telecommunications apparatus. Canada is due to announce its position on the issue in the coming months amid strained relations with Beijing. The Canadian authorities arrested a senior Huawei executive at American request four months ago the Chinese detained a number of Canadian citizens in retaliation.Elsewhere the Netherlands announced on Friday that it will switch from Huawei to a western company for its 5G network after the US criticised the proposed involvement of the Chinese company. Other countries like Germany and India have expressed concern about using Huawei equipment as they upgrade for 5G .Two of the Chinese nationals detained overseas were working in telecommunications in Poland, one of them a Huawei employee.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Inside Huawei\u0027s new campus for workers in China Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA staff member outside the Huawei University in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusAn employee works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanAn employee enters a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanHuawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA staff member outside the Huawei University in Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusServers are seen inside Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanThe conductor waits for a train in the Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campus at Songshan Lake in DongguanA general view shows the research and development centre at Huawei\u0027s Ox Horn campusAn employee works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanEmployees works on a mobile phone production line at Huawei\u0027s factory campus in DongguanAn office building on the Huawei campus in DongguanUS intelligence has charged that Huawei is directly funded by Chinese state security. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre warns that the company posed a threat to national security. However, the organisation’s chief has also stated that this country has established the “toughest and most rigorous oversight regime in the world for Huawei”.Telecommunications is not the only field where Britain is, at times, out of step with allies when it comes to China. Beijing’s “Belt and Road”\u0026nbspprogramme is hugely contentious with accusations that it\u0026nbsppromotes “debt-trap diplomacy” – providing cheap finance and then extracting advantage when debtor countries have difficulties paying back. The most notorious example of this is Sri Lanka ceding a port, Hambantota, in return for the waiver of $1bn in loans. A number of states, including Malaysia, Nepal and Myanmar have recently pulled out of Chinese-financed programmes because of apprehension of being similarly sucked in.Last year, 27 out of 28 European Union ambassadors in Beijing (Hungary the exception) signed off a report saying the project “runs counter to the European Union’s agenda for liberalising trade and pushes the balance of power in favour of subsidised Chinese companies”.The British ambassador was one of the signatories. But in December 2016 Philip Hammond, on a visit to Beijing, spoke of how “privileged” the UK was to take part in the programme. The chancellor subsequently announced the launch of a £750m private fund, supported by the British government, and led by David Cameron, which will work with the Belt and Road initiative.The only other western European government which has talked of working with China on the scheme is Italy’s hard-right populist government, some of whose leaders are also keen admirers of Vladimir Putin.Conduct towards China is also now an internal matter in the febrile and fractured political landscape of the UK.Gavin Williamson, the defence secretary, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, Liam Fox, the international trade secretary and Penny Mordaunt, the international development Secretary, are all said to have objected strongly to the participation of Huawei in such a key sector of the UK’s communications network.All of them, it is claimed, view themselves as potential successors to Theresa May and\u0026nbspit has been suggested, appearing tough on China, they feel, will augment their leadership credentials.Suspicions about the leak have focused on the Huawei objectors. All have denied they are responsible.Senior intelligence officers ‘bemused and concerned’ at Huawei leakThe China factor has already played a part in the internecine struggle of the Conservative government. Williamson announced in February that he is going to send the aircraft carrier, Queen Elizabeth, into disputed waters of the China Seas in a display of “hard power”.The language he used resonated with echoes of “Pax Britannica” and “East of Suez”. But there was nothing intrinsically wrong with the proposal itself which reiterates the right of navigation in international waters. The growth of Chinese military power has led to alarm among neighbours in the region and beyond. Japan, India, the US\u0026nbspand Australia have formed the Quadrilateral Security group which has held large-scale naval exercises in these areas.But within hours of the defence secretary’s speech at the Royal United Services Institute,\u0026nbspTreasury officials were briefing that it will scupper a trade visit to Beijing by Hammond.China has continued to trade with other countries which had sent warships into the disputed seas as it has done with those who have placed restrictions on Huawei, albeit while making complaints to world trade bodies. Hammond is in Beijing taking part in an investment forum and has met Vice Premier Hu Chunhua who did not, according to diplomatic sources, mention Huawei.Beyond the accusations and recriminations lie\u0026nbspfundamental questions about just how dangerous Huawei is to the national security of the country where it operates.The company was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, who had formerly served in the technical engineering sector of the People’s Liberation Army. He and senior Huawei executives have connections with the Chinese military and the Communist Party.Although the company sells items like telephones and laptops, its main business is supplying core infrastructure devices which touch\u0026nbspalmost every aspect of the internet and thus could facilitate espionage.The Tory Huawei leak confirms that May’s government is doomedMinisters could have ‘phone records trawled in leak inquiry’Britain’s Huawei gamble would be a grave moral misjudgementOf course the PM is useless, she’s letting Huawei build our 5G networkHuawei: Should it be allowed in Britain’s 5G networks? Defenders of Huawei want to stress that there is no compelling evidence that the company is engaged in spying. Professor Qing Wang of\u0026nbspWarwick University, who specialises in marketing and innovation holds: “Some of the reasons put forward for this notion are weak, for example, the background of the founder of Huawei. Mr\u0026nbspRen Zhengfei once served in the People’s Liberation Army. As we know, serving in the army was one way of getting out of poverty for people in the countryside ... Huawei is the textbook case of a great company in the making unfortunately, it has fallen victim to the anti-globalisation policy and sentiment of the US and the ongoing trade war with China.”The US, however, has become increasingly bullish in confronting Huawei and the threat it is supposed to represent.At the recent meeting of the annual Munich security conference Vice President Mike Pence pointed to Huawei as an example of how “Beijing’s vast security apparatus” can have “access to any data that touches their networks\u0026nbspor equipment.”Marco Rubio, the senior Republican senator, maintains: “Huawei is a Chinese state-directed telecom company with a singular goal: undermine foreign competition by stealing trade secrets and intellectual property, and through artificially low prices backed by the Chinese government. The communist Chinese government poses the greatest, long-term threat to America’s national and economic security and the US must be vigilant in preventing Chinese state-directed telecoms companies\u0026nbsplike Huawei from undermining and endangering America’s 5G networks.”What was agreed at the NSC in London was to allow Huawei involvement at the edges of the UK’s 5G network, in non-core parts such as building antennas.

They can be managed, provided countries and companies work together,” he wrote.\u0026nbspSenior intelligence officers ‘bemused and concerned’ at Huawei leak“Huawei has had a good track record on security over the years, having taken the initiative to invest in a cyber security evaluation centre which employs an all-British monitoring team.“The company has been working hard to improve its technology and to enhance the security and reliability of its equipment.”Meanwhile, six conservative MPs\u0026nbspincluding Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, have written to culture secretary Jeremy Wright\u0026nbspabout\u0026nbsptheir concerns over Huawei.\u0026nbspThe letter, seen by The Sunday Times, said: “Having China anywhere near our communications systems poses structural risks about the level of Chinese influence in our society.“Chinese law demands that Chinese firms work with the Chinese secret services.”This week, members of the cabinet are expected to be summoned for interviews about the leak as part of the\u0026nbspformal inquiry headed by Sir\u0026nbspMark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and national security adviser.Ministers and aides were reportedly issued questionnaires requiring them to explain where they were in the hours following Tuesday’s NSC meeting.They were also reportedly\u0026nbspasked to provide details of all mobile phones in their possession and whether they spoke to the , which published the original report about the Huawei decision.Much of the attention has focused on five ministers who were said to have voiced objections to the decision: Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt,\u0026nbspGavin Williamson, Penny Mordaunt and\u0026nbspLiam Fox.Additional reporting by PAThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

elections are scheduled for 23 May and will be held unless parliament solves the current Brexit crisis.“Acts of vandalism are never justified and these recent graffiti are completely different to the normal politics of Lewes,” said Simon Burall, convenor for the Lewes Liberal Democrats.“Whatever your political affiliations, we should live in a society which respects other people’s views.”The vandalism comes as\u0026nbspfears grow over isions in political and public life in the aftermath of the 2016 Brexit referendum.The ide was starkly illustrated by the\u0026nbspmurder of MP Jo Cox\u0026nbspby a white supremacist during the campaign.A rise in reported hate crimes and in threats against MPs has added to a difficult atmosphere in local and national politics.“It’s surprising and very sad to see people expressing their political views in this thuggish and intimidating way,” said Zoe Nicholson, co-chair of the Lewes District Green Party.“The vandalism is bad enough, but using highly charged language like ‘traitors’ against political opponents is not acceptable.“We will continue to shun this kind of negative campaigning and focus on positive messages in our campaign, and we stand with other parties against any form of intimidation or extremism.”This month, parliament’s joint committee on human rights\u0026nbspheard that\u0026nbspMPs and peers were\u0026nbspexperiencing “skyrocketing” levels of abuse and death threats over Brexit and other political issues.Recent months have seen a number of high profile incidents of abuse aimed at MPs, including the pro-Remain MP Anna Soubry who was confronted by “yellow vest” protesters outside parliament.“It is really sad to see this kind of attack on democracy in our town and criminal damage done to the property of residents who are exercising their right to take part in the upcoming local elections,” Emily Clarke, a Labour candidate in the area, said.“We are experiencing a time when the country is ided on huge issues such as Brexit and people on all sides hold strong and differing views.“However, the use of this type of language aimed at local political opponents, who are genuinely working for the community in which they are standing and residents’ property is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.“As with any attack on democracy, it is important that we stand together against those who seek to intimidate us.”Sussex Police did not respond to request for comment on Sunday.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your

The board will not hesitate to enforce these rules.”Opinium Research carried out an online survey of 2,004 UK adults from 21-23 April.

calls for a ban on \u0027trophy\u0027 importsThe infamous killing of Cecil the lion has encouraged British hunters to go to South Africa and shoot dead more big cats than ever, figures reveal.Experts had believed worldwide revulsion at the shooting would mark a turning point for the endangered species and the start of a decline in “trophy” hunting.But instead the number of British\u0026nbsphunters targeting farmed lions and bringing home their body parts more than doubled in the three years after Cecil’s death, compared with the three years before, according to statistics from the global wildlife trade regulator.\u0026nbspImports after the 2015 shooting jumped to 59, against 27 before.\u0026nbspIn 2007 just four lion trophies were brought into Britain, but in 2017 the figure was 15, according to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites).Conservation experts said they were horrified that\u0026nbsplion hunting had become increasingly popular with British killers\u0026nbspand stepped up calls for the government to uphold its pledges to ban the grisly imports.Created with Sketch.Protesters demand a UK ban on imports of

against trophy hunting dressed in wildlife costumesAmerican dentist Walter Palmer\u0026nbspwas forced to go into hiding following an international outcry\u0026nbspwhen he shot\u0026nbspCecil, one of Zimbabwe’s most cherished lions.Around half the body parts brought into Britain legally are mounted lion heads, but others include whole lion bodies, skulls, feet and skins – some turned into rugs.The big cats are bred specifically to be shot by wealthy hunters in South Africa’s lucrative “canned hunting” industry.As the new figures\u0026nbspcame to light in a report by the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, conservationists dubbed Britain one of a “deadly dozen” top nations responsible for killing the most lions on canned hunting estates.The Independent has previously revealed how the government has broken pledges to halt imports.In 2017 America allowed the most imports, 84, followed by Hungary with 74.Eduardo Gonçalves, founder of the campaign group, said one safari centre had more business after Cecil’s killing because the publicity seemed to make potential trophy hunters aware of something they did not previously know existed.\u0026nbsp“It’s also possible there was a ‘rush’ because of the threat from then Defra minister Rory Stewart to shut down trophy imports before the door closed,” he said.\u0026nbspSouth Africa doubles exports of lion bones for traditional medicineMinisters break pledge to ban lion hunt trophy imports to UKDonald Trump administration lifts ban on importing lion hunt trophiesTrump quietly reverses ban on importing elephant body partsIn November 2015 Mr Stewart promised that the government would ban lion trophy imports by the end of 2017 unless there were “improvements in the way hunting takes place in certain countries, judged against strict criteria”.Mr Gonçalves said: “Britain should hang its head in shame over its role in this disgraceful industry.He added that it was time that Environment Secretary Michael Gove\u0026nbsptook action to help bring an end to this vile industry.”Last year The Independent revealed that\u0026nbsptourists were supporting “canned” lion hunting by paying farms for experiences such as feeding the animals.\u0026nbspSouth Africa has an estimated 300 or more breeding farms, housing up to 12,000 big cats. Demand for parts for “medicine” in Asia also fuels the industry.Britain should hang its head in shame over its role in this disgraceful industrySometimes they cross lions and tigers to create “ligers” which attract even higher prices from shooters.Some farms have stinking and bloody lion slaughterhouses on site and keep animals in steel transport crates too small for them to stand up or turn around in, according to a recent report in\u0026nbspThe Mail on Sunday.Last year Labour leader\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn joined conservationists in calling for an import ban, and more than 160 MPs of all parties have signed an Early Day Motion over it.Asked about a possible ban, Defra referred to a statement earlier this year by minister Therese Coffey, who said: “The government takes the conservation of species seriously.”A spokeswoman said Mr Gove would be chairing a meeting on the issue in the next fortnight, but it was not clear with whom.Cecil the lionOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t have peace inside ourselves. Each day we are following in the news: what will happen next, who will be killed, which building will be hit?” she tells\u0026nbspThe Independent from her offices at\u0026nbspGaza Sky Geeks, a tech hub in the 25-mile long militant-run strip.“The kids pay for this: the mother, the father, the family are all under pressure,” she adds.Created with Sketch.Gaza protests: Wounded patients being treated at MSF clinic Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.She says she wants to connect mothers to professional consultants specialising in psychology and parenting.“You can’t simply\u0026nbspcan’t go to a professional in our culture –\u0026nbspyour family and your husband will not support it.“People call you crazy, they blame the women for not being able to cope. It’s a taboo. You end up sunk in depression, which you take out on your kids. But with the app you can have discreet and confidential support,” she explains.The app, which is registered in Delaware, aims to break through blockades, barriers and borders and help women both within Gaza and across the Arabic-speaking world\u0026nbspon how to look after and support their children.Gazan mother shows her new app designed to help mothers in the Middle EastThrough the app, women can also discreetly book paid sessions from among their team of more than 100 professionals, who speak multiple Arabic dialects and have been carefully vetted.Ms Khodary acknowledges that Momy Helper can only reach those who can afford mobile phones and so cannot\u0026nbspfix all problems women face, but hopes it can help be part of a solution.In a trial run last year, Momy Helper paired up with Oxfam to provide free support\u0026nbspsessions for mothers who could not afford to pay or did not dare ask their husbands.In Gaza, where few have bank accounts or credit cards, women can pay for the $15 hour-long sessions in person.A year on, people in Gaza are losing hope in the ralliesThe app, which is available on Google Play,\u0026nbspalso provides basic questionnaires to help identify what issues the user is facing and then direct them to the correct free advice in Arabic.Ms Khodary hopes in the future to use artificial intelligence to better improve the interaction.For now, they have step-by-step guides of what to expect each month with their new child, and how best to improve the child\u0027s development at each key stage.Gazan protesters head to border protests as Israeli forces fire tear gas on anniversary of Great March of ReturnAfter hearing some of the worst stories from\u0026nbspwomen who have reached out to Momy Helper, Ms\u0026nbspKhodary\u0026nbspalso wants to pair up with charities to improve the gender-based violence section of the app and blog.Gender-based and domestic violence is increasing in Gaza, according to a rights group, which says\u0026nbspit is driven by soaring unemployment and poverty rates among Gaza’s trapped 1.8 million population.\u0026nbspAccording to the United Nations,\u0026nbspmore than half of women in Gaza have experienced violence at home, while nearly 80 per cent have reported being psychologically abused. Depression is also thought to be on the rise.\u0026nbspMs Khodary hopes her app can, in some way, support some women across the Arab world going through this.\u0026nbspNour al-Khodary, founder of Momy Helper, says she hopes it will grow into a business that will provide employment opportunities for war-ravaged Gaza (Bel Trew)“Sometimes mothers just need someone to hear them. We can’t provide professional therapy, but our consultants try to give them support on how they can better deal with their issues,” she says.“With severe cases we encourage them to seek professional therapy and we try to put them\u0026nbspin touch with facilities to help with that,” she adds.Ms Khodary\u0026nbspsays she\u0026nbspfirst came up with the idea in 2014 after having her son Bassem when she was briefly living in Chicago as her husband, who had secured a Fulbright scholarship, was finishing his Masters in Architectural Engineering.A long way away from home, Ms Khodary turned to the wealth of childcare literature and support available in the US.Momy Helper website)“This shocked me and I started posting on Facebook about what I had learned,” she adds.She initially received angry backlash from friends who thought she was judging them.UN urges restraint as truce ends fighting between Gaza and IsraelOvernight cross-border fire crushes hopes of an Israel-Gaza ceasefireGaza witnessing most severe crackdown on dissent in decade: AmnestyIsrael pounds Gaza with airstrikes after rocket fire targets Tel AvivBut that changed to a stream of questions when she put up videos showing examples of positive results from her little boy Bassem.“Then I start thinking about connecting mothers with professional consultants, I realised there was nothing for mothers speaking Arabic,” she says.Through Gaza Sky Geeks, a Mercy Corps-supported initiative that runs a coding academy, she put together a 10-person team to build the app. In 2017 she came second in a region-wide competition in Istanbul for best start-up in the Middle East and North Africa.Khodary runs the app\u0026nbsp(Bel TrewThe Independent)But the problem now is funding. Ms Khodary secured a small injection of cash from angel investors at the start, who gave her around 10 per cent of what was needed.But two years on she has had to drop her team and is now running the business entirely on her own.She registered the app in Delaware and with a US bank, knowing foreign investors would be nervous about money going into Gaza. Right now, she is looking into crowdfunding options.TrewThe Independent)The working mother hopes to run the app as a business, so she can create work back in Gaza where youth unemployment has soared past 70 per cent and only 19 per cent of women of working age have jobs:\u0026nbspthe highest female jobless rate in the world“My first dream is that I can reach every woman in the Arab world that needs the support that Momy\u0026nbspHelper can offer,” she says.“But I have a bigger dream, to be the first female investor in Palestine, to grow my business and earn enough to be able to invest in other start-ups to help others achieve their goals.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No wonder “people’s vote” Remainers are outraged at their former figurehead’s betrayal.Is there anything this odious shapeshter won’t do for a first-class seat aboard the publicly funded gravy train And why  believe another word he utters THE Tories have only one viable future — as the party that enthusiastically delivers a proper Brexit for .million Leavers.Too many MPs, even Cabinet ministers, fail to grasp it. They are still ­nostalgic for the Cameron era. But the referendum changed all that.It is a fundamental error of liberal Tories and Remainers generally to think a meaningful Brexit is a surrender to the Right.  A third of ethnic minority voters backed Leave, like a third of Labour voters.Delivering Brexit and upholding our democracy is the most noble act any Tory can now carry out.The price of refusal will be vast. As Nigel Farage will prove to them next month.THE Tories’ failure on crime is shameful.They slashed police numbers to  balance the books. It seemed safe as crime kept falling. Now we know that, among other problems,  cuts went too far.Murders, kne crimes, robberies and sex offences are soaring. Yes, the  homicide rate was higher under Labour. But the Tories, the party of law and order, have no decent excuses left.Each depressing crime stat is a le ruined or ended. The Tories have been in power nine years. It’s down to them.NOW we have proof that housing expert Roger ­Scruton was  stitched up by an unethical Corbynista hack, the Government should reinstate him immediately.It’s not just that they need his talent. It would show they will no longer roll over for “woke” Twitter mobs hell-bent on destroying blunt-spoken Conservatives.We won’t hold our breath, though. It will require a level of courage from Downing Street we have lost hope of seeing.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Santos had identied Kate McCann as an MI agent and claimed it explained her daughter’s disappearance.He claimed Maddie’s dad Gerry was also a potential spy.Writing in Sol, which sells to thousands every week, he fuelled the hurtful claims saying: “This would explain the immediate dispatch to Portugal of a representative of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and future Prime Minister Gordon Brown.“It was said that Brown did it because he was Gerry’s schoolmate. But this explanation doesn’t wash.“The English are very formal and there’s not the cronyism there that characterises southern Europe.“A minister doesn’t send an official representative to find out about the disappearance of a little girl because he went to school with her father.”In fact Brown and Mr McCann are not believed to have been at school together, and the former Prime Minister is at  around  years older than Gerry.Disgraced ex-Portuguese police chief Goncalo Amaral, who features heavily in the new Netflix documentary on the Maddie case, claimed last year MI spies helped to cover up her death and disappearance.He said British secret agents “for sure had an involvement” in her vanishing.Kate and Gerry McCann have spoken in the past about the hurt speculation and conspiracy theories have caused to the family.Family spokesman Clarence Mitchell said their refusal to take part in new Netflix series ‘The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann’ was based on their belief it may encourage conspiracy theorists and would do nothing to help with the ongoing search for her.Kate insisted from the outset her daughter had been abducted and she and her husband took Amaral to court over his claims in controversial  book ‘The Truth of the Lie’ that they had covered up her accidental death in their apartment.Mr Mitchell revealed last year in an interview one of the “most ridiculous” conspiracy theories he had ever heard was that Maddie was born as the result of a government cloning project.Gerry said two years ago of the hurt fake accusations had caused them: “I’m sure it is a very small minority of people who spend their time doing it, but it has totally inhibited what we do.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000485794989.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"blonde vladimir putin national guard wins beauty contest","story":"Mum-of-one Anna Khramtsova topped a list of ,-plus stunning entrants to win the military beauty pageant.The -year-old, who paints her nails to match her gun, says she serves stylishly within the ,-strong Russian National Guard, set up by Putin.But Anna said she routinely bats off sexism in the force, adding that she only decided to enter the Beauty of the National Guard contest after pressure from colleagues.Now the law graduate has been voted the most beautul female guard by almost , Russians.Anna is from a military and law enforcement family, with her father in the army and police for  years and her mother also in unorm.The law graduate, from Yekaterinburg, said: I am proud to continue the dynasty.“I do get to hear those old jokes about blondes in service, but I ignore them -

And it’s arrived just in time. The North Sea is running out of gas while we’re still heavily dependent on it. % of us use it to heat our homes and over % cook on gas hobs. More than half of our gas is already imported and that’s going to rise to % in just ten years – more and more of it coming from Russia.The further the gas travels, the greater its carbon footprint sowe really care about carbon emissions, we should get it out of the ground beneath our feet.Yet the very campaigners who say they care about climate change are demanding an end to fracking saying it causes earthquakes.These tiny tremors can hardly be felt on the surface and they’re nothing compared to quarry blasting, pile-driving or the ground shakes caused by other construction projects. They are not what any normal person would call an earthquake. They are what the experts call “micro-seismic events”, small movements in the ground below a magnitude of  on the Richter scale that occur naturally  times a year in the UK. You can’t really feel a tremor until it reaches level  and earthquakes don’t usually cause damage at anything under . Even at that level, “earthquakes” rarely make the headlines because they aren’t news. That’s until they were linked to fracking.America has safely fracked over a million wells, become energy independent and has seen the largest reduction in carbon emissions on the planet all because of shale gas.In America, though, fracking doesn’t have to pause unless it reaches on the Richter Scale. In the UK, it’s .. This ultra-low level was introduced to reassure people that this was being done belt-and-braces, but it was always intended to move the level once we got going. It was never meant to be cast in stone.But that is what environmental lobby groups are now demanding and that is who Government seems to be listening to. They are refusing even to review the level at which fracking has to pause and without a review, as the Government knows, it will be almost impossible for the industry to develop.When Cuadrilla, the shale gas company based in Preston, fracked at the end of last year, the highest magnitude they recorded was .. It measured .mm of surface movement per second, the measurement that’s used by the rest of the construction industry which stops work when they cause anything more than mm of movement.Less than mm! If you applied that to any other industry, we wouldn’t be driving buses, trams, lorries, building houses, schools or hospitals.Like so many other campaigns waged by green charities and pressure groups, a tiny fact is taken out of context, used to scare the living daylights out of people and then turned into a lucrative click-and-donate income stream – all in the name of stopping climate change.Butenvironmental groups like Extinction Rebellion really want to reduce carbon emissions then they should campaign to get fracking going in Lancashire, Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire rather than gluing themselves to trains and buildings in London.Instead, activists and campaigners are doing everything they can to stop the industry. This isn’t just affecting the shale gas companies, but the many hundreds of small, local businesses that have invested heavily in getting ready for shale based on the Government’s previous support for it. These businesses are now facing an uncertain future.As the man in charge of Business and Energy in the UK, Greg Clark, should really start listening to those people who care about our energy security and prosperity rather than groups that want jeopardise our future by shutting down our industry and manufacturing in the name of climate change. VLADIMIR Putin’s Russia provided  per cent of all the liquefied natural gas shipped into Britain in .And the UK is even buying in the gas from as far way as Peru – as North Sea reserves run dry. Fracking chiefs said it made a mockery of campaigners demanding that fracking is killed off to tackle carbon emissions.Cuadrilla chief Francis Egan said: “These ships create a far higher carbon footprint thanshale gas were to be extracted here in the UK and piped into the local grid.“If the politicians really want to ban something they should start with LNG imports not domestic shale gas.”Official figures show Russia delivered . billion cubic metres of LNG - gas which is supercooled for transport – in ,  per cent of the total amount of a up a fth on .In all some  shipments of LNG came into the UK between January and March this year – compared with  over the same period last year. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Idealistic young voters are all ears.There is a solution to our looming energy crisis — cheap, clean shale gas. But feeble Energy Secretary Greg Clark threw it away, forcing fracking tsar Natascha Engel to quit yesterday in disgust.After nine dithering years in power, with no idea how to keep the lights on, this Government is damned now whichever way it jumps.Protesters claiming “The End Is Nigh” are swarming like angry wasps.Their claims may be simplistic and sometimes , but they have been nailed on Netflix by national treasure Sir David Attenborough and hammered home by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg.Jezza is using these crowd-pullers to turn dull carbon emissions into a glittering crusade — a national emergency no less.His Momentum Marxists are tutoring the Extinction Rebellion protesters who gridlocked London and turned -year-old Greta into a global warming superstar. The Tories have nothing to say.Gutless Clark abandoned fracking contractors who risked hundreds of million only to see Project Shale strangled at birth.Engel’s walk-out should surprise nobody. I received a frantic call from the ex-Labour MP weeks ago warning about “nonsense” rules which stop fracking at the slightest tremor.She told me: “This is a real threat to the industry and means buying more Russian gas.” Her argument doesn’t wash with Jezza’s anti-capitalist anarchists, Greta or Blue Planet’s Sir David, who between them now run UK energy policy.Arguments for shale have been drowned out by images of raging bushfires, tidal waves and an Apocalypse Now soundtrack.Saint David’s bell tolls, and it tolls for the Tories.Climate change is the issue of the day. They have thrown in the towel on this as on so much .Greta Thunberg is Sweden’s new dancing queen, upstaging gas-guzzling hypocrite Emma Thompson and treating Britain’s top ministers with withering sarcasm.They were doing NOTHING to reduce carbon emissions, she spat. In truth, Britain is leading Europe, at huge cost, in reducing carbon emissions while replacing fossil fuel with renewable energy. Wind and solar energy are replacing coal.It is also a fact, courtesy of the respected Intergovern- mental Panel On Climate Change, that global warming is not about to roast us all alive or drown us beneath stormy oceans.Polar bears are multiplying, not disappearing. Walruses are thriving, not throwing themselves off rocks.None of this washes with single-issue, black-and-white zealots who regard all inconvenient truth as the work of the Devil. I am no climate change denier. We are polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.If I ruled the world, Russia, China, India and America would not turn oceans and rivers into chemical sewers.I would ban plastic dumping, save sea le from being choked or poisoned and halt deforestation and desert- ication. But I don’t rule the world, and nor does Saint David or Greta Thunberg — or the hundreds of, let’s say, well-intentioned young folk who think paralysing London is the next best thing.Britain deserves credit for cutting carbon emissions further and faster than most EU countries.Temperatures are rising, but not by Extinction Rebellion or Miss Thunberg’s worst-case projections.Evangelical followers want an end to air travel except when they go skiing.Everything must come by sea even though shipping is a highly polluting form of transport.We must grow our own food, putting farmers in poor countries out of a job and workers here on the dole.WARREN BUFFETT, the legendary Sage of Omaha, has amassed billions putting his money where his mouth is.He thinks Britain, with its rule of law and decent, hard-working citizens is the world’s best place to invest, regardless of Brexit.He’s not alone. Once Brexit is settled, a wall of money will be unleashed by firms at home and abroad who have been sitting on the fence for three years.There is only one fly in the ointment – the prospect of anti-Semitic, US-hating, terrorist-backing Jeremy Corbyn as our next PM.Jezza’s much brighter brother Piers deserves a final say on this sudden burst of mass hysteria and Greta worship.“Listening to an ignorant, brainwashed child is deranged,” he tweets. “I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It could also hand Britain an economic boom, and reduce our dependence on energy imports from far-flung dictatorships.Cowardly Business Secretary Greg Clark is squandering this windfall by giving in to the green lobby. As Engel says — listen to the science, not just to those who shout the loudest.At least the Tories aren’t quite as bad as Jeremy Corbyn, who would ban fracking altogether and destroy hundreds of jobs in the process.It is time the Government ignored leftie posturing and turned on the shale gas taps.THE five thugs suspected of murdering Stephen Lawrence have repeatedly dodged justice. So it’s an outrage they’ve been allowed to run up nearly £million in legal aid — funded, of course, by the taxpayer.Gary Dobson and David Norris lied for  years before finally being convicted of murder, while the other three have always refused to explain their role in the racist attack on Stephen.Of course every suspect has the right to a defence, but it can’t be fair that such sums have been lavished on lawyers for these fundamentally dishonest men.Contrast this state-funded generosity with the treatment of Stephen’s grieving parents, who were denied legal aid when trying to get justice for their son.Coming hot on the heels of Shamima Begum’s legal aid windfall, this is fresh proof the system isn’t working.

Head of the RCGP Prof Stokes-Lampard said the guidance does not clearly indicate that there are exceptions to this wording, includinga claimant is appealing against the decision. Without a fit note from their GP, claimants who are awaiting the outcome of their appeal will not be able to receive ESA.They would therefore have to seek Universal Credit or Jobseekersapos Allowance, and subsequently try and meet the work-seeking requirements of those benefits, potentially endangering their health in the process.”   The guidance - letter ESAB - instructs the claimantaposs doctor that you do not need to provide any more fit notes ... for ESA purposes.

The BMA said it does not have the authority to clear, approve or otherwise sign off any DWP correspondence or policies and would see this as being clearly outside of our remit.    The RCGP said there was some ambiguity about what was said in the referenced meeting with the DWP and the department did not keep written records of the discussions.

The spokesman said: We have regular discussions with the BMA and RCGP to ensure we deliver effective support to disabled people and those with health conditions. The wording of this letter was discussed as part of these meetings, as both organisations confirm, as was the release of the final letter.

Last week porky pooch George checked into the Gables Farm in Plymouth after tipping the scales at kg. The massive malmute had ballooned after, his previous owners claimed, their neighbours began throwing pasties and pies over the garden fence. While the chubby canine has won admirers for his impressive size and the nickname aposGeorgie Porgieapos, it is no laughing matter. The huge hound must shed kg to reach the ideal weight for a dog of his size.    All that weight is a big strain on his heart, organs and joints, explained Ruth Rickards, deputy manager at the kennels. He already has a really sore leg. George has been placed on a strict diet consisting of specialist dog food that costs around £ a month.    If he stays off the pasties and follows an exercise regime that has Ruth walking him in the early and late hours to avoid the sun, it is hoped George will be suitably svelte in nine months time. The dog handler continued: It takes quite a long time to help a dog properly, but we have to do it otherwise he could die.    We have to get George eating properly. There is always a bit of resistance to begin with, especially with the ones which have eaten things like burgers. I mixed a special bit of chicken in with his food so heaposd eat it. Heaposs already lost half a kilo in a week.    While George is the heaviest dog to stay at Gables, he is not the first with a weight problem. Other chunky characters include aposBopper the Whopperapos and aposHattie the Fattyapos.    George is kgheavier than Bopper was when he arrived and kgheavier than Hattie.

But it did not satisfy her curiosity which was instilled in her by her mum Christine who passed away when Victoria was just .   She told the Manchester Evening News : From as long as I can remember I always wanted to know what was beyond where I was.I was in a small town. I was always looking for something more. We were a typical British family, when we went on holiday we would always go to Spain or Greece. Iaposd be asking my dad aposwhataposs beyond here, whataposs further away apos The situation made me want to make sure I enjoyed le. In Manchester I had a job, plenty of money coming in.

Initially they took the standard path of looking to buy a house and a family car - but given Sydneyaposs extortionate house prices, they thought they could raise their daughter a bit dferently.    Victoria gave birth to Anaya  months ago and the couple decided it was time to move out of Sydney, finding a plot of lands in the middle of a mountain deep in the bush -  minutesapos drive from the nearest property. She added: Most people come here when they need a break, itaposs space for the weekend. We didnapost want a le that we needed space from. We wanted to live together as a family. The pair built a geodesic dome and now spend time living between that and their Toyota Coaster van, which allows them to travel around and go near the coast when it gets too hot during the summer months. Living off-grid means the family feel aposcalmerapos and aposbetterapos, she said - rather than the sound of constant traffic, the only noises come from kangaroos, goats and deers roaming around. Rather than go shopping or order takeaways, the family spend time apossitting with themselvesapos, going on walks, meditating and making conversation.    We want to minimise the impact on the environment. We feel more connected. Before it was a pain when it rained, but when you rely on the shower to wash yourselves, it makes you feel connected to nature, being in the environment, Victoria said. Despite living so remotely, the pair stay connected on the internet through G. Victoria now works as a social media consultant, advising smaller businesses and start-ups. Itaposs a job which she can do from anywhere. My job lends itself to this lestyle. We want to inspire people as well. You donapost have to go into an office.

Freddie Cook celebrated becoming a medical marvel by eating his favourite burger with two hands for the first time. The lad was given his new arm days before his eighth birthday and was thrilled to be able to pick up his beloved hamburger — with added ketchup — at his birthday party. The arm is the first medically approved prosthesis in Britain which allows for precise and delicate movements that other prosthetic hands cannot do.    The device weighs less than a bag of sugar and has enabled active Freddie — who was born without a right hand — to be able to grip the handlebars of his favourite scooter and climb with his friends. He has even enjoyed playing with a toy with his pet dog Lacie. Last week, he carried both his book bag and lunchbox out of the school gates - shouting to his mum, Suzy Cook, ‘Look what I can do now mum!’. Suzy, , said the device has completely changed the le of her son.  She said: “It is brilliant. Freddie has become much more conscious about his hand recently so this is incredible, he really wanted to be able to eat a burger just like all of his friends. “As soon as he put on the arm he realised what to do, it was immediate. It will change his le.” Freddie lives with Suzy, his sister Megan, , and Suzy’s fiancee Nathan Darlick, , and was fitted with the £k arm which was self-funded by his family. He has been described as a ‘tech pioneer’ by Open Bionics — the company who create the ‘hero arms’ — as the world’s youngest user of a multi-grip bionic arm.    When Freddie was born Suzy was told by private doctors it would be ‘over  years’ before technology became available which could replicate the movements of fingers. However, Freddie’s dream was fitted with the bionic limb on March  — two days before his eighth birthday. The budding youngster had tried a prosthetic hand in the past but Suzy described it as ‘doll-like’ with no movement. Finally Suzy spotted Tilly Lockey — a -year-old girl who is the ambassador for Open Bionics and recipient of two ‘hero’ arms — on Good Morning Britain and realised this prosthetic was exactly what her son needed. She said: “We had already begun the process of looking into private options but I remember spotting Tilly on television. “She could do so much with her hands. I never thought at that stage anything could be done because of his age. “When I found out Open Bionics decided to take him on as the youngest in the world I could not believe it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"grief stricken dad 45 took","story":"NewsGrief-stricken dad, , took own le after mum and twin brother diedBarry Gill was discovered dead by his brother at their family home in Hull - days after a failed suicide attemptShareByTom Kershaw:,  APR NewsBarry Gills personal problems overcame him in the end, a coroner said \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA grief-stricken dad took his own le after struggling to come to cope with a double family tragedy, an inquest heard. Barry Gill, described by friends as jolly, changed when his mother and twin brother Mark died in the space of four years. The -year-old from Hull was also a carer for his father who had been diagnosed with dementia, which he found hard to cope with, reports Hull Live.Barry was found dead at home by his brother - two days after a failed suicide attempt on October  last year. A coroneraposs court heard how Barry was struggling to cope with the loss of his twin and mother.    Paying tribute, his older brother Andrew Gill, , said: Barry was always joking and messing around. He had no bottom teeth so he used to pull his bottom lip up to his nose. He was really jolly and laughing but after his twin brother Mark died about four years ago, it really hit him hard and he changed. Our mother died in March last year and it really shocked Barry because he was really close to mum. We all were, and there were nine siblings in total so we are a big family, and then we all took it in turns to look after dad when he was diagnosed with dementia, but Barry was his carer. Andrew told the court he found his brother dead at the family home after a downstairs window had to be broken to get inside the house. Barry, who could not read or write, but was a real dab hand at fixing anything, had been handed over to mental health teams by Humberside Police officers after the failed suicide bid at his neighbouraposs home. The inquest heard he spoke with psychiatrists at around am who believed the dad-of-two showed symptoms of an adjustment disorder after his father had been taken into hospital for treatment. Dr Graham Harkness said Barry told workers at Miranda House he was not intending to take his own le and just wanted to go home to sleep so he was deemed eligible to leave.    A mix-up with the follow-up appointment written in a social workeraposs diary resulted in no one going to see Barry the next day. Less than  hours later, he had taken his own le. John Duckles, a co-author of the serious incident investigation report into Barryaposs death, told the hearing: Further assessments were made and opportunity was missed to intervene. He said the Humber Teaching NHS Foundation Trust was looking at betters way to use electronic diaries and better co-ordinate morning meetings so social workers were aware of cases they had been assigned to. Dr Laszlo Karsai, consultant histopathologist at Hull Royal Infirmary, told the hearing the medical cause of death was hanging. PC Sophie Hunt said there was no third party involvement or suspicious circumstances surrounding the death. Area Coroner Rosemary Baxter concluded Barryaposs death as suicide. She said: My reasons for this are that Barry struggled to cope with his le and coping to look after his father. He had made a previous attempt to take his own le. It was a deliberate, preplanned act but no suicide note was found. I find his many personal problems overcame him in the end.

Reds-mad Adam Spence, , and his little brother Ryan, seven, travelled over from Belfast with their mum and dad to watch their first ever Liverpool match live. But the boys were left stood outside in tears after the person they paid for tickets months in advance let them down  minutes before kick-off. While mum Angela and dad Stephen, both , desperately scrambled to try and get tickets, the boys listened in tears as Anfield roared after the first goal of their - drubbing of Huddersfield on Friday night just  seconds into the match.    Despite handing over £ for four tickets nearly a year ago, the family missed the match and had to go back to their Travelodge empty handed. From their Liverpool hotel, Angela told the Echo : Itaposs frustration. We are stuck in this hotel. It has been awful. Weaposre both  at the end of this year and this is my husbandaposs first time coming over and this was his first game. It was even worse because we came to the ground, then when the match started and the goal went in and the cheering and when they were singing Youaposll Never Walk Alone - they were in bits.  The family arrived last Thursday April  and planned to make a weekend of it, ing home to Belfast on Monday. Between flights, tickets, club merchandise, taxis and meals, Angela estimates the trip has cost them the best part of £, - and they spent most of it sat in their hotel feeling let down. Angela and Stephen knew a weekend trip to the match wouldnapost come cheap, so they started planning the trip in June , booking flights as early as possible to try to keep costs down. Not being able to take his boys to their first game has been a massive blow for Stephen, who works as a heating engineer, and Angela who had to see her sons in tears at the ground.    Having never been to a game, the family asked a friend to get in touch with someone who had a contact in Liverpool that was able to get tickets, and handed over £. Angela said: We ended up with the fella at home trying to find us someone. He knew a fella who knew a fella over here. We gave the cash to him in June and he passed it to a fella who passed it to a fella over here called Alex. The family agreed to meet Alex at the Derry Club near Anfield - but  minutes before the game Alex texted Stephen to say he wouldnapost be coming. Alex wrote: Hi Stephen itaposs Alex Iaposm so sorry but Iaposve just been let down with seven tickets. Iaposm f***ing fuming. I wonapost be able to meet you at the Derry Club Iaposm so so sorry. I will get your money back as soon as possible.    However, Alex quickly stopped answering his phone and two days later has not responded to dad Stephenaposs requests for his money back. Angela said: When we got to the Derry Club the boys were so psyched up. [My son] askedeverything was okay and I said it must just be the reception. That was at .pm - we had been there from pm. My little lad predicted it would be - to Liverpool. My eldest is the one who has taken it the worst.

Harry was accused of cropping his photo of the elephant so that royal fans could not see a rope around one of its hind legs.  A spokeswoman for Harry denied claims that the image was cropped deliberately so that the rope was not shown. The Sun reported that Meghanaposs due date was today. A source said: It won’t be long now. Meghan’s really excited. Of course shes nervous like any first-time mum but she and Harry can’t wait. She’s been preparing for the birth – she wants it to be as natural as possible – and so has been practising hypnobirthing and breathing techniques with Harry. It’s been a huge support having her mum by her side and now she’s just getting as much rest as she can.

The horrying stunt was revealed just two days after the Argentinian star’s grieving father Horacio, , had a heart attack and died. A detective said last night: “We’re disgusted somebody did this. “It is a very dficult time for Mr Sala’s family and they should not have to endure additional pain this shameful act will undoubtedly cause.” Striker Sala, , was being flown by private plane from Nantes in France to join his new Premier League club Cardf City on January  when it disappeared over the Channel in poor visibility.    His body was recovered  days later on February  after search teams finally found wreckage of the Piper PA- Malibu light aircraft north of Guernsey. The player’s remains were taken to the Holly Tree Lodge mortuary in Bournemouth, Dorset, before a post-mortem examination took place. Police believe the ghoul may have broken in to the morgue. An inquest on February  was told that the footballer had died from injuries to his head and upper body. The body of pilot David Ibbotson,  – a father of four – is still missing and air accident experts continue to probe how the crash happened.  Yesterday Dorset Police said: “We are aware that a picture reported to be of Mr Sala’s body has been shared on social media channels and are disgusted somebody did this. “We are investigating this incident and working with a number of ­agencies to establish how the picture was taken and who is responsible.” A source added: “One theory is that someone broke into the mortuary and took these pictures. “The image went up on Twitter but was very quickly taken down.”The revelation is another terrible blow to Sala’s mum Mercedes, sister Romina and brother Dario. On Friday his father Horacio suffered a fatal heart attack at the family home in Progreso, Santa Fe.  It also follows the arrest of Burnley FC supporter Gary Kay, , who is accused of posting sick tweets about Sala’s death. The estate agent later “apologised unreservedly” over the jibes.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs official account posted images of a relocated elephant in Malawi, a threatened rhino resting its head on a log in Africa and an extreme close-up of a critically endangered desert lion. But Harry is now facing criticism after it emerged those three animals featured on the sussexroyal Instagram account - which has five million followers - had been tranquilised before the snaps were taken so they could be moved. The prince, who will become a father very soon, has been accused of cropping his photo of the elephant so that royal fans couldnapost see a rope around one of its hind legs. A spokeswoman for Harry denied claims that the image was cropped deliberately so that the rope wasnapost shown, and said the post was not misleading.  The spokeswoman said the Duke and Duchess care deeply about conservation and the post was a personal way for them to demonstrate that. Harryaposs Earth Day post - which also features a photo of him and pregnant we Meghan Markle walking amongst towering redwood trees in New Zealand - did not explain that the animals had been sedated as they were being relocated as part of conservation projects. That bothered Instagram users who posted criticism in the comments section. The photo of the elephant - showing a man holding the animalaposs tusk - was taken in Malawi as a herd was being moved to a wildle reserve.    Field guide Frank Weitzer, who was taking photos that day, told the Mail on Sunday: We were in a floodplain and it was towards the end of July . I have a series of images – from a dferent perspective – depicting the elephant falling to the ground later on. Harryaposs caption read: When a fenced area passes its carrying capacity for elephants, they start to encroach into farmland causing havoc for communities. Here @AfricanParksNetwork relocated  Elephants to another park within Malawi to reduce the pressure on human wildle conflict and create more dispersed tourism.  It was suggested the rope wasnapost shown in Harryaposs post due to Instagramaposs formatting. However, when the same photo was posted on the kensingtonroyal Instagram account on October , , it showed the rope around the elephantaposs left hind leg. The  post quoted Harry as saying: Kester Vickery from Conservation Solutions trying to get this Bull Elephant to lie down! Map Ives, Botswana’s national rhino co-ordinator, said the photo of the rhino is also from .  Harryaposs caption read: Africa’s Unicorn, the rhino. These magnicent animals have survived ice ages and giant crocodiles, amongst other things! They have adapted to earth’s changing climate continually for over  million years. Yet here we are in  where their biggest threat is us. It is unknown when the close-up of the lionaposs eye was taken. The caption in Harryaposs post stated: Desert lions are critically endangered due partly to human wildle conflict, habitat encroachment and climate change.  % of mammals on our [planet emoji] are either livestock or humans, meaning only % remaining are wild animals. Wildle photographer Christiaan Kotze was not impressed by the post. He told the Mail on Sunday: [Harry] is on the front line and has access that very few people including professional photographers would ever dream of having. If these are really his best images he has not used the opportunity to its full extent.  Harryaposs post, which was liked by almost , people, also shows images of Botswana’s Okavango Delta, killer whales in Norway, a forest in Guyana and plastic waste on a pebbled beach. Some Instagram users posted criticism in the comments section, saying the post should have explained that the animals had been tranquilised and the reason for it, and the photo of the elephant should have showed the rope around its leg. One person wrote: Extremely disappointed when I read about the ‘backstory’ of the elephant image!!And one added: The issue is that the images were misleading. The issue is that information was edited. The issue is that a responsible person shows the true story... not to use cropped images for a pretty photo of what people aposbelieveapos is a happy, free animal. The posters actions are irresponsible and without full disclosure the cause is called into question. Some users came to Harryaposs defence, with one writing: Itaposs appalling that the amazing conservation work being done here has been twisted by the media.

MLS side New York City approached the Dons in January to open up talks with the winger.McInnes has been keen to retain Mackay-Steven.Aberdeen have also opened up contract talks with on-loan Rotherham defender Dom Ball.At the end of the season Ball’s contract expires with his parent club and McInnes aims to secure him on a permanent deal.The Dons boss confirmed there has been no development in talks with Shinnie, Mackay-Steven or Ball.Shinnie faces a battle to be fit before the end of the season having sustained ankle ligament damage in the - defeat of Kilmarnock.McInnes confirmed that could rule Shinnie out for up to six weeks. If that is the case the club skipper could have played his last game for Aberdeen as Derby boss Frank Lampard has admitted he is keen to sign him.However, McInnes has confirmed Shinnie is determined to beat the odds toto fitness for the final game of the season, away to Hibs on Sunday May  – potentially Shinnie’s farewell to the Aberdeen supporters.McInnes said: “There is ligament damage but no damage to the bone.“It is about four to six weeks but Shinnie is adamant he will be back for the last game of the season. Certainly at this stage though he is up against it.”Despite suffering the injury, Shinnie opted to stay on the pitch at Rugby Park for the remaining  minutes as the Dons had used all their substitutes.He said: “Shinnie didn’t want to come off.“We didn’t expect anything from him as Kilmarnock were down to nine men and then they went down to eight in the last throes of the game.“Shinnie was on the pitch but he never touched the ball and never really did anything. It is maybe symbolic enough that he wanted to stay on the pitch rather than be seen to come off.”The loss of Shinnie is the latest injury blow with Aberdeen set to face Rangers tomorrow with six first-team regulars ruled out.On-loan Birmingham attacker Greg Stewart , Gary Mackay-Steven , Niall McGinn , Shaleum Loganand Tommie Hobanare all out.Aberdeen will tomorrow bid for a fourth straight win over Rangers in Glasgow.Ibrox boss Steven Gerrard has added extra spice to an already tempestuous fixture by insisting the Dons raise their game when facing Rangers.On those comments, McInnes said: “We raise our game every game.“We don’t always get the results, our home form could have been better, but our away form has been second to none.“We have had six years of solid work and we have raised our game time and again against every opponent.”McInnes may have an injury-hit team but he is confident they can find a way to secure a memorable quadruple of Glasgow wins.He said: “Beating Rangers in Glasgow three times is not an easy thing to do.

It shows we can find ways.“At Ibrox tomorrow it may not necessarily be the team we would want to put out.“But we will try to put out a team that will be competitive to try to get a result despite us being the underdog.“Rangers were very good at Hearts last week and were able to score three goals away from home at a tough venue.“But our away form gives us confidence we can put in a performance that gives us a chance of getting the result we want.”McInnes was this week charged by the Scottish FA having been sent to the stand during the - Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic.He was sent off after making a gesture towards Celtic fans in reaction to sectarian abuse directed at him.

Captain Graeme Shinnie was out with an ankle injury and Mikey Devlin dropped to the bench.Manchester United loanee James Wilson was drafted in to start and Lewis Ferguson ed from suspension in midfield.The home side started positively with Ryan Kent and Tavernier sending in dangerous crosses from the right in the opening  minutes, which found no takers in the centre.Aberdeen#s first offering in attack came in the th minute when Wilson#s inswinging free-kick from the right was met by Sam Cosgrove at the back post, but from six yards the header drted wide.A minute later the Dons lost Connor McLennan to injury. The -year-old appeared to tweak his hamstring in the th minute, but the winger continued # although only for three minutes.Devlin was sent on in his place which meant Max Lowe moved to the left side of midfield from left-back and Considine shted to left-back.On  minutes a period of pressure from the Gers ended with Kent sending a low left-footed shot inches wide from  yards.The Govan outfit seemed encouraged by that spell of play and were keen to keep the ball and try to work it around the Reds. Three minutes after Kent#s shot Dons keeper Joe Lewis made a fabulous save to keep the game at -.Steven Davis jabbed a ball through which was dummied by Scott Arfield for Jermain Defoe, the on-loan Bournemouth striker was in but Lewis plunged to his right and beat away the fierce shot from  yards.After that spell of defending Aberdeen responded at the other end in the th minute as Stephen Gleeson worked the ball on to Wilson on the edge of the box, the striker danced inside a couple of challenges, but his left foot strike was straight at Allan McGregor in goal.With five minutes of the first period left the Rangers pressure continued as Defoe had a shot from just inside the area deflected wide and when the resulting corner was recycled Connor Goldson headed over Kent#s delivery from the right flank.Moments later Tavernier was released on the right side of the box, but Lewis was out to narrow the angle and smother the strike. Then Davis had a shot charged down and on the rebound former Don Ryan Jack had an effort from  yards parried away by Lewis.However, Aberdeen did manage to reach half-time with the score level, but after only three minutes of the second half they were trailing.A corner wasn#t cleared and as Nikola Katic tried to turn at the back post under pressure from Ferguson the defender hit the deck following a tangle of legs.Referee Don Robertson pointed to the spot and Tavernier confidently sent Lewis the wrong way from  yards, sending the ball into the bottom right corner.Defoe passed up a gilt-edged chance to make it two shortly before the hour. The ball was worked out to Tavernier on the right, his cross deflected off Scott McKenna and hit Lewis at the near post.The rebound fell for Defoe, but the England international hooked a volley well over from four yards.On  minutes Rangers had the ball in the net after a swt counter-attack. Tavernier chipped it beyond Lewis, but was offside after taking Defoe#s through ball.After this Aberdeen had a good spell, but creating clear chances was dficult. When the Dons got further forward the final pass, or cross from a wide area, wasn#t quite there.With  minutes to the Dons# hopes of taking something from the game were over when Rangers were awarded a second penalty.Considine was adjudged to have elbowed Katic at a corner from Davis, again Robertson pointed to the spot and the whistler then produced a second yellow card for Considine- his first came near the end of the first half for a lunge on Jack # and then a red.For the second time Tavernier scored from  yards, this time putting the spot-kick into the bottom left corner to seal the points for the Gers.Rangers: Allan McGregor, James Tavernier, Connor Goldson, Nikola Katic, Jon Flanagan, Steven Davis , Ryan Jack, Glen Kamara, Scott Arfield, Jermain Defoe , Ryan Kent .Subs not used: Wes Foderingham, Joe Worrall, Andy Halliday, Glenn Middleton.Aberdeen: Joe Lewis, Dom Ball, Andy Considine, Scott McKenna, Max Lowe, Stephen Gleeson , Lewis Ferguson, Connor McLennan , Stevie May, James Wilson, Sam Cosgrove .Subs not used: Tomas Cerny, Greg Halford, Miko Virtanen, Ethan Ross."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42577234-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42577234-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42577234-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/2.42577234-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen msp calls on labour to back plans to devolve rail services","story":"A north-east MSP has called on his political rivals to back full devolution of rail services to the Scottish Government.SNP Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart wants the support of Labour politicians.His calls came after former Labour transport minister Tom Harris – a senior adviser to the Rail Review – said infrastructure under the control of Network Rail should be transferred to a new body, answerable to the Scottish Government.Mr Stewart said: “The Rail Review gives us an opportunity for meaningful change.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14580367.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_180419rugby_02JPG.jpg","title":"ayr rugby club prepare murrayfield","story":"NewsAyr Rugby Club prepare for Murrayfield date with destiny against HeriotsThe club will bid to land a fourth Scottish Cup and complete a league and cup double this season when they head for the capital on Saturday.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR NewsAyr Rugby coach Peter Murchie and his players \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Make mine a double, writes Ron Evans.That was the cry at Millbrae when the pink and black faithful realised that their team had created the chance to win the Tennent’s Premiership and the Scottish Cup in what will be the last opportunity to achieve this feat under the current league set-up. Ayr have been there before of course in  when they won the Premiership by defeating Currie then the Cup final against Melrose with the unforgettable Cammy Taylor try in the injury time of extra time. This time, however, they take on Heriot’s in both games. Having won the epic Tennent’s Premiership play-off final against the Goldenacre outfit two weeks ago, the Nailsare again Ayr’s opponents on Saturday in the cup final at Murrayfield. It might be inappropriateto suggest that Ayr are going out to hammer the Nails on Saturday, but that is exactly what they plan to do. Now in possession of more senior cup and league medals than any other Scottish player, veteran full back Grant Anderson told some of the rookies for whom this is a first- time experience: “You think beating Heriots at Millbrae was good  “Doing it at Murrayfield will feel a hundred times better!” Skipper Pete McCallum, heading for his third cup final at Murrayfield with a won one lost one record, certainly agreed that it was great chance for the players to express themselves on the big stage. “Playing on the international pitch is always something really special so we want to enjoy the occasion and go out with a bang,” he said.  As was the case at Millbrae, there will be little to choose between the two sides, their regular league form having panned out with an away win each but in the winner-takes- all contest for the Premiership title showdown, Ayr were superior. “Yes, we are in a good place but there will be no complacency” said coach Peter Murchie. “It was a physical game and we would expect the same in the cup final. “Thankfully we didn’t pick up any injuries and we were able to give the squad a bit of a rest after the last game which has let us build gradually towards Murrayfield.” “The squad are totally motivated as you would expect from any team going into a cup final becauseyou can’t be motivated for that then I donapost know what would get you up for a game. “I have said several times to the squad that opportunities like this don’t come along very often in your career and you have to take those opportunities and make the very best of it. “Some of our squad have experienced this situation before and our senior players will be a big part of what we achieve but we have some really exciting young talent as well so we will give it our best shot and hopefully have a great finish to what has already been a memorable season.” It has indeed been memorable andAyr do add a fourth Scottish Cup success to the Tennent’s Premiership title, then the call will likely be for trebles not doubles all round. Good luck. Good luck.A ticket for the Millbrae breakfast,coach travel and entrance to the match is £.Other options include £ for match ticket and coach travel and £ for the match ticket only.

The cash withdrawals took place between July  and May  and Cowan helped herself to more than £, of the patient’s savings. The Scottish Social Services Councilheard how the offence came to light when the victim, known only as ‘AA’ and requiring “multiple care needs” decided to alert care home staff, believing that the money would never be repaid.When shocked senior staff at Glebe House found out about the incidents they called the police and reported the matter to the Care Inspectorate and the SSSC. But in the subsequent investigation, Cowan was understood to have shown “limited insight and remorse” in respect of her actions. The victim gave evidence during the hearing, telling the SSSC’s Fitness to Practise Panel how, during a conversation with Cowan, she told her she was “worried about money.” The victim initially offered Cowan money but that invitation was declined. However, in a later conversation, around a week later, Cowan, who had no previous record of wrong-doing with the SSSC, indicated that she “needed a certain amount of money.” On this occasion Cowan was given the lady’s bank card and PIN and the service user believed £ would be withdrawn. In the weeks and months thereafter, a similar scenario took place “several times.” Several cash withdrawals took place from the ATM at the Co-operative, Dalmellington. Cowan then came up with a “sob story” about a family member’s Christmas present and again, the patient handed over her bank card. This pattern continued and the patient did not report the matter at that point because Cowan “promised to pay it back” and she “believed her.” However, the victim’s concerns grew and she reported the matter to other members of staff after fearing she wasn’t going to get her money back. Another witness claimed she was “shocked” that a carer had taken a resident’s bank card and withdrawn money for her own use. During the investigation process Cowan started to make repayments of the outstanding amount. At the hearing in Dundee the victim was described as a “lonely and vulnerable inidual” but “very switched on” and an “impressive witness” who gave her evidence in a forthright manner and was found to be both “credible” and “reliable.” In their written judgement the SSSC found Cowan’s conduct fell “far below the standards” expected, labelled her actions were “serious and deliberate” and amounted to a “signicant breach of trust.” The Panel also stated they could not be satisfied that Cowan had “acknowledged the gravity” of her conduct, or that she demonstrated “meaningful regret.” The judgement concluded: “A Removal Order is the only sanction that will provide an adequate safeguard against yourepeating your misconduct. “It is the only sanction that will ensure that service users are not placed at risk of harm and will maintain public confidence in social services and the SSSC as regulator.” Cowan was neither present nor represented at the hearing. A spokesperson for East Ayrshire Council said: “We are aware of the situation and understand that care home management acted appropriately in conjunction with Scottish Social Service Council and Care Inspectorate when they learned about allegations against the member of staff. “Through our contract management arrangements we actively engage with all the care homes in East Ayrshire to provide assurance in respect of the quality of service provided to residents.” The Post did contact Glebe House Care Home for a response but did not receive one.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrEast Ayrshire CouncilSocial servicesDundee"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14904281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18944840.jpg","title":"ayr united startlet tipped make","story":"NewsAyr United startlet tipped to make big time -he avoids video game FortniteLuke McCowan won praise from boss Ian McCall after a brilliant debut in Ayrs - win at Firhill on Saturday.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsMcCowan is being tipped for big things\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIan McCall has tipped Ayr Unitedaposs newest star to make a name for himself - as long as he stays off computer games.

But historic County Buildings is also a modern workplace housing  staff delivering services for more than , people in South Ayrshire. From the grandeur of Provost Helen Moonie’s luxurious sea-view office to the dingy corridors of the basement, the  landmark is full of character. Our Local Democracy Reporter went on a ‘behind the scenes’ tour guided by council depute chief executive Douglas Hutchison. Looking around County Buildings, it is clear to see that history speaks through the detailed decor oozing out of every cornice. Two sweeping staircases sparkle with stunning stained-glass windows which hark back to the time when the whole of Ayrshire was ided into burghs. Each burgh had a crest, which are intricately etched into the glass. They include Ayr, Irvine, Troon Prestwick, Darvel, Kilmarnock, Largs and Saltcoats among others.  Nowadays Ayrshire is ruled by three separate councils but the County Buildings design still echoes a past when Ayr reigned supreme. Its former position of housing the entire admininstrative work of the county is reflected in its extravagant architecture. The main council chambers where all major decisions take place have sleek slide-back oak  – which open into other rooms. The chambers could have one of the finest council views in the country overlooking the Firth of Clyde. Every committee room has an open fireplace, which would have warmed the wind-battered building before central heating. Another room has a glass display cabinet showing a town clerk wig and Royal Burgh of Ayr Truncheon among other artefacts. Councillors have their own swish ‘members library’ with newspapers, tea and coffee. The details of meetings taking place behind closed doors are still written in old-fashioned chalk on the front of blackboards. Showing us around, Mr Hutchison said: “This the front face of the council where the council business takes place.” The director of people also took us to a secret location – a secure vault – which opens into a large room for storingpostal votes.Now there is a mission to make the historic building more up to date to adhere with current workday practices. The original architecture is in conflict with the needs of a al workplace where open-plan is the norm. Attempts to fit more people into open- plan space means walls must come down but due to the listed status of the landmark all alterations must be carefully managed. There is also a need to make room for staff coming from the John Pollock centre and soon-to-be demolished Burns House. In contrast to the splendid offices and committee meeting rooms on the first floor, a newly renovated office for employee services staff features skylights and a purple meeting pod. Mr Hutchison said: “It is a lovely building. But trying to fit a modern working environment into an old building is not easy. There is a lot going on to make it more modern. We need to make more efficient use of space. The days of everybody turning up at their desks are gone. We have to work more flexibly.” Mr Hutchison showed us empty offices stripped bare, which are currently awaiting a facelt. Money to maintain the seat of power is ongoing with windows getting replaced along with other repairs. Mr Hutchison said: “There is a programme of general investment in the building.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsMuseumsKilmarnockIrvineCosmetic surgeryFirth of ClydeTroonDarvelPrestwickLargsSaltcoats"},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams ayr stay open department","story":"NewsDebenhams in Ayr to stay open as department store announces list of  stores to closeThe department store giant has revealed the first list of stores set to close early next year.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsDebenhams is an anchor store for Ayr Central \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailScores of jobs have been spared after Debenhams confirmed their outlet in Ayr Central shopping mall is to survive an initial axe.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilArmed forcesAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-with-multiple-sclerosis-shares-her-story","story":"A Galashiels woman with multiple sclerosishas shared her story to show support for MS research in Scotland.Kirsty Bennett, , works in finance and was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS in .Today marks the beginning of MS Awareness Week.MS Society Scotland are raising support for research that hopes to find a cure for the condition.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy.

He compounded his blunder by holding back on criticising Boris Johnson during the referendum campaign. His legacy is in shreds.Sturgeon stands at a similar crossroads to the one Cameron faced in  when he announced an In Out referendum. Only a very small proportion of voters support an early indyref and opinion polls almost unormly show a majority is against secession.

She also made a concession to her partyrsquos Left by proposing changes to the SNPrsquos economic case - approved yesterday at their conference - to replace the pound with a new currency, a hugely risky move. Like Cameron, she was appeasing her own side.However, senior SNP figures believe the circumstances could exist for a Section  deal. Look at the small print of Sturgeonrsquos statement to MSPs last week. She wants to pass a framework bill - setting out the rules of a possible referendum - before the end of the year. She said the Tory Government ldquomight soon be out of office. She said she would seek agreement on a transfer of power at an ldquoappropriate point.Sturgeon believes Theresa Mayrsquos chaotic Government will fall by the end of the year, to be replaced by a minority Labour administration led by Jeremy Corbyn.

It is party activists north of the border, not in London, who have been shouted at and dismissed as ldquored Tories. Scottish Labour is much more hostile to indyref than Corbyn and his allies.Richard Leonard could insist that Scottish Labour sets the policy on an independence referendum for the UK party.

A sharp pinstripe suit, crisp pocket hankie, pressed white shirt, silk monotone tie. But the clothes are just a front.Douglas spends his le among the most dangerous, predatory offenders - rapists, murderers, serial killers. Men who live behind masks - masks of sanity, masks of Mr Nice Guy until itrsquos too late, real masks put over their faces at night before they kill.The suit and tie that Douglas wears, itrsquos a mask too - it gives him authority when he sits across the prison visiting table from criminals constantly searching for signs of weakness to exploit, one eye ever hunting for a victim.Douglas developed the science - some would say art - of criminal profiling. A profiler takes every shred of evidence from a crime scene and uses it to develop a picture of who the killer is - at times the results can be astounding, pegging with chilling accuracy the age, race, profession, marital status, personality and location of the offender. Douglas looked at the crimes of Jack the Ripper and said with certainty that the murderer - who to this day remains unknown - lived slap-bang in the middle of his killing grounds in the east end of London. Most serial murders start killing close to home - their lsquocomfort zonersquo. As Douglas says: \"If you want to understand the artist, look at his art.\"The method of killing is often revelatory about the killerrsquos personality. If a victim is found strangled from behind, then most likely the killer knew them - few people, even the most psychopathic, would look into the eyes of someone they knew as they died. Multiple wounds to a victimrsquos face and upper body  Then therersquos probably a personal motive. Revenge, perhaps - jealousy.The key to Douglas unlocking the secrets of the criminal mind was a series of interviews he conducted with notorious offenders beginning in the s - some call it the Golden Age of Serial Killing - and continuing to this day. He interviewed the likes of David Berkowitz - the Son of Sam - Charles Manson, Ed Kemper, John Wayne Gacy, Gary Heidnik, Ted Bundy and Richard Speck. Between them, these men alone are responsible for the deaths of nearly  people. Douglasrsquo new book lsquoThe Killer Across the Tablersquo explains how these interviews taught him what makes a killer tick - why killers kill. Little wonder, then, that he was the inspiration for the character of FBI chief Jack Crawford in Silence of the Lambs, and had his career immortalised in the Netflix crime series Mindhunter, about tofor a second season.At the heart of understanding the worst offenders - serial killers, sex murderers, repeat rapists - lie three simple words, says Douglas: lsquoManipulation. Domination. Controlrsquo. These are the prime motivators. But why do those three simple words drive such men  The answer lies somewhere in their childhood for itrsquos there that empathy seems to have been drained from them, and empathy is the one thing which makes us human. Nearly all suffered abuse of one kind or another as children. \"They are all predators, \" says Douglas, \"and all grew up without forming trusting bonds with other human beings during their formative years\".Douglasrsquo work has led him inevitably to ask big questions about le, specically lsquoare some people born evil rsquo. When it comes to the nature versus nurture debate, Douglas says: \"I would argue that, while no-one who does not have certain inborn tendencies toward impulsivity, anger, and or sadistic perversions is going to evolve into a predator because of bad upbringing, there is no doubt in my mind that those possessing such inborn tendencies can be pushed along the path to predation by negative influences as they grow up and mature.\"As an example, he points to one of the most notorious serial killers in history - Ed Kemper, the so-called Co-ed Killer who murdered his grandparents when he was , then went on to kill a series of young hitchhikers, and his mother. He stands six foot nine, weighs  pound, and has an IQ of .In order to understand the very essence of Kemperrsquos crimes, Douglas tried to unravel the killerrsquos fantasy le, his lsquoemotional reasonsrsquo for murder. Like many such men, Kemper had a dficult relationship with an emotionally cold mother. None of Kemperrsquos victims were treated sadistically. Unlike many other killers, it wasnrsquot torture or humiliation that motivated him. Kemper told Douglas that he was lsquoevicting them from their bodiesrsquo so he could be with them after death. He was lonely - and like all violent and sexual offenders he was also a narcissist. The same psychopathology crops up again and again in Douglasrsquo work: humiliation or abuse in childhood leaves a young man, with a high sense of his own importance, unfit for the world - incapable of ing in work or a relationship - and this piles on more humiliation to their already fragile sense of self they are raw with anger and sensitive to any slight empathy has been expunged from them. Killing becomes an act which gives them power, control, domination.Serial offenders - paedophiles, rapists, killers - are also serial manipulators of the authorities. Lying isnrsquot just second nature - itrsquos fun. \"On one of his court-mandated visits to a state psychiatrist Ed Kemper had the head of his latest victim, a -year-old girl, in the trunk of his car,\" says Douglas. \"During that particular interview, the psychiatrist concluded he was no longer a threat to himself or others and recommended his juvenile record be sealed.\" Suffice to say, Douglas does not hold to the idea that such offenders can be rehabilitated.However, the deep-seated narcissism and inadequacy of serial offenders also makes them easy to manipulate. In his interviews with criminals, Douglas tries to maintain control of the situation as a figure of authority - hence the FBI suit and tie - while still allowing the killer to feel a sense of power and control. In his first interview with David Berkowitz, Douglas told him that another multiple murder had written to police saying lsquohe wants to be powerful like yoursquo. Berkowitz immediately relaxed and said to Douglas: \"What do you want to know \"When Douglas interviews assassins - like James Earl Ray who shot Martin Luther King - he sits them lsquofacing the window or door because they tend to be paranoid and will be distractedthey canrsquot psychologically escape when stressed by the interviewrsquo. During an interview with Charles Manson, all of five foot two, \"he climbed up onto the back of a chair at the head of the table so he could lord it over us from a superior position, just as he used to sit on top of boulder to preach to his lsquofamilyrsquo of followers\".Douglas says his goal in all these interviews is lsquoto turn on the DVDrsquo inside the minds of these men. All serial offenders have rich, though dark, fantasy lives - they vividly replay their crimes in their minds. Douglas takes hours leading offenders through humdrum small talk and le history until they begin speaking freely about the crimes they committed. Thatrsquos when Douglas gets closest to honesty and can really pick apart why a killer killed.That moment can be lsquoalmost like a metamorphosesrsquo, he says. He describes one child killer, Joseph McGowan, transforming before his eyes as he began to talk openly of his crimes. \"His physical appearance seemed to change before my eyes,\" he said. \"His eyes were unfocused as he looked beyond me. I could tell he was looking completely inward - back a quarter of a century. I could sense he was clicking back to the one story that had never left his mind.\"Most lsquoordinaryrsquo people who commit murder donrsquot take pleasure in the act itself - eventhey hate the person theyrsquove killed. However, the sexual or serial murderer does. McGowan took extreme pleasure in killing. \"The gratication and emotional fulfilment of the act went through to the brutal murder itself and his ability to destroy something.\" When Douglas asked McGowan to show the expression that was on his face at the time of the killing, lsquohis face contorted into what I would characterise as an intense, malevolently satisfied grimacersquo.With such killers lsquothe fixation was with the act itself, not the personality or specicity of the victimrsquo. In other words, a killer like McGowan - who was also a social inadequate with a domineering mother - would have killed anyone to satisfy his urge to murder, a child was just an easier victim than an adult woman, or even a man.\"The only real fantasy here was a fantasy of power,\" Douglas added. \"For a person with criminal tendencies who perceives he has little power or control over his own le, murder embodies the ultimate power.\"Therersquos one consistent trait among all serial predators, says Douglas, and thatrsquos lsquotwo emotional concepts constantly warring within them. One is a feeling of grandiosity and entitlement. The other is a deep-seated and pervasive sense of inferiority.rsquoEven though their actions may appear insane, serial offenders are not mad. Douglas cites the case of Dennis Rader, the BTK killer - BTK standing for bind, torture, kill - who murdered entire families. When it seemed like his we suspected him of aberrant behaviour, Rader was able to stop killing for years before starting again. \"This layoff proved to me Raderrsquos sanity and rationality,\" says Douglas.Most serial offenders display lsquothe homicidal triadrsquo when young - bed-wetting, fire starting and cruelty to animals. The psychology of the crime scene also points to the psychology of the criminal. Is it organised  In other words, was the crime well planned, is there little evidence left behind, was the getaway effective  Or was it disorganised - meaning the killer might be young, less experienced, maybe under the influence of drink or drugs.Serial offenders are also born to compartmentalise - in a way that no normal person could. John Wayne Gacy had  boys buried under his house, yet he went about his le as a happily married man, active in local politics and successful in his business le. \"Predators like these exist on two distinct psychic planes,\" says Douglas.\"Serial killers are constantly on the hunt, some of them almost nightly,\" Douglas adds. \"The hunt is a key component of the fantasy and often just as fulfilling as the crime itself.\"Nearly all such offenders see themselves as wronged by the world, and often blame their acts on some catalyst which set them off - being jilted, losing a job, friends shunning them, a terrible childhood, exposure to pornography, or a even dog barking next door according to the Son of Sam. Often they blame the victim too - their skirt was too short, their door was unlocked, they shouldnrsquot have been out at night. \"Nearly all serial killers believe their crimes are justied, or at least explainable,\" Douglas says. \"They perceive themselves as the true victims - yet another manestation of their extreme narcissism\".The truth is, says Douglas, these men made a choice to kill. Whether they had a dreadful childhood or not - and many did suffer appalling physical, emotional and sexual abuse - they knew the dference between right and wrong. They were not pre-programmed to kill. The acted of their own freewill. They want to lsquoplay Godrsquo, as Douglas puts it. \"The reality is that a bad background is not an excuse for murder.\"Self-evidently, confronting such horror has its cost. \"As an investigator of violent crime, you try to be as emotionally detached as possible, not only to maintain your objectivity and critical judgement, but also to preserve your sanity,\" he says. \"In fact, having to put myself, as a behavioural profiler, into the head of every victim whose case I work has definitely taken its psychic toll on me throughout my career.\"* The Killer Across the Table: Unlocking the Secrets of Serial Killers and Predators with the FBIrsquos Original Mindhunter by John E Douglas and Mark Olshaker is published by William Collins on May  priced pound in hardback.THE KILLERS ACROSS THE TABLEJOHN Douglas has spent time in the company of some of the most infamous offenders in criminal history. They include:David Berkowitz aka the Son of Sam. Berkowitz went on a murder spree in the New York during the summer of  killing six people. He sent letters to the police signed Mr Monster and when caught claimed a demon inside a dog belonging to his neighbour lsquoSamrsquo instructed him to kill. He remains behind bars.Ted Bundy. The seemingly charming, highly intelligent and attractive Bundy brought terror to America in the s. He was finally caught after two escapes from custody and confessed to  murders. He died in the electric chair in  with crowds outside chanting lsquoBurn, Bundy, Burnrsquo.Richard Speck. He tortured, raped and murdered eight student nurses in . He was condemned to die but the death sentence was overturned. He died in prison after serving  years.Gary Ridgway aka the Green River Killer. Convicted of  murders, hersquos the most prolic serial killer in America. His victims were mostly sex workers and runaways. He was spared the death penalty but will die in prison.JOHN DOUGLAS ON FILM AND TVSCOTT Glen famously portrayed a version of John Douglas in The Silence of the Lambs, but itrsquos the Netflix series Mindhunter which has really brought the detail of his work to le for millions.In Mindhunter, the lead character Holden Ford is based on Douglasrsquo early career with the FBIrsquos Behavioural Science Unit. Douglas along with his colleague Robert Ressler - the man who coined the term serial killer - began travelling the country interviewing serial offenders in prison to gain insight into how they think in the hope of using the information to catch offenders still at large.Their work would have been impossible without Dr Ann Burgess who was studying ways to help women who had been raped. Her work looking at crime from the victimrsquos perspective helped develop a  degree view of serial crime. The three eventually published the Crime Classication Manual, which remains a handbook for detectives today.Douglas has also been played by Hugh Dancy as special investigator Will Graham in the series Hannibal, which charts the le of the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter.Douglas is now retired from the FBI but continues to consult on major crime. He worked on the Amanda Knox case, and supported her claim of innocence, and also helped free a number of men wrongfully convicted of three child murders spuriously connected to Satanism."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9774751.jpg?type=article-full","title":"interview-scotland-secretary-david-mundell-on-independence-brexit-and-david-cameron","story":"David Cameronrsquos coalition beefed up Holyroodrsquos tax-ying abilities after implementing the recommendations of the Calman commission.A majority Conservative Government then accepted the post-indyref Smith Commission findings which gave the Parliament new tax and social security powers.The Tory politician who was involved with both sets of reforms was David Mundell, who in a twenty-year career in politics has served at Holyrood and Westminster.He was a junior Minister in the Scotland Office for the Calman legislation, and was Cameronrsquos Secretary of State of Scotland when the Smith proposals were turned into law. He has been in the same post for nearly four years and is in Prime Minister Theresa Mays Cabinet.: SNP members support new currency as soon as practicableSitting in his office in the west end of Edinburgh - two pillows nestle on the sofa, one with a saltire and the other emblazoned with a Union Jack - the MP for Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale  Tweeddale is keen to mention his role in post-devolution politics.However, achievements of the past cannot mask problems of the present. Mundell is at the centre of two constitutional storms that show little sign of settling down.We met twenty four hours after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans for another independence referendum, a policy he vigorously opposes.He is also the Scottish Tory face of Mayrsquos troubled Brexit deal, which has been rejected by MPs on three occasions. Brexit has been delayed and voters will have the opportunity to vote in the European elections next month. The Tories are expecting a drubbing.ldquoItrsquos inevitable now, Mundell says of the elections, wearily. ldquoWersquove run out of time. The reason we are having it is one of the reasons I think many people voted to leave the EU, in the sense that lsquorules are rulesrsquo.Askedhe expected the election would be dficult for his party, he replies: ldquoAll the evidence would suggest that it is going to be a challenge, but wersquove had challenges before.The Governmentrsquos focus is on producing an alternative set of proposals that could command the support of MPs. With Tory right wingers opposed to Mayrsquos deal, the Prime Minister has turned to Labour, who are demanding a customs union.Mundell has previously said the Government would be ldquowilling to discuss such a proposal. However, would he be willing to discuss having a confirmatory vote, which would pit Mayrsquos deal against Remain in another referendum ldquoThe Government doesnrsquot support a confirmatory vote. I donrsquot support a confirmatory vote. Wersquove had two attempts to bring that forward in the House of Commons, he says.ldquoMy personal view is that there is not a majority of MPs in the House of Commons for a confirmatory vote. I donrsquot think there is a logic to it.Mundell campaigned for Remain in  and is known to have a disregard for some of his more bloody-minded Brexiteer colleagues.I have three shots at asking him how he would vote in the event of a second referendum,the choice was between Mayrsquos plan and Remain.ldquoI want to respect the outcome of the referendum wersquove had, so I donrsquot want there to be another referendum, he says. That was a dodge.I press again. Would he back Mayrsquos deal in another referendum  ldquoIrsquom not trying to evade the question. Irsquom clear that her deal is the best deal that is on offer for us to leave the EU. Irsquom clear that we need to respect the outcome of the initial referendum.I ask a dferent version of the same question. Is it possible you could vote Remain ldquoNo, ldquo he says firmly. ldquoI would find it dficult to vote Remain in a future referendum because it would not be respecting the outcome of the previous referendum.Picture of David Mundell by Gordon TerrisI read him recent comments by Scottish Tory MP Stephen Kerr, who said that Tory hardliners displayed the same sort of ldquoromanticised and ldquosometimes xenophobic attitudes as some Scottish nationalists.Mundell appears to concur with his colleaguersquos assessment. ldquoThere are a group of Conservative colleagues whose entire political approach is driven by Brexit, he says.ldquoThey are as obsessive about Brexit as Nicola Sturgeon and some of her colleagues are about independence. Brexit matters to them more than any of the circumstances around it, or other things that are happening.Paul Hutcheon: Nicola Sturgeons route to indyref is through Jeremy CorbynGeorge Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, was revealed recently to have argued against holding an EU referendum before it became Government policy.I ask Mundell, who has always had a pragmatic view on the EU,he was also privately sceptical at that time.ldquoI felt that we had committed to doing it and I felt there wasnrsquot any way of not doing it, having committed to doing it, he says, cryptically.Mundell believes the problem was in the EU reform package Cameron negotiated with European partners ahead of the referendum.If the EU had given more ground, particularly on freedom of movement, Mundell believes this could have shted the dial.ldquoIf David Cameron had been able to secure a dferent package, a better package...that might have ended up dferently.Mundell was an early supporter of Cameron. He backed his leadership bid in  and warmed to his social liberalism. However, Cameronrsquos stock has plummeted after becoming the unwitting architect of a policy - Brexit - he never wanted.He says he has ldquono regrets about voting for Cameron, but concedes the former Prime Minister may have a problem with his legacy.ldquoAs at this moment, he is defined by that referendum and the result, he says.ldquoIn ten years time, we will be able to make that judgement, as to whether that is entirely the dominant feature, in the way that the Iraq war has become Tony Blairrsquos legacy.ldquoWhether we see David Cameron solely in that context or not, I donrsquot know. I hope not.Tory MSPs are becoming increasingly restless about the Brexit farce. Their party made impressive gains at the last general election and are focused on trying to win the Holyrood poll in . Does Mundell believe Brexit is harming Ruth Davidsonrsquos chances of becoming First Minister ldquoI donrsquot think it is, because Ruth will very clearly in the  election set out to people what the clear choice in that election is, which is Nicola Sturgeon continuing as First Minister, independence and a threat of a referendum never going away, compared to Ruthrsquos offer, he says.Mundell is also taking an interest in who will succeed May, given that she wonrsquot contest the next general election:He wants the next Tory leader to have a strong commitment to the Union and be socially liberal: ldquoI want somebody who has a modern outlook and who is in touch with modern le, and how people live their lives.Boris Johnson, who has caused major problems for May, will not be his choice. Mundell has already ruled out serving in a Johnson Cabinet and aims a few more darts in his direction:ldquoI donrsquot think that he is someone who does particularly gel in Scotland.Mundell says Johnson has not had many dealings with Scotland, other than an ldquoill-fated tilt at becoming Edinburgh Universityrsquos rector:ldquoHe has not dipped his toe signicantly into the Scottish political scene. He is not necessarily somebody who has an obvious affinity with Scotland.Mundellrsquos analysis on the attributes of the next leader may be persuasive, but his comments on social liberalism niggle.In the very early days of the Scottish Parliament, when Mundell was a Tory MSP, his party launched a nasty campaign opposing the repeal of anti-gay legislation relating to schools.: SNP councillor snubbed as candidate after being quizzed on Salmond-Sturgeon rtMundell, who later came out as gay, voted against the repeal of what was then called Section . Does he regret how he voted ldquoIt was a point in time. To me, now, it does very much look like history, the way in which that unfolded, he says.Can he see why the LGBT community would be bitter about this episode ldquoI can understand why people can turn their focus backward, but I think itrsquos better to think of actually what has been achieved in that period. What has been achieved in that period of twenty years has [been] a wholesale change in attitude, here in Scotland and across the UK, he replies.Back to the day job, his Cabinet colleague David Liddington last week ruled out a second independence referendum - by way of sanctioning a Section  order - before .Mundell goes further. Askedhe could ever imagine a Tory Government agreeing a section  order, he says:ldquoNo, I canrsquot envisage that circumstance.He then softens slightly: ldquoWersquove had a referendum. It was to be a once-in-a-generation event. Now we could have a debate about how long a generation is, but not in the forseeable future.His view is a minority Labour Government, led by Corbyn, is the biggest threat to the Union.ldquoCorbyn is Nicolarsquos route to a referendum. Itrsquos the only route to a referendum.Mundell, as the longest-serving Scottish Secretary since Ian Lang in the s, is a canny political operator who has helped add to the powers of the Parliament.

In homes across the land, black and white television sets flickered with images of Patrick Troughton as Dr Who and for the lucky few with a colour set, there was the first chance to see Coronation Street ndash and Elsie Tannerrsquos red hair - in glorious colour.The box in the corner was already sucking up more and more of our time. And for those with a thirst for knowledge, for whom university had seemed like something for other people from posher homes to do, it was about to become a passport to a whole new world.Of course for many, the Open University - which this week marked  years since it was handed its charter to help distance learners achieve their dreams - will always be associated with late night BBC programmes presented by hirsute, softly-spoken chaps who looked like they spent evenings in a bedsit listening to Yes, pondering Cantors Theorem over a bottle of brown ale.But for more than two million students, including those who diligently set video recorders, stayed up late or rose early to catch a man in corduroy explaining Einstein and the Laws of Nature using a cardboard train and a clock, it was le-changing.Founded in  by Harold Wilsons Labour government and driven forward by Fe-born Minister for the Arts, Jenny Lee, the so-called lsquoUniversity of the Airrsquo may have been frowned upon by the establishment at birth, but today is playing a key role in educating the nation, helping to fill skills gaps and delivering to Scotlandrsquos employers ndash from the NHS to Fintech start-ups - university-level students with real le and work skills.And, of course, at  years old with modern digital technology at its fingertips, todayrsquos long-distance OU lectures are a much more modern learning experience.ldquoIt has changed a lot of peoplersquos lives who would not have had the chance in the first place, either because of economic circumstances, because they didnrsquot have the chance at school or didnrsquot just didnrsquot really like school, says Marie Hendry, Depute Director for External Engagement and Partnership for the OU in Scotland. ldquoIt has helped peoplersquos lives have changed for the better.Those old grainy black and white programmes and handful of courses long ago have now given way to highly-sophisticated digital-based distance learning. There are now over  modules offered by OU in Scotland,  associate lecturers, and online lectures which make use of foreign-language chatbots, virtual reality and articial intelligence.Since the first OU courses became available, there have been , OU qualications awarded to students in Scotland.Far from a lsquosecond chance universityrsquo for the middle-aged seeking the degree they always craved, it now attracts an increasing number of younger students ndash the median age for an OU student in Scotland is now just .Among its learners are sixth-year pupils at school ndash some in rural locations with limited access to modern languages or science teachers ndash graduate apprentices, and NHS workers looking to boost their career prospects.An increasing number of students are choosing OU over bricks and mortar rivals ndash drawn by the chance to earn and learn ndash some looking to reskill to change career, while at the other end of the scale are students in their nineties.Three-quarters of Scottish students combine studies with work, many also juggle family and carersrsquo obligations, or debilitating health problems. And the majority are ploughing through STEM subjects ndash particularly welcome for employers fearing a skills gap ndash with % of Scottish students following a STEM-related course, % of them women.ldquoThere is no typical OU student, adds Hendry. ldquoEveryone is dferent. People donrsquot come to our university. We take it to them.While debate often rages over how lsquobricks and mortarrsquo universities can shed their elitist gown and become more open to students from less wealthy backgrounds and inclusive, Hendry points out that % of OU in Scotland students come from the countryrsquos most deprived areas, and % declare a disability - % of which are mental health related.In Logan close to Cumnock, mother of three Leeanne MacPherson, , is managing her BAMental Health Nursing degree alongside night shts, school runs and day to day le. ldquoYou donrsquot even want to see the ironing, she laughs.But the opportunity to study for her nursing degree while continuing to work as a nursing assistant an NHS Ayrshire and Arran mental health unit for the elderly in East Ayrshire has, she says, been le-changing. ldquoItrsquos been the best opportunity I have ever had, she says.Collaborative working between OU in Scotland, the Scottish Government and NHS boards has opened the door to nursing staff like her wanting to advance their qualications without stopping work ndash meaning they can continue to fill vital health roles as they train.For Leeanne, itrsquos a chance to gain the nursing qualication she once thought may have passed her by after leaving school, working in a jeans factory and then combining raising her family with working in childcare and then in mental health.ldquoI do feel guilty sometimes when Irsquom sitting with the laptop and the kids are saying theyrsquore bored and want to do something, she admits. ldquoThere can be sacrices, but itrsquos four years to get me where I want to be. ldquoIn Inverness, Karis Williamson, who has congenital muscular dystrophy, also says the OU has been le-changing. ldquoIt has given me some self-respect, and re-educated me about what education really is and who I really am and what Im capable of, she says.Karis, who features as part of a new photography collection taken by renowned British photographer Chris Floyd, to mark the OUrsquos th Anniversary, began studying with OU aged , mostly ploughing her way through Arts modules.She is now studying for a BA Open Degree, which allows students to choose their own subjects to build a bespoke qualication. Support through the university and the Disabled Studentsrsquo Allowancehas given her access to invaluable equipment, including an eye-gaze computer and special software.Most of her studying is done at home in Inverness, where her garden shed has been turned into a lsquoBook Templersquo. ldquoDue to my illness I can never take tomorrow for granted, she says. ldquoI wanted to squash in as much as possible while I can.Perhaps once considered a lesser option than a traditional degree, Hendry - who is herself studying for an OU MBA - believes employers are increasingly recognising the quality of an OU graduate.ldquoThey say time and again that the people who graduate have effective time management skills and that tenacity to be able to study at the same time as manage careers and family and other responsibilities. Theyrsquore adaptable, flexible and creative thinkers.It makes for an emotional graduation ceremony, she adds.ldquoThere are people who are recovering from cancer, or whose parents have died while they were studying, they might have health issues or worked hard around a family.ldquoThere are tears. They are often crying, and we are often crying with them.ldquoItrsquos lovely.Tie pieceThe Open University has attracted well-known figures keen to improve their knowledge, and had an impact on television viewersrsquo and radio listenersrsquo understanding of culture, nature and science.Sir Lenny Henry, who presented an hour-long BBC documentary Happy Birthday OU:  Years of the Open University, on Thursdayobtained an English Literature BAin .He said: ldquoWithout the OU I would never have dreamt of making all the documentaries I have done in the last  years. Because of the OU, I have been able to engage with these texts in a critical fashion with some academic polish.Other well-known former students include Myleene Klass , Holly Willoughby , Jerry Halland serial killer Myra Hindley .Meanwhile, retired newsreader Anna Fordrsquos first television work was as a social studies tutor for the OU from -. And Robin Wilson, the son of Prime Minister Harold Wilson who was a major driving force behind its creation, went on to be an OU maths professor.The OU also gave some famous names their first television break ndash David Tennant and Daniel Craig were in OU televised dramas. David Prowse ndash the actor who filled the imposing shoes of Darth Vader in Star Wars ndash also appeared in the OUrsquos version of Jean Genetrsquos The Balcony.Each year the OU co-produces approximately  prime-time TV and radio series. They have included some of the UKrsquos best-loved programmes including Coast, James Mayrsquos Big Ideas, Bang Goes the Theory and Blue Planet II.Radio commissions have included Economics with Subtitles, BBC Inside Science and The Bottom Line.The OU has also played a role in fiction. The Archers, Brookside, Ever Decreasing Circles, Birds of a Feather and Goodnight Sweetheart have all had OU students written into their plots, while actress Julie Waltersrsquo big film break came when she portrayed an OU student opposite Michael Caine in Educating Rita.Minister for further and higher education, Richard Lochhead, said: ldquoAs one of the worldrsquos first successful distance teaching universities, the Open University was founded on the belief that communications technology could bring high quality degree-level learning to people who had not had the opportunity to attend traditional campus universities. More than  million people from over  countries have benefited from their courses.ldquoI congratulate the Open University on its th anniversary and commend it for its long tradition of widening access to higher education for learners from non-traditional backgrounds, and for its approach to flexible learning, giving every student the opportunity to learn in a way that benefits them."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9774673.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kelvingrove-animals-are-deep-frozen-to-eliminate-moths","story":"This alarming process is happening right now in a wardrobe near you ndash and disturbingly, Tineola bisselliellaseems to be growing ever more rampant. According to The Heraldrsquos fashion editor Eva Arrighi, the pests ndash which appear partial to fine silk, angora and cashmere ndash are creating intense fear and loathing within the rag trade. Former Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman famously declared war on the tiny creatures ndash they are only half-an-inch across ndash after her designer wardrobe was attacked and Arrighi now fears for her own vintage coat collection after discovering that the blighters had been silently chomping through the carpets beneath her household furniture.Insecticide sales are soaring and itrsquos not only domestic properties that are at risk. Earlier this month it was reported that carpets in the High Court of Glasgow had been treated for moth infestation.Meanwhile, stately homes are on high alert. At Newhailes house, Musselburgh, the biggest moth control programme ever mounted by the National Trust for Scotlandis under way after a sharp increase in insect activity was detected there. As NTS preventive conservator Mel Houston explains, the exercise is designed to nip the problem in the bud before the moth population explodes.: Hundreds of climate change activists pretend to die in Glasgow museumShe attributes the insectsrsquo UK-wide expansion to central heating, the popularity of luxury fabrics and perhaps lower housekeeping standards than our forebears, and the Newhailes anti-moth programme includes lots of ldquovery unglamorous cleaning, cleaning and more cleaning. ldquoMoths donrsquot like being disturbed, explains Houston, ldquoandyou keep hoovering, you hoover up the eggs and larvae and reduce the population.The NTS has also created a mini-ice age within the th-century country house by installing two huge freezers cold enough to kill adult insects, larvae and eggs. Priceless historic carpets, curtains and even sofas are being systematically removed from their settings, wrapped and then chilled to minus-C before being ed to the deep-cleaned rooms, which will then be carefully monitored to guard against re-infestation.Glasgow Museums, which owns textiles and costumes dating back to the year , also adopts the freezer method: the Burrellrsquos entire tapestry collection has been put through the servicersquos own industrial-sized chiller as a precaution. And as preventive conservator David Thomson points out, this isnrsquot a new technique. ldquoIn the old days, anyone with fur coats would take them to the furrier to be kept in cold storage during the warm summer months.Clothes moths have been around for a long time ndash though no-one seems sure whether they are native to these shores or were imported from warmer climes, perhaps on the tunic of a Roman soldier or even a Bronze Age warrior. We do know that they are an age-old nuisance. In , Elizabeth I engaged eight men to spend a full day beating Windsor Castlersquos furs to rid them of moths. But in modern times, says Thomson, the problem became considerably more troublesome around  years ago ndash perhaps, he speculates, following the ban on naphthalene-based insecticides such as mothballs.This isnrsquot just a UK problem. In some American museums, where millions of dollars are spent on pest control, people are banned from bringing overcoats into buildings. Could museums of the future institute a polyester clothing rule, I wonder.The recent ldquodramatic increase in moth numbers means Thomson now devotes much of his working le to the threat and, like Houston, he says scrupulous cleaning is crucial.ldquoDust, which is largely skin particles and clothing fibres, accumulates , times faster in a museum context because of the large number of people in our buildings, he points out.ldquoSo we need to make sure our housekeeping is based on good old hoovering, and that display systems donrsquot create dust traps.ldquoWe are refurbishing the Burrell and itrsquos really important that our redisplays of the tapestries are safe from infestation. One of the ways wersquore doing that is trying to ensure our buildings are scrupulously cleanable, and some of the design work for the new Burrell is based around eliminating the possibility of dust traps.: Hundreds of climate change activists pretend to die in Glasgow museumStored objects are regularly checked, quarantined and treated as necessary and as Thomson points out, taxidermy is particularly vulnerable. Moth larvae live on keratin, the protein which makes up skin, hair, nails and feathers. Every so often, says Thomson, one of Kelvingroversquos much-loved stuffed birds or mammals has to be removed from display and placed in the freezer. ldquoThe natural history conservator knows how to look for tell-tale signs, he adds. ldquoMost obviously, they might spot an adult moth exiting from its feathers. That means it has pupated there. If you look closely you can sometimes see the larvae or its faeces, which is called frass.In domestic settings, the signs are similar. ldquoThe most obvious one is flying adult moths, says Thomson. ldquoIf eggs have been laid on your favourite jumper, you wonrsquot see them because they are too small for the human eye butyou notice holes and look closer, you may see caterpillars which have hatched out and increased in size after eating [your jumper]. Theyrsquore white with a brown head.Icky as all this sounds, Thomson freely admits to having moths in his own home ndash which like most old tenements has plenty of the floorboard and skirting gaps that can harbour the insects. In fact, he seems almost grateful for these domestic close encounters, for helping him get to know his professional enemy.Back at Newhailes, Mel Houston says she and her colleagues are deliberately ldquoopen about washing our dirty linen in public, because we are doing the best we can and we know that a lot of our visitors have moth problems themselves. In fact, wersquove been running tours to let people see how we are cleaning, how we are treating the problem and looking after our properties and collections.A keen environmentalist who is also a member of the Bugle conservation trust, Houston is conscious of the apparent irony of targeting the insects at a time when many moth species are under threat. Just last week, Scottish Natural Heritagereported that moth numbers have declined by % over the past  years, with moorland species particularly affected ndash a trend attributed to global warming, and changes in land management and habitats.Clothes moths, however, were not covered in the report and SNH trends and indicators analyst Simon Foster is heartened that the NTS is raising awareness of the many ieties of valuable moths and butterflies. Moths, he says, are ldquomuch maligned because of one or two troublesome species and while he understands the need to control the clothes-munching iety, he points out that overall, moths are ldquoa really important group for pollinating plants and ldquoa key part of Scotlandrsquos natural environment.A glimpse of a flitting Burnet or Cinnabar should convince anyone that these beautul creatures are welcome within our midst. Nor is the clothes moth itself an unlovely specimen, with its delicate wings and fluttering flight pattern. Its offspring, however, are destructive and while banishing them from our homes completely seems unlikely , spring is a good time to try. ldquoIf you can prevent them mating and laying eggs, yoursquove reduced the cycle, says David Thomson.Fashion editor Eva Arrighi is also on the case. Having spent ldquoa fortune on moth-killing treatments, she now conducts nightly patrols of her home, waiting for a winged invader to flit into her path. ldquoMy kids think Irsquove gone mad and Irsquom prone to agree, she says. ldquoBut I think you have to be obsessive to deal with moths.Moth-busting tipsMoths, says Mel Houston, are \"secretive\" beasties, which hide themselves away and only emerge to look for a mate or a suitable woolly birthing place. By the time you see them, theyve already done their worst since its the larvae that munch through your clothes and carpets before emerging as adult moths.To prevent further damage:Hoover frequently, particularly under furniture .Use pheromone traps to monitor moth activity in your home.Wash clothes before storing and ideally place in sealed plastic bags.Our fashion editor Eva Arrighi recommends placing lavender bags or cedar balls in clothes drawers, though she suggests the latter should be sanded to release the aroma.If infestation is suspected, wash garments at the highest temperature the fabric will stand.For woollens and delicates, borrow a tip from our conservation experts by wrapping in plastic bags and placing in your freezer for a week or two to kill moths, eggs and larvae.Chemical moth-killers are effective when used according to manufacturers instructions. For serious infestations, consider engaging the services of a professional pest-control company, which will be licensed to use fumigation techniques."},{"url":null,"title":"ready-steady-fundraise-the-london-marathon-revolution","story":"Last year it hauled in a whopping pound. million and that record is set to be blown yet again, with at least a fth more donations pledged for this year.

Dame Barbara Windsor is its unofficial figurehead ndash not only the inspiration for Barbararsquos Revolutionaries, a running team pulled together by her husband, Scott Mitchell, but also for many others across the nation.Behind every pound raised by runners is some sort of personal tale, often involving a loved one lost to a disease, or struggling with a condition. Among these, for instance, is -year-old Kath Murray, who has been inspired to run by the fact that her mother has recently been diagnosed with dementia. She is fundraising not for Dementia Revolution but for its Scottish cousin, Alzheimer Scotland.Murray is one of the % of the UK applications for this yearrsquos run who have never run a marathon before. Before she signed up for this yearrsquos event, she considered, she says, she ldquocould not run. ldquoI was not a runner, she recalls, ldquoIn my school days, I remember, I used to duck out of the running activities. I used to say, lsquoI canrsquot run.rsquo It baffled my teachers. A year ago I was interested to join a Jog Scotland group, and went to their running sessions for a few weeks, but I didnrsquot really stick at it.ldquoI just got a bee in my bonnet,\" she says, \"about trying to give the London Marathon a go this year. I felt more driven because of what happened with my mum. Irsquom not naturally a runner, so itrsquos been a bit of a mad thing for me to sign up to do this. With Alzheimer Scotland providing support to my family I decided obviously I should apply to get one of their spaces.Her mother, who is , was recently diagnosed as having early onset dementia. Murray says that her mum is ldquoin denial about her condition. Though they talk about her running and the fact that she is fundraising for Alzheimer Scotland, she is not aware that her daughter doing it ldquofor her. ldquoA couple of times Irsquove been down to visit her, she says, ldquoand had to do my training run while Irsquom there, but we donrsquot talk about it as relating to her. My mum is keeping the two things separate. Shersquos not really clocked that itrsquos all about her ndash and Irsquove not made a point of pointing it out to her. She just thinks Irsquom a bit mad.During training she used the -week plan advised in the book, The Non Runnerrsquos Marathon Trainer. ldquoOnce Alzheimer Scotland offered me the place, she says, ldquowhich was last October, I realised Irsquoll need to start getting myself in gear ndash so I signed up and did a K Santa run at the start of December. That was really my very first training runyou like. For me it was a real struggle. I was pretty much the last in the group of people to finish. To begin with I had to do quite a bit of walking in between running. Itrsquos been quite scary looking back the miles that Irsquove done since starting back in January to doing short three mile training runs to recently my longest runs at  miles.Of the thousands of runners who take to the route ndash there were over , last year ndash many are Scots. The causes they run for are wide-ranging. Some, like -year-old Gillian McDonald, who is raising money for the Fragile X Society, are running for small charities with relatively tiny profiles ndash causes that struggle to stand out from the rest of the pack. McDonald observes: ldquoYou go to these events and there are charities which have hundreds and hundreds of runners, running for them. And I felt I was like there on my own. Itrsquos something you feel is a bit unfair that they get all these charity places and there are other charities that are desperate for the profile and the funds.Steven Henderson, Aberdeen, Running for Scottish Huntingtonrsquos Association\"Itrsquos my third London Marathon in a row. I did my first in . Huntingtonrsquos disease has been in my family for a while. Itrsquos hereditary and has gone back through my grandfatherrsquos side of the family. It has affected my mother, my sister. Irsquove not actually been tested for it ndash so I donrsquot knowI have got it or not. Irsquove got a : chance. I decided I didnrsquot want to be tested for it yet.My mum started to get symptoms when she was in her thirties. Shersquos just coming up for sixty and itrsquos now got quite a hold. It has affected her mobility, her speech. One of the most noticeable things is the fact that my mum fidgets quite a lot. Overall it takes away the ability to do anything ndash her speech, her hearing, her memory, her walking. If you knew my mum ten years ago, you would hardly recognise her from then.Itrsquos something thatrsquos very close to me, soit were possible to find a cure, or anything to help, all the better.I actually took up running for a bit of a laugh when an older family member said that I was putting on a bit of weight. One of my friends I played football with ran the marathon in , and I thought, Maybe Irsquoll give it a go. I got in touch with Huntingtonrsquos thinking I could do it for them.I was never a runner, by any shape or form. But Ive taken to it and I enjoy it now. It takes my mind off things like work. Irsquom a coordinator for an oil and gas services company and the job itself is quite stressful. Running is something I look forward to doing. It takes my mind off work and helps me cope. Doing the marathon itself gives me a sense of pride that through the money I generate and collect Irsquove been able to contribute towards something rather than just hoping that some progress will happen in finding a cure for Huntingtonrsquos.\"Andy Cunningham, Dundee, Running for Maggiersquos Centres\"When I ran the London marathon for Maggiersquos Centres in , it was my first ever run in anything. I was never a runner before. I was a swimmer when I was growing up and could swim for hours, but the minute it was running, I was done.My mum had breast cancer when I was growing up and more recently she has been diagnosed with leukaemia. When I chose Maggiersquos Centre in  she didnrsquot have cancer. I chose it because Irsquom a teacher and I was doing my masters in pupil care and support. I chose to research into how schools can support pupils whose parents have cancer. I heard about Maggiersquos and got familiar with what they do and it inspired me. I like the way they help people deal with cancer, whether emotionally or by providing that space for people to understand whatrsquos going on with their lives.After the first marathon, I felt the atmosphere was just so amazing that I knew I would want to do it again. This year I decided to apply to Maggiersquos Centres again. I came up with this fund-raising idea of doing something with the mini penguins that Maggiersquos had produced following their Penguin Parade public art thing they did in Dundee last year. My we, a childrenrsquos author, Pamela Butchart, has lots of friends that are quite big childrenrsquos illustrators and it all kind of came into place, and we got some of them to paint them, so we could raffle them offBetween my first marathon and now, wersquove had a wee baby, who is now  months. First time round there was no baby and I was in the routine of following a fitness plan and got into it. This time round itrsquos been more dficult to find the time to do it with the baby ndash but itrsquos also been easier because I kind of know what I need to be doing distance-wise.\"Gillian McDonald, Peebles, Running for Fragile X SocietyldquoIrsquove got twin boys called Stuart and Matthew, who will be  this year. They were diagnosed with Fragile X when they were about ten years old. There are things that they find really challenging ndash like reading and writing ndash and theyrsquore quite excitable, so they do a lot of hand-clapping. I hadnrsquot heard of Fragile X till I saw something about it on the news about ten years ago. It ticked so many boxes that I then asked for the boys to be tested for it which can only be done through a blood test. There is no cure ndash so itrsquos really just coping mechanisms.As soon as we got the diagnosis of Fragile X we turned to the society ndash and my husband has since been its chair. Last year the society managed to win one place for the London marathon in the charity ballot and they then put it out to tender to the rest of the society. I had done some research and saw most charities are looking for a couple of thousand pounds, so I said I would try to raise pound. In the end I raised over pound, by doing lots of dferent events.All my focus was on the fundraising, and the running of the marathon was just something that had to happen at the end. My sons came down and they dyed their hair blue which is the colour of the society.This time I applied to the general ballot and when I got a place it was a bit of a no-brainer that I would run for the society again.Fragile X is the most common inherited learning disorder, but itrsquos quite surprising how many people havenrsquot heard of it ndash whereas everybody has heard of autism. There could be quite a lot of people who are being thought of as autistic, who could potentially have Fragile X, but theyrsquove not had the blood test.Shane Jamieson, Southampton, Running for Chest Heart And Stroke ScotlandldquoMy family have supported Chest Heart And Stroke Scotland for the past few years, following the passing of my grandfather, Harry. We ran the Berlin half marathon as a family, and I just thought Irsquod like to take up the challenge of a marathon.Irsquom originally from Shetland and my grandfather, who owned a shop there, was always quite full of le. A few years ago he went in for an operation in Aberdeen and unfortunately during his recovery had a stroke and passed away from that. The support we received from CHSS is the reason why wersquore raising for them. My grandfather was just over  and had this kind of attitude that he was probably going to live for ever. It came as quite a shock when he passed.Obviously everyone has their own story of why they do the marathon. For me, the charitable cause is the reason you get out of bed ndash because yoursquore doing it for a reason and a good cause. But at the runs themselves you are looking just to get through and put one foot in front of the other."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-labour-mp-corbyn-brexit-leaflet-is-bulls","story":"Leaked WhatsApp messages show Paul Sweeney describing the leaflet as ldquobull****, while colleagues Ged Killen and Martin Whitfield both blasted it as a ldquodisaster.Whitfield added that ldquowe need a rethink or Labour will be dead in Scotland, while Killen claimed that the ldquoparty is in crisis in Scotland.In the same exchange, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said he was getting dozens of emails from constituents saying they are no longer voting Labour.Paul Hutcheon: Nicola Sturgeons route to indyref is through Jeremy CorbynCorbyn and his allies support a soft version of Brexit, but many of the partyrsquos MPs and members are staunchly pro-Remain and want to stay in the European Union by way of another referendum.Opposition to Corbynrsquos stance is evident in Scotland, where over % of voters backed Remain in .

In the meantime, I think sterlingisation will start to unravel as a policy as soon as it is put under public scrutiny.Pamela Nash, chief executive of the pro-UK Scotland in Union campaign group, said: ldquoThe SNP has voted to fast-track its plan to scrap the pound and put salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk.ldquoIn a huge challenge to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos authority, members have snubbed her proposal and voted to complete this reckless act even sooner than she wanted.Jackson Carlaw, interim leader of the Scottish Tories, said: ldquoThis is a profoundly embarrassing snub for the SNP leadership. And it shows that Nicola Sturgeon is now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible.ldquoIt only underlines the growing need to stand up against Nicola Sturgeon and say no to a second referendum so we can focus on what matters, not the SNPrsquos deeply dangerous plans to dump the pound.Two polls published last week showed that the public are opposed to the pound being scrapped in favour of a new currency.A Survation poll, commissioned by Scotland in Union, found that % of respondents wanted to continue with the pound. Around % backed a separate currency.Fewer than one in of the , adults polled said they wanted to use the euro instead of the pound.A YouGov poll published by a daily newspaper yesterday also found little support for the plan to gradually introduce a new currency after independence.The survey found that % of those polled backed the proposal, while % were in favour of the euro. Only % of voters expressed a preference for a new currency straight after independence.However, other poll data by the same company was more encouraging for supporters of independence with % of respondents backing independence, up from % in YouGovrsquos last poll for the same newspaper in June.Meanwhile, Sturgeon will use her keynote speech tomorrow to attack the Conservatives for opposing indyref.She is expected to say: ldquoThe UK Government says it will block Scotlandrsquos right to choose.ldquoA right to choose mandated in not just one but two Scottish elections. And endorsed by the Scottish Parliament.She will also say: ldquoOn Thursday, they tried to justy their position by saying there was no upsurge in support for independence. Two days later the latest opinion poll was already proving them wrong. It shows support for independence already up.Sturgeon will also announce plans that could see greater regulation of short-term let firms such as Airbnb: ldquoWe are asking for views on a new system of regulation to make short term lets subject to the same controls as any other accommodation.ldquoWe want to give councils the power to control the number of lets and ensure they make a contribution to the services they use."},{"url":null,"title":"lyons-and-daniels-inside-a-very-scottish-gang-feud","story":"But a barely-suppressed chuckle went round the High Court when the first target of the latest explosion of violence, Robert Daniel, was asked whether there was any ill feeling between the two families. ldquoNot that I know of, he replied, straight faced.His car had been rammed by another in December , he was then chased into a house in Robroyston in the city, before being twice struck on the back of the head with a hatchet or machete.A month later Thomas Bilsland suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgows Cranhill.Three more were to follow, including the most savage on Steven \"Bonzo\" Daniel. Like the other victims, his car had been secretly fitted with a tracker and in May , after a high-speed car chase which started in the Milton in north Glasgow and ended in an off-ramp of the M, a relentless attack followed, as he was set upon with knives and machete, which almost severed his nose from his face and detached his top jaw from his skull. Ambulance responders at first thought he had been shot.:Six members of Glasgow Lyons crime mob jailed for murder plot against rival Daniel clanIn the trial of the six, \"Bonzo\" denied that the Daniels were a serious crime family, at war with the Lyons, claiming that he didnrsquot knowthey had any enemiesThe Lyons six were last week convicted in what the High Court was told was a conspiracy of murderous intent. They will be sentenced next month.The most senior was Robert \"Piggy\" Pickett, a graduate of the Paisley crime scene, who has been shot, served a sentence for attempted murder, another for contempt and who, again, has a blank memory when it came to anyone who might harbour a drudge against him.Players in this violent arena often have nicknames which belie their lethal nature ndash like \"Gerbil\", \"Goofy\" ndash and in this spirit the six might be called The Bonzo Dog Band, after the Seventies pop group. They acted together and they certainly dogged Bonzo. Not that they followed the message of the  album, Letrsquos Make Up and Be Friendly.THE PAISLEY PATTERNSpecky, Goofy, and Piggy might sound astheyrsquore the characters in a Disney cartoon but nothing could be further from the truth. Theyrsquore the nommes de guerres of three of the most violent and dangerous villains who ever picked up a blade or handgun.Stewart \"Specky\" Boydwas the leader of a drug gang in Paisleyrsquos Ferguslie Park in the late s. Robert \"Piggy Pickett was a lieutenant, as was George \"Goofy\" Docherty. Mark Rennie, a -year-old junkie, borrowed pound from Boyd and attempted to turn this over by small-time dealing. He didnt make the repayments which quickly spiralled, so that he was owing hundreds,not thousands, of pounds.In November , Goofy, Piggy and Stewart Gillespie turned up on Renniersquos doorstep. Gillespie handed a gun to Pickett and told him, ldquoShoot the fat b*****. Piggy clicked the trigger of the shotgun but it didnt fire, so Docherty weighed in with a machete.Rennie survived,only for six months. He vandalised the cars of the two Gillespie brothers. On May , , while trying to run away he was shot in the back. The bullet pierced his lung, spleen and then heart. He died instantly. Stewart Gillespie was the gunman.Gillespie was given a -year sentence. He served  years and was later murdered in his home. Piggy and Goofy were jailed for  and seven years for the first attempt on Rennie.On release both Piggy and Goofy joined the Lyons mob. Goofy was killed after he was stabbed and repeatedly run over in a targeted attack for which no one has been convicted. Piggy awaits his sentence.GLASGOWrsquoS RANGE WARIf there is a source of the original enmity between the two crime families, the Lyons and Daniels, rather than greed and control of drug terrain, it dates back to the summer of  when a large stash of Daniels cocaine was stolen from a house in the Milton housing scheme and sold on to the Lyons. Milton was Lyons terrain and they clearly felt that the Daniels, from nearby Possil, were moving into their fiefdom.For years the Lyons had enjoyed not just immunity, but establishment approval and support. In  Eddie Snr, already well known to police, was given disused Chirnsyde School in the Milton for a \"community project\". Three years later, while he was using the place as the headquarters of his crime empire, he was given pound. million in public funding.For almost two decades now the bitter feud between the gangs has seen fatal and non-fatal shootings, knings, vehicle hit and run, firebomb attacks, police corruption, witness intimidation ndash and drugs, shedloads of drugs. It is a fight to the death. Literally.In early December , Lambhill in north Glasgow became the scene of what one witness described as like a clip from a gangster movie. But there were no cameras and the blood was not ketchup or Kensington Gore. On to the forecourt of Applerow Motorswalked the main \"actors\" wearing long black coats. They were two Danielsrsquo hitmen, Raymond Anderson and James McDonald, who liked to call themselves The Untouchables. They were holding handguns.It was over in minutes but when the smoke cleared Lyons -year-old nephew Michael was dead on the ground, his cousin Steven was badly-wounded, as was Robert Pickett, shot three times in the stomach, later losing a kidney.At the subsequent trial of the two men Pickett claimed the wrong people were in the dock. It was suggested he had been paid to say that. Whatever the truth, he was later sentenced to two years for contempt of court over the evidence. Anderson and McDonald received the longest sentences ever passed in a Scottish court,  years.What probably sparked this carnage was the drive-by shooting three weeks earlier, in Auchinairn, Bishopbriggs, of Daniels lieutenant Kevin \"Gerbil\" Carroll and associate Ross Sherlock. It was the second time Gerbil had been hit, the first outside his mothers home in Milton three years earlier.Carroll had a long history with the Lyons. He claimed to have been bullied at school by family members but he also forged a friendships with Jamie Danielrsquos sons Robert and Francis \"Fraggle\" Green. The ldquoGerbilrsquo became a member of the family running a team of thugs who staged \"alien abductions\" of rival dealers, many of whom worked for the Lyons. They were so called because victims, usually found wandering in a state of semi-undress, would claim they could not remember anything afterwards.Carroll was psychotic. And incorrigible. The end, when it came, was a very public one, at the Asda superstore in Robroyston. Theres little doubt that he was set up, indeed a police officer was later jailed for leaking information to the alleged hit man. As he sat in the back seat of a black Audi outside the busy store the child locks were on so he would have been unable to get out.Three masked gunmen approached the car and shot him five times through the windows as the two men in the front seat fled.One of them, however, phoned \"Fraggle\" Green, who arrived before the police, was given the keys to the car, searched Carrolls body and removed his mobile phone, which the police might have found interesting. It was unlucky Friday January , , seven years and one day after Gerbil had been shot outside his mothers house.:Six members of Glasgow Lyons crime mob jailed for murder plot against rival Daniel clanRoss Monaghan, a Lyons associate, was charged with the murder but the case collapsed because of lack of evidence, a regular occurrence in Glasgowrsquos everlasting gang feud.In January , when Monaghan was taking his daughter to primary school in Glasgow when he was shot a wounded by hitman dressed as a woman and pushing a buggy. Two shots hit him in the arm and shoulder as he ran away. He fled to Spain but ed a couple of weeks later to be photographed in a staged set up with senior members of the Lyons, including Eddie Junior.Martyn Fitzsimmons, a convicted gunrunner, was one of two men acquitted of the shooting. His brother Ryan was one of the victims of the Lyons crime rampage which saw the six men go down, attacked apparently in retribution for the Monaghan shooting. He suffered brain damage.The balance of power has shted over the years. For a time the Daniels were on top but since the death of family leader Jamie ndash who, surprisingly died in bed from cancer in July  ndash the balance has shted. The spree of violence against other senior family members involving the Bonzo Dog Band which followed immediately in the wake may have been an attempt to finally triumph. But no one should bet on that."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-greatest-drives-part-2","story":" miles . - daysWhat makes it so special  Quiet roads and the best climate in the country.Whether yoursquore a flesh-and-blood motoring anorak or merely fond of a bimble when the sun has got his hat on, this -mile loop is a joy.Officially the SW Coastal , it takes in stretches of East and South Ayrshire, the bulk of the Dumfries and Galloway coastline and a section from Dumfries to just north of Moffat, but the route is eminently customisable .What the journey lacks in soul-scorching views it makes up for in a low average volume of traffic, so instead of trudging through Glen Torridon nose to tail with the motorhome in front you can start the trip with a birl though the Mennock Pass and a blast across windswept moorland west of Dalmellington before a wondrous descent into Straiton and the verdant lower flanks of South Ayrshire.

You can get a ferry to Skye or the Small Isles or a boat to Inverie on Knoydart and the chance of a beautul lunch at the remotest pub in the UK, the Old Forge.Pit stop: Glenfinnan Dining Car, Arisaig hotelALAN SIMPSONTrotternish Circuit, Skye miles, allow two-three hours with stopsWhat makes it so special  Majestic rock formations, waterfalls and dinosaur footprints.From Portree, head north east up the A where the spellbinding landscape of the Trotternish peninsula will soon make itself known as the Old Man of Storr looms into view alongside the dark waters of Loch Fada and Loch Leathan.Continuing north therersquos photo opportunities aplenty, first at majestic Lealt Falls and then the commanding Kilt Rock and Mealt Falls at Ellishadder. The small township is home to the Staffin Dinosaur Museum which has an internationally acclaimed collection of fossils.This corner for Skye is world-renowned in palaeontology circles. Just off the main road through Staffin, megalosaurus footprints can be seen at An Corran beach, while a bit further up the coast there is a sauropod trackway on a rocky tidal  near Duntulm Castle.At Staffin, you have a choice to make. You can either carry on north up the A and follow the road as it loops past Flodigarry, Duntulm and Kilmuir towards Uig or you can take the minor road that crosses the peninsula to Uig via the Quiraing.The Quiraing, formed by a massive landslip that has created towering clfs, elevated plateaus and pinnacles of rock, is breathtakingly beautul ndash and boasts a starring role in films such as Macbeth, The BFG and King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.If you continue on the A, Flodigarry was the home of th-century heroine, Flora MacDonald, who aided Bonnie Prince Charliersquos escape after his defeat at Culloden. Her grave is at Kilmuir where there is also a memorial to the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.Both routes will bring you into Uig where you can begin the journey south down the A, back towards Portree. A must visit for many visitors is the Fairy Glen which, just outside Uig, is around a mile-and-a-half along a single-track road.The remainder of the drive to Portree offers ied scenery including crofts, farmland and heather-strewn roadsides. Keep an eye out for birds of prey soaring overhead.Pit stop: A hot chocolate at Single Track Art Gallery  Espresso Bar in KilmaluagSUSAN SWARBRICKElectric Brae, AyrshireHalf-a-mile stretch of the A between Drumshrang and Knoweside.What makes it so special  Lovely views and a properly mysterious lsquogravity hillrsquo.Where  can you defy gravity and make your car magically roll uphill  The Electric Brae, or Croy Brae, is a mysterious stretch of road long celebrated by locals and tourists alike ndash even US President Dwight D Eisenhower took his friends along to have a shot at it during a stay at nearby Culzean Castle. It is a thrill to drive along it for children, especiallyyou fill their heads with tales of buried magnets, magical forces at work and even a strange kink in the planetrsquos gravitational field accounting for the weird effect. As usual, the truth is so much more boring, as itrsquos just an optical illusion ndash the west end of the brae, overlooking the railway viaduct, is actually  feet higher than the eastern end, towards Craigencroy Glen. The so-called \"uphill\" slope, in other words, is actually at the bottom of the hill, but the brain is tricked into believing otherwise.Scotlands  greatest drives: Part onePit stop: The parking lane at the side of the road, helpfully installed by the local council to stop cars randomly stopping on the main carriageway as people try out the gravity hill for themselves, is great. The rest of the A, which runs along the South Ayrshire coastline and through the East Ayrshire countryside, is lovely too, with stunning views out to the Isle of Arran and Ailsa Craig.ANN FOTHERINGHAMThe Cairn orsquoMount road miles hellip allow an hour-and-a-half, including stops.What makes it so special  Winding roads, spectacular views, ancient woodland, history, leaping salmon hellip you name it.Yoursquoll know this road from the traffic reports ndash ldquothe snowgates are closed on the Banchory to Fettercairn road ndash andyoursquore heading north to Banchory or Royal Deeside itrsquos a great alternative to the main A.From Edzell ndash make sure you allow time to wander about here before you begin ndash head to Fettercairnand then up into the mountains. The road gets so seriously steep, itrsquos like yoursquore climbing into the sky, and at the top of the Cairn orsquo Mount, the view doesnrsquot disappoint, and a stop to see the giant cairn is essential. On the way down to Banchory, you really feel yoursquore in Deeside, with patches of Caledonian forest just waiting to be explored. Then, as a final treat, stop at the Bridge of Feughbefore arriving in Banchory just in time for an ice cream at the Mackiersquos shop.Pit stops: Fettercairn, and the Clatterin Brig cafeacute just before the climb into the mountains.ANDY CLARKGlasgow to Ullapool miles, around four-and-a-half hoursA journey right up the middle of Scotland that takes in forests, rivers, firths, lochs and mountains.I have a soft spot for the A. Yes, I know, the lorries and caravans on this main artery from the central belt to Inverness slow you down, and the overtaking can be perilous. But when it comes to quickly transporting and transitioning you from one world to another, lowland to highland, the A holds its own. Leaving the city behind in a flash, the M provides magnicent views of Stirling Castle and the Wallace Monument, and by the time you join the A just before Dunblane, the feel of the landscape has already moved on from town to country. As the drive through Perthshire gets greener and the hills start to roll, you glimpse flashes of the mighty Tay. Onwards north towards the Cairngorms, the signs for Killiecrankie remind you that this peaceful landscape was long fought over. North of Aviemore, the approach to Inverness, across the Kessock Bridge with the Beauly Firth on one side and the Moray Firth on the other, is simply stunning, and before you know it yoursquore in heading to the wilder west and the landscape changes again, becoming more rugged and remote as the peaks grow higher. Ullapoolrsquos cheerful harbour, with its colourful houses and wonderful seafood is a most welcome sight, whether yoursquore going on by ferry to Stornoway or staying put.Pit stop: The Druie Cafeacute on the Rothiemurchus Estate, just outside Aviemore, is the perfect lunch spot, serving delicious local produce ndash the estate-reared beef is superb ndash in stunning surroundings.MARIANNE TAYLORGlenrothes to St Andrews miles,  minutesA beautul drive through the Howe of Fe, the rural heartland of this ancient Kingdom, on to its crowning glory.Head northwards from the new town of Glenrothes on the A and within five minutes yoursquore already in rolling countryside. The pretty villages of Kettlebridge, Balmalcolm and Pitlessie ndash subject of one of Scotlandrsquos greatest paintings, Pitlessie Fair by David Allan ndash are surrounded by fertile fields that overflow with soft fruit in summer. The historic county town of Cupar lies ahead, with its handsome architecture and elegant tearooms, and from there itrsquos on to pretty Dairsie, from where you can almost start to smell the sea. Eventually the road follows the River Eden and takes you there, and the approach to St Andrews, past the Old Course, with views over the West Sands towards the ancient spires beyond, always takes your breath away no matter how many times yoursquove done it.Scotlands  greatest drives: Part onePitstop: The picturesque Pitlessie Village Inn offers top-notch nosh in a cosy setting, with lovely views across the Howe of Fe.MARIANNE TAYLORInverness to Thurso miles What makes it so special  It takes you through the barren beauty of Sutherland and Caithness.Get in your car in Inverness and put straight lines from your mind because this beautul, unexpected route is made of jagged edges and steep climbs its like driving along a giant graph. It sticks to the north sea coast most of the way and the highlight is Berriedale - a  per cent gradient down into the village and a  per cent gradient out of it again - theres nowhere  like it in Britain. And then youre in Caithness where the trees cant fight the wind. Bleak can be beautul.Pit stop: The La Mirage restaurant in Helmsdale for chips as big as sailing ships .MARK SMITHGalloway Country Park to Wigtown miles What makes it so special  Its surprisingly quiet, because most people are in all the obvious places like Loch Lomond or the Highlands.Starting on the edge of the park at Dalmellington, there are ious routes you can take through the park, but theyre all worth it, especiallyyou appreciate wildle. Theres the red deer. There are the wild goats. Andyoure lucky, there are the ospreys and the red kite. This route also proves its not about the journey, its about the destination because at the end of the  miles or so is Wigtown, the town with more book shops than any other in Scotland. Fill your boot with books.Pit stop: On the way back, take a dferent route through the park up the A and stop for a late lunch at the House OHill Hotel, where youll get a solid, handsome, locally sourced meal.MARK SMITHSIX GREAT DRIVING SONGSBruce Springsteen: Racing in the Street SPRINGSTEEN has hymned the automobile culture many times, but this song has an emotional power of its own. \"Now some guys they just give up living  And start dying little by little, piece by piece  Some guys come home from work and wash up  And go racing in the street.\"Chuck Berry: Route  EQUALLY, we could have chosen the  version by the Rolling Stones.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"strong demand at thainstone sale","story":"Over , buyers and sellers attended Thainstone#s collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment on Saturday, April .The sale saw an outstanding , lots forward, and the auction team sold  per cent of all items entered both on-site and online.Commenting Mark Barrack, Head of Specialist Auctions at ANM Group, said: “A strong crowd of buyers was present last week at our April collective auction, which saw consistent prices achieved for good quality lots across all categories.“The day’s leading prices came from two JCB CX excavators which were purchased using our online bidding  and sold to a buyer in England.

The council say that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling the local authority to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon. This, OIC believes, will provide a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council hopes that developments will allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a Needs Case for a new interconnector for Orkney, thereby substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney, including future development of the marine energy sector.OIC believes that the wider economic development value of a new cable to Orkney could be highly signicant, particularlya substantial proportion of local ownership can be secured — which could help employment and income remain in the county.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The proximity of the project at Quanterness to Kirkwall could also enable a separate private wire network project in which the council could directly supply electricity to its own buildings as a means to reduce costs.Public engagement events have been organised for Kirkwall, Eday and Rendall over the coming fortnight. Proposed plans for the developments will be on display at these, with elected members and council officers on hand to discuss the plans with members of the public. The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six m blade tip height turbines. The site on Faray has enough space for up to eight m blade tip height turbinesThe event details are as follows:An event will also be held in Westray, with the date yet to be confirmed.The current proposal at the third site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines, compared to the  presented in the original plans.The proposals for each site are expected to evolve as further site investigation work and consultation is undertaken. Site investigations, including bird and telecommunications studies, will be ongoing at all three sites.The council#s intention is to reach planning permission stage by the end of , ensuring all views and issues are fully explored and considered before any final decisions are made.  Proposals for how the applications will be determined are currently being considered.Councillor James Stockan, Orkney Islands Council leader said: “It is vital that the Council now takes an active ‘developer approach’ to energy projects in our islands. Not only does this allow us to maximise the resources available to us in the islands to support services and projects for local people, but it also allows us to contribute signicantly and in a meaningful way to allow our world-renowned local energy industry to survive and thrive through a new grid connection.“Our strategy is one that meets uncertainty head-on. The final details of proposals are by no means set in stone whilst investigations are carried out at the three sites, nor are all three sites guaranteed planning permission — and of course we also wish to take into account public opinion on the developments. Widening the net and moving to investigate three separate sites, allows us a degree of flexibility in the make-up of the final outcome.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Or the crisis in our hospitals. Or the crisis on our railways.: Poll: Only  in  Scots want  indyref voteFor the SNP, it is independence first, second and always.No matter how loud the applause in the Edinburgh International Conference Centre is this weekend, Nationalist politicians would do well to understand that their own priorities are at odds with the people of Scotland.: MSPs say concerns raised about changes to gender act are ‘misleading’We know this from the latest opinion polling published this week.Voters were asked to rank issues in order of which they thought should be the most important for the Scottish Government to prioritise.The NHS was ranked in the top three by  per cent of respondents, with the cost of living on  per cent, the economy on  per cent, and education on  per cent.Constitutional affairs and independence scored just nine per cent.I suspect you would get a very dferent resultyou surveyed SNP delegates at the EICC, which just shows how out of touch with reality the SNP has become.While they talk among themselves, the message from the public is clear: get on with the day job.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by The First Minister could start by fixing the mess her Government has made of our once-envied education system.It emerged this week that some schools are having to teach pupils studying for National , National  and Higher qualications in the same class.An obsession with the constitution means a generation of children is being let down by this Government.Amid this crisis, the idea that we should spend the next two years having yet another debate about independence is the height of irresponsibility.But that is precisely what Nicola Sturgeon wants to do. She wants to ide the country once again and hold an unwanted second independence referendum before .How do we know it’s unwanted  Because the people of Scotland have said so.Only one-in-five voters support the SNP’s reckless plan to hold another contest before the next Holyrood election.People remember the ision and the toxic atmosphere from  and they don’t want to go through that again any time soon.And they certainly don’t want to go through it while the country is still ided over Brexit.Whatever your views on Brexit, we can all agree that it has revealed just how dficult and complex it is to leave a political union.The UK has only been in the EU for four decades, and it is a much looser partnership of countries than the United Kingdom is.: Nicola Sturgeon ‘facing rebellion’ over post-independence currency plansJust imagine how dficult it would be to tear Scotland out of a centuries-old union in which we are considerably more entwined.It’s little wonder that so many people who voted ‘Yes’ in  have changed their minds. According to this week’s poll, a third would now vote to remain in the UK.Despite campaigning every day since September , the SNP has managed to turn more people off independence. Support for leaving the UK now stands at just  per cent.Most Scots know that we are stronger together and want to build a successful economic future based on our shared culture, history and institutions. Institutions such as our currency – the pound.Today, the SNP will vote to scrap the pound and adopt a new currency in an independent Scotland, putting salaries, mortgages and pensions at risk. According to the polling figures published today, that is supported by just  per cent of voters – while  per cent want to keep the pound.By remaining in the UK, we can keep our pound, grow our economy – without extra red tape for businesses – and use a stable currency backed by the strength of the UK’s central bank and its  million taxpayers.But, instead, today’s conference debate will focus on when to inflict economic harm on communities: immediately in the short-term or after a few years.And it will be coupled with the SNP’s growth commission blueprint which confirms breaking up the UK would lead to even deeper austerity.This isn’t the future most people want for Scotland. It’s not a choice we should have to make.We don’t want another independence referendum.We don’t want to create further ision and have a debate about whether to erect barriers between our friends, families and neighbours in the rest of the UK.But I know the SNP will never drop its narrow nationalist agenda. It will never stop campaigning for separation.So that is why those of us who believe in solidarity must continue to campaign as well. We speak for the majority of Scots who want a Government focused on building a better future for the people of Scotland as part of the UK.We must continue campaigning so that Nicola Sturgeon stops listening only to Nationalists and starts listening to the nation.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref campaigner criticised for england out of scotland banner in edinburgh","story":"A Scottish independence campaigner has been criticised for holding a banner which reads #England out of Scotland# as he demonstrated in Edinburgh.Sean Clerkin, of the Scottish Resistance, was protesting outside SNP conference yesterday.James Scott, founder of the Scottish Resistance, said a meeting of the group had agreed the banner was “not acceptable” and should instead have read: “Westminster out of Scotland”. - Obesity linked to emotional problemsHe added: “Clerkin getting no support for this from the Scottish Resistance decided to go ahead with it any way.

Chairperson Ruth Verner commented: “The hard work and dedication our cadets show is a credit to them, and we are very proud to have them in our unit. “Many of the qualications earned have meant the cadets had to go away for weekends to complete the courses, and when they are at school all week their weekends are precious, so to willingly give up the time to improve their skills is admirable. “We are also pleased to have built relationships with the Army Cadet Forces and look forward to continuing to work together to help and improve our local communities.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its double delight for little daithi","story":"THE family of little Dáithí Mac Gabhann are celebrating after learning that their son has made the shortlist for the annual British Heart Foundation’s Heart Hero awards.It was discovered during a routine -week scan that little Dáithí’s heart had not developed as it should have and it was found that the now two-year-old toddler had Hypoplastic heart syndrome. At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Since the family’s ‘Is Deontóir Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July , it has since been reportedthat an increase of four percent of people in the north have opted onto the organ donation register. Dáithí’s parents Máirtín and Seph told the Andersonstown News how delighted they were to learn of the news and that their visit to London for the event in September will coincide with the toddler’s third birthday. “The British Heart Foundation run their annual Heart Hero award every year,” explained Seph.“Máirtín put in the application for it, it was basically a , word essay and we got an email the other day saying that Dáithí had been shortlisted to the last three. “The event is going to be held in the Globe Theatre in London, we are so over the moon, we can’t believe it,” she said. Seph and Máirtín also spoke of how their campaign has taken striking visual awareness with the addition of Dáithí’s pink Is Deontóir Mé slogan and picture emblazoned on a black taxi.“To see the logo on the taxi fills us with so much pride, everyone is going to see it on the road and evenit makes somebody stop and turn around, maybe think twice about organ donation for a wee second, it makes all the dference.”Máirtín added: “I can’t really put it into words how happy we are to find out that Dáithí has been shortlisted for the Heart Hero award. We have sparked up a great relationship with the British Heart Foundation for a couple of months now. They do absolutely unbelievable work that will benefit Dáithí and people like Dáithí, they also work on the promotion of organ donation as well.“In these very hard times, to hear that Dáithí is worthy of this award is great for us. “We are really looking forward to going back to London as Dáithi’s hospital is not that far from where we are going to be – not that we were looking to go into an ICU ward but we can’t wait to bring Dáithí in. The last time the staff saw him he was such a tiny baby, his chest was open, they were preparing us for the worst. Dáithi is turning three when we are over and we can’t wait to show him off to all the doctors and nurses who saved his le.”“Being from West Belfast, I’ve used black taxis all my le, five times a week, twice a day, all my le. To know we have my son on the taxi in bright pink is brilliant, everytime we see the taxi we cheer, Daithí shouts out the car window ‘meeeeeeeeeee’. We want to thank driver Micky Russell for helping us to create awareness, it looks class, we are delighted,” he said.Micky added: “There are only two things you can see from space, the Great Wall of China and my taxi,” he laughed. “It’s an absolute privilege to have the wrap around on the taxi, to create that visual awareness. The taxi is up and down the road, the Shankill, I’ve tourists in the taxi as well, they would ask ‘why the colour ’ I can say to them about organ donation and Dáithí.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"julie file locked for 45","story":"THE sister of a -year-old Lenadoon girl killed by aplastic bullet in  has hit out a decision to lock the National Archives file on her death for another  years. Julie Livingstone was ing from a local shop on the Stewartstown Road when she was fatally injured by a plastic bullet on , May . The round, which was fired from a British Army vehicle, struck her on the head and she died the next day. Earlier this week, researchers at the Pat Finucane Centre in Derry revealed that files held at the National Archives in Kew, London, relating to Julie’s death are to be kept closed until . Earlier this week it was reported that a further file relating to the plastic bullet death of a child has been locked for decades. -year-old Paul Whitters, who died on April , ,  days after being struck in the head with a plastic bullet fired by the RUC in Derry, has been closed until .It is extremely unusual for inidual files to be held on people killed in the conflict – the fact that these two files relate to schoolchildren has raised questions about why their deaths have been given such attention and what facts lie within the files that the British government wants to hide. The Northern Ireland office has said the files have been closed “in the interest of national security”. Reacting to the discovery, Julie’s sister, Elizabeth Livingstone, said that justice had been withheld from her family “for long enough”.“None of us – my brothers or sisters – are going to be alive by the time the file is opened again,it ever is,” she said. “Our parents have already passed away and nobody who ever knew Julie will be alive by then. What could possibly be pertinent to a -year-old’s death – a child’s death – that needs to be kept a secret  What is it that we’re not allowed to know about our sister’s death  We had to go through three inquests to clear Julie’s name. Ultimately, Julie was found to be an innocent victim, but that was after several years of us struggling to get a fair inquest. We already thought that justice had been withheld from us for long enough.”She continued: “It’s not a case of ‘Are they hiding something ’ This is about what’s being hidden. It’s obviously something that would prove to be an embarrassment to the British government and the NIO. Our Julie was a -year-old innocent victim. She was going about her own business when she was shot in the head and murdered. What could they possibly not want us to know about it  Your imagination runs wild. The only thing we could do for her was to get justice and now this has happened.”Paul O’Connor from the Pat Finucane Centre described the decision to close the files as “perverse”.“The decision to close Julie’s file until  was made earlier this year,” he explained. “There’s another file on plastic bullets in general, which is closed until  and it beggars belief. I have never seen anything like this before. We see lots of files closed for a long time, but these two files on the deaths of children who were killed by plastic bullets, one by the British Army, one by the RUC.” He added: “There is a total culture of secrecy within the NIO, within Ministry of Defence, and from all of those who want to protect the reputation of RUC and the British Army. They don’t want this information to come out, but it will come out. I’m confident that this file will not be closed until .”The Livingstone family have since written to the Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to request a meeting about the NIO’s decision. Relatives for Justice CEO, Mark Thompson, called on Ms Bradley to order the release of the files.“Julie was  years of age when she was killed by a plastic bullet in ,” he said. “Her father Archie travelled these islands and Europe telling the world what happened to his baby girl. Along with the other families and injured in the United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets, he wanted to make a positive dference, to shine a light of truth and justice in the face of the horror his and other families endured. All families who have experienced state violence know that the British government will go to any s to protect its own interest. This strategic policy of impunity for the killing of Irish children clearly extends even to librarians and archives keepers. They too are complicit in the policies that accompany British state violence. This decision, undoubtedly made under direction, was made while families are asked to engage in a consultation on dealing with the past. This discovery points to the bad faith behind this consultation, as well as displaying the callous indference of those responsible. The least Karen Bradley can do now is meet with the families of Julie Livingstone and Paul Whitters. The very least the keeper of the archives can do under Bradley’s instruction is give the families these files.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Feature-pic-copy.png","title":"road safety on agenda for lisnasharragh rep","story":"MANY of you will have heard about the need for road safety improvements to four specic spots in the upper Ormeau area, writes Stevie Jenkins. They are the crossing at Ormeau Road and St John’s Avenue, the intersection of Knock Eden Park and Knockbreda Road, the entrance to Cherryvale Playing Fields and outside the Good Shepherd Church. I was delighted to be able to update the community face-to-face at the inaugural ‘Empowerment through engagement’ public meeting in the newly-built Good Shepherd Parish Centre. We took those present through the criteria obtained from the Department for Infrastructure for each of the locations. There followed a very constructive conversation with the local stakeholders present. The residents, school, youth and sporting organisation leaders all had ideas about how we could work together to build a profile to meet the department’s requirements, thus speeding up progress and change. We then arranged a face-to-face meeting between the stakeholders and the department. We voiced our concerns, including the fact that, at no time in the assessment process for new crossings, was there a public consultation.Such was the success of the meeting that arrangements were made for a second meeting on mental health, an interactive session with the superb local organisations Aware, Inspire and PIPS. Each of these bodies showcased what they do and how we can improve mental wellbeing in our area. Again, the focus was on introducing the local community to important organisations who can help us to access better services. One of the most pleasant effects of the meetings is the frequency of inquiries from constituents about the next meeting. An inquisitive community is an empowered community. I am delighted to confirm that the next meeting is on local history and will take place in May."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew.

If you open a calendar on any given week you will find a reason for politicians to hold off engaging with each other..pushMarching season, conference season, elections, pressure in Westminster, negotiations in Brussels and issues within inidual parties are just a few examples.Little more than a week ago the usual script had been written, and was widely accepted, for the weeks ahead.Politicians in Westminster, Brussels, Dublin and Belfast were taking an Easter break in the assumption that there could be no engagement while local and European election campaigns were being fought in Northern Ireland in May. The script said the parties were on the doorsteps and would inevitably maintain partisan politics until the elections had past.Just after pm on Thursday April  that script was torn up by the senseless and heartbreaking murder of a woman whose name we have all come to know, Lyra McKee, whom, by the outstanding tributes of her partner, family and friends, we all wish we had known in le.As a politician and Tanaiste there are many things you experience that are unique but there are only a handful of experiences that you know will stay with you until the end of your days.Being in the front pews of St Annes Cathedral as an unstoppable wave of applause, hope and demand hit the most senior politicians from the UK and Ireland in the base of our spines is one such moment I will never forget.The words of Father Martin Magill summed up the desire and frustration of all communities in Northern Ireland in a sentence,\"Why in Gods name does it take the death of the -year old woman, with her whole le in front of her, to get to this point \"Last summer violence in Derry saw live bullets being fired and police officers narrowly escaping injury or death. In January seven young people were minutes from being killed after they passed the car bomb that sat in the centre of Derry. However, on April  the cowards claimed a victim. The fact that it was a journalist and writer who was a shining example of everything Northern Ireland can achieve is the reason so many people have come together to mourn.The night before Lyra McKees funeral I sat in Strand Road police station in Derry with the officers who had tried to save her le. These men and women are hardened by the fact that petrol bombs can be thrown at them in the course of their everyday work but on Tuesday night they were numbed and vulnerable at the fact that a young woman had died beside them. Despite their Land Rovers being alight with petrol and live ammunition being fired at them, the PSNI left its secure position to get to Lyra McKee after she had been hit. They made the decision to drive to Altnagelvin Hospital, officers performed CPR on Lyra for the entire journey and they stayed and supported her partner and friends as the horrible news of her death was confirmed. The leadership shown by the PSNI in Derry has rightly been applauded by the community it serves.While I heard Father Magills rallying call for political leadership loud and clear, I also heard what he said about the events in Derry as the news of Lyras murder sunk in: \"I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday.\"Arlene Foster, Michelle ONeill, Colum Eastwood, Robin Swann and Naomi Long were not ordered to release a joint statement by anyone or told to go into the Creggan. When a dark moment threatened to drag Northern Ireland back to a dark past their natural inclination was to do the right thing.We now have a window where the Irish and British Governments are calling the parties together. We have all spoken in person and on the phone many times in the last week and without exception I believe all the party leaders are genuine in their desire toto Stormont.As we meet in the weeks ahead, a conversation I had with Mrs Joan McKee will be foremost in my mind.Standing in the side chapel of St Annes was the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom as well as myself as Tanaiste, the Secretary of State and ministers of both governments. Despite all the power of those elected offices we were standing there as a group that was utterly powerless to comfort a woman who had, as Joan put it, \"lost her baby\".We owe it to Joan and Lyra McKee to make sure no other ceasefire babies are murdered in the prime of their lives and to make sure that Northern Ireland has a ing government.There is never a perfect time to do the right thing in Northern Ireland. However, there is a right time and that time is now.Simon Coveney is Tanaiste of the Republic of Ireland"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38048914.ece/30317/BINARY/_1FW54X-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"applause tears and laughter at a farewell like no other to lyra mckee","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they also couldnt have missed the venting of pent-up anger and frustration from ordinary people during the funeral at the political impasse of the past two years.The Belfast priest, a friend of Lyra, didnt even have to finish a sentence before mourners erupted in applause as he asked why it had taken the New IRAs murder of the journalist to unite politicians.Fr Magill took two attempts before he could complete the question: \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman with her whole le in front of her to get to this point \"Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingThe coffin of journalist Lyra McKee is taken out of the church after her funeral at St Annes Cathedral on April ,  in Belfast, Northern Ireland.Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Theresa May pictured at the funeral and service of thanksgiving for the le of journalist Lyra McKee and Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish Prime minister Leo Varadkarand Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Sara Canning, partner of the murdered journalist Lyra McKee as her funeral takes place at St. Annes Cathedral  and Irish President Michael D Higgins pictured at and at the funeral.

Lyra McKee was murdered in Creggan in Derry on Thursday th April.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"The funeral of Journalist Lyra McKee takes place at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  \"Mourners begin to gather for the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  In a response redolent of what happened at Princess Dianas funeral in London in , hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cathedral also clapped as they listened to a relay of the priests words in Donegall Street, where from early morning it was obvious that Lyras send-off was going to be a funeral like no other.Young people dressed in the colourful garb of Harry Potter characters and comic book heroes came in their hundreds to say their painful farewells, but also to give thanks for their slain friend, who they called \"a girl in a million\".Some mourners carried rainbow flags in honour of Lyra, a committed campaigner for LGBT rights.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took time out from their fraught Brexit negotiations to join Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to pay tribute to Lyra.Few disputed the north Belfast author and journalist was destined to write herself into the annals of the great wordsmiths, but sadly she made headlines of horror and heartbreak across the globe after being killed by dissident republicans.One friend said she hoped the message from yesterdays funeral that would go out around the world would be how the murder had crystallised the fact that there was for once at least a united Ireland - united in abhorrence of Lyras murder by a New IRA gunman.However, the tears of sorrow yesterday for Lyra were also fused with tears of laughter as her friends and family celebrated her remarkable le that, they said, was full of fun and joy. And compassion and love.People from a myriad of backgrounds, from all generations, of all sexual orientations and from all religions and none, showed the world - which Lyra had at her talented feet - an unmistakable and unshakeable determination that they will not allow her death to have been in vain, and that as in her le, her passing must make a dference.It was also a powerful message that the New IRA must listen to the demands that it should give up violence once and for all.Even the choice of St Annes Cathedral for the service was powerfully symbolic in itself, a recognition of an all-too-rare shared space in what has been a ided city.Only pre-eminent churchmen, sports stars, business leaders and musicians are usually accorded funeral services in the historic building.And normally they have been older men and women who have lived their lives, not a young woman who was still on the threshold of hers and who wasnt even born of the Protestant persuasion.The service was broadcast live by the British-based  hour news channels and dozens of photographers and journalists from English newspapers were in attendance.Lyras murder may have catapulted her into the public domain, but at her funeral her love for her family was also underscored by inspiring addresses about the private side of the daughter who would phone her mother Joan  times a day to check that she was all right - \"even when she was upstairs\".Lyras sister Nichola Corner spoke on behalf of herself, her distraught mother, her sisters Joan and Mary and brothers Gary and David.Nichola told mourners that Lyra had been buried with a flower in her hair in response to her love of the Scott McKenzie song San Francisco.She said the family didnt have Dumbledores time turner to change the past.\"But within each of us we have the power to create the kind of society that Lyra envisioned,\" she added.\"In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now lets get to work.\"Lyras friend Stephen Lusty - a self-avowed \"middle-class, middle-aged Protestant heterosexual British male engineer\" - told the congregation that she had told him just hours before she died that she was going to propose to her partner Sara Canning in New York.\"She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,\" said Mr Lusty.\"She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in  and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter, and to find or refind my own version of Sara.\"He laughingly referred to the questions she would ask him out of the blue about whether it was closer to drive to Derry or Londonderry, or why Protestants ate more vegetables than Catholics.Mr Lusty said that after he introduced the indefatigable Lyra to the late southern politician Brian Lenihan, he described her as a \"star\".But he added: \"I would rather do  rounds in the boxing ring with Paisley than do that again.\"He said that in her online journalistic work Lyra received \"more than her fair share of cyber abuse and trolling, but she never hated anyone\".He said his generation had sung about an alternative Ulster - the words of a song by Belfast punk band Stf Little Fingers - but added that people here should now build an alternative Ulster and make peace a lasting legacy of Lyra McKee.Speaking at the beginning of the service, Dean Stephen Forde said: \"Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in le, this is her legacy in death.\"As a journalist she pursued truth wherever it took her, never content with the sullen silence of unanswered questions.\"She was a child of the Good Friday Agreement.\"She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the Agreement was signed.\"She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past and open to the possibilities of a new future for the people of these islands.\"In her short le Lyra had amassed an extensive network of friends and influential contacts, especially in the realms of crusading and investigative journalism.And the esteem in which she was held was reflected in the fact that upwards of  writers and broadcasters formed a guard of honour for her as her coffin was carried out of the cathedral.The size of the overall attendance underlined the reality that St Annes was the only church big enough to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects to the diminutive girl with the towering and prodigious spirit from a couple of miles up the road in Ardoyne.For many of the people at the service it was their first ever visit to the Church of Ireland cathedral.Lyras family had requested that everyone should give her a dignied send-off but the -minute service wasnt all about solemnity and sadness. Lyras partner Sara had said on Facebook that the \"love of her le\" would like itpeople would wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel-related items at the service.Her friends didnt let her down and Hufflepuff colours were everywhere on scarves and T-shirts emblazoned with #teamlyra.No one was expecting to see DUP leader Arlene Foster or Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill wearing Hogwarts outfits.But the fact that they were there at all was interpreted by many as a sign of hope.However, that is what many commentators said when the same duo shook hands at the Requiem Mass for Martin McGuinness in the Bogside just over two years ago.\"And look what good that did us,\" one observer pointed out yesterday.But she added: \"The only dference today is that the calls at the funeral were so vocerous and so unanimous that its hard to see how they can be ignored.\"Famous faces voice support for familyAs hundreds gathered at St Anne’s Cathedral yesterday for the funeral of Lyra McKee, many other prominent voices shared their support on social media.Comedian Patrick Kielty posted: “Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told.”Actress Bronagh Waugh said: “Thinking of Lyra’s family and friends and partner Sara who have the unfathomable burden of laying her to rest today.“Thinking of the people of Derry, of Belfast. But most of all I’m thinking about Lyra and what a bright and shining light she was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"bangor home totally ransacked after burglary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exunionist mps country pile sells after three years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The ferry is a real benefit to Strangford, it canrsquot be a liability.Cllr Enright claimed that the DfI ldquoin order to save on staff costs, have not been using the queuing area on the Strangford side.During a recent meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, roads officials confirmed that they were evaluating introducing an earlier morning sailing from Portaferry to Strangford.Councillor Gareth Sharvin said he was also concerned about the regular traffic congestion in Strangford after being contacted by local people caught up in the weekend traffic jam.He said: ldquoI donrsquot understand why there is ferry traffic congestion when there are good ferry traffic lines around the harbour. I will be contacting the Departmentrsquos permanent secretary, Katrina Godfrey, to have a full review and overhaul of the ferry services to ensure that this does not happen again.Strangford businessman, Robert Duffy, owner of a Mace grocery store, confirmed that the village was snarled up with traffic on Saturday evening but reported traffic and the ferry had been running smoothly over the rest of the Easter bank holiday weekend.However, Mr Duffy added: ldquoThe traffic was only bad for a couple of hours on Saturday evening and it was compounded by Saturday night mass in Strangford.ldquoSaturdayrsquos problem was that there was only one boat on. There was racing in Kirkistown and you had between  and  motorhomes travelling from Bishopscourt and that happens every single year.ldquoIrsquove been here  years and it is what it is ndash holiday traffic.

The Town Committee asked for the money to go towards a two-week festival they are organising in the town this summer.But councillors bluntly pointed out this week that they have already pumping enough money into the resort for other activities and had already sufficiently helped the Town Committee.Councillors pointed out that the council had spent a ldquovery considerable amount of money in promoting a nine-week summer entertainment programme in Newcastle and had given specic help to the Town Committee in the funding of a joint press conference, advertising and publicity material, as well as providing Radio Newcastle and other facilities.Because of all this ldquoit would not be appropriate to gibe a cash grant in addition.However, the decision did not go down well with Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth, who said it was regrettable that the council had decided to give nothing to the Town Committee.She thought thatthe council could not help by giving the full pound, they should at least have given a part and she hoped the council would have another look at the request.Newcastle councillor Mr Norman Bicker, a member of the Town Committee, said he hoped the council might be able to do something, but he realised there was already a big council programme and he agreed that it was not possible to allow more money.The councilrsquos recreation officer, Mr Bryan Coburn, also pointed out that there was already considerable investment in finance and labour in Newcastle and he felt it would not be appropriate to give more.BALLYGOWAN mdash Bicycling Ballygowan minister, the Rev James Harper, peddled into town last week with a beaming smile on his face for he had just taken part in a smash hit -mile cycle to raise funds to build a new hall in his area.Mr Harper led a team of  modern bikes into Ballygowan on an  year-old penny farthing, which had been loaned to him by cycling enthusiast Albert Watson.The sponsored -mile bike ride took in Raffrey, Derryboy, the Pikestone, Crossgar and Saintfield. Between pound and pound was raised.Itrsquos not the first time Mr Harper, minister of Ballygowan Presbyterian Church, has come up with unusual ideas to raise money. When ministering in Killyleagh he took part in a sponsored bed push and also cycled on a tandem.Coping with the penny farthing proved easier than Mr Harper expected. ldquoIt was remarkably comfortable and I felt really refreshed after the journey, he said.ldquoThere was only one problem mdash it had no brakes, but the police helped us by going ahead to make sure the way was clear.The penny farthing dates from  and is ft in high. Mr Harper only got one half-hour practice to get the feel of it before setting out on the y journey.DOWNPATRICK mdash A proposal to locate a regional museum in Downpatrick has been supported by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Board members want to be involved in the museumrsquos management together with local councillors.The recommendation is that the museum should be the responsibility of the district council, but Board member Mr Jack Magee believes the concept is too narrow.Board members want top priority to be given to recruiting a pool of staff for regional museums and that they should be seconded for proper professional training to acquire a professional qualication.Meanwhile, Down Council is pressing ahead with its own plans to establish a museum in Downpatrick.The council museum was started before the announcement that Downpatrick had been nominated as the location for a regional museum and it is believed that the council museum will be used as the basis for the regional museum.Councillors have accepted that it will be some time before money will be made available for the appointment of museum staff, so a full-time curator is now needed to enable their lsquoDown Museumrsquo to progress properly.It has been confirmed that until the appointment is made, Mr Albert Colmer, chairman of the Lecale Historical Society, will continue to act as curator.STRANGFORD mdash The Strangford Ferry fares will be increased next week, despite strong protests from Ards and Down councillors and members of Portaferry Development Committee.Representatives from all three groups recently met with the Department of Roads Service, which operates the ferry, and were told that the increases were the absolute minimum which could be implemented.Down councillor Mr John Ritchie said he was told that the fares should meet at least % of the servicersquos running costs, which now stood at nearly pound, a year.KILLYLEAGH mdash The blueprint for Killyleaghrsquos one-day festival of family fun in June was revealed at a public meeting in the Cooke Hall in the town.The planned programme, ranging from car slalom, marathon darts, senior citizensrsquo talent contest and yard of ale competition, makes impressive reading, attempting as it does to involve the whole community.ldquoWe must put Killyleagh on the map, was the message message hammered home at the meeting by Mr Winston Maguire, chairman of Killyleagh Town Committee.The organisers received an enormous boost when local hotelier Mr Harry Briggs offered free of charge for three nights the main hall of the Dunmore Hotel.The organisers have appealed for sponsorship, especially donations for prizes. The townspeople will not only enjoy the one-day festival, but any profits made from the event will be ploughed back to provide Christmas lights for the townrsquos streets.DRUMAROAD mdash Outbreaks of sheep worrying hit the area at the weekend when more than  lambs were savagely attacked and killed by marauding dogs.Mr P J McGrady, a farmer from Drumaroad, lost ten lambs over the weekend, He spotted a black dog with white spots on his land and he rushed into his house for his shotgun, but the dog had gone when he went outside.BALLYNAHINCH mdash A pair of talented Ballynahinch sisters, Lesley and Gail Newham, are among four students from the South Eastern Music Centre who travelled to Grantham in Lincolnshire with the British Youth Symphony Orchestra this week.This is the second year in succession that the sisters have been chosen to join the  young musicians from all over the UK who will be giving concerts for the next two weeks.Mr David Newham, father of  year-old Lesley, who plays a horn, and  year-old Gail, an oboeist, is director and advisor of music for the South Eastern Education and Library Board.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A speedboat with the engine still attached was found drting in Strangford Lough close to Don OrsquoNeill Island on Saturday by Mr Paul McCann, of  Springvale Park, Dpwnpatrick.The speedboat was taken to a temporary mooring at Castleward Bay provided by Strangford Sailing Club.

The event was finished off by further prayers and hymns with soup served to all.The call for the Church of Ireland community to boycott the event was ignored as several additional ministers attended the event for the first time.Former Bishop Trevor Williams, recently retired from the Church of Ireland diocese of Limerick and Killaloe and former rector of Newcastle, said he felt it was important to attend the event.ldquoThe Christian message for me is one primarily of love and concern for others and on this Good Friday thatrsquos precisely the message, the cross of Jesus Christ and what he gave to the world, he said.ldquoJesus said love one another as I have loved you so that is the importance of this day. We learn most from those who are dferent so this walk today gives us an opportunity to realise that each of our traditions have something to offer, each has something to learn from each other.Church of Ireland minister, the Rev Adrian Dorrian from the Lecale group of churches, said he felt it was important to attend the walk.ldquoWe have a similar walk of witness in Downpatrick today, he said. ldquoBut, given the coverage this year and the protest letter which we disagree strongly with, we wanted to show support. Dean Henry Hull would have been here but he has other Good Friday service commitments. Irsquom very glad to have been able to come and represent the other churches in the town.Castlewellan parish priest, Fr Denis McKinlay, said: ldquoItrsquos been a great turnout today and great show of support and solidarity from some very important people. After all it is a peace walk and itrsquos about peace, reconciliation and hope and we all have to learn from one another. Surely that has to be a great thing In welcoming the walkers to St Paulrsquos, the Rev Brian Cadden said: ldquoIt is a real sense of joy today, despite dferent expressions of the Christian faith, that we can come together to share the most basic aspect of our faith which is the death of Jesus Christ on the cross.St Malachyrsquos parishioners, Harry and Margaret McCartan from Newcastle, have attended the walk for years.Mr McCartan said why there were there: ldquoTo bear witness with our Christian neighbours, thatrsquos what it is all about, he said.ldquoThatrsquos exactly it, this is nothing to do with politics, added Mrs McCartan.He continued: ldquoWhy be a Christianyou are afraid to show it Gerald King from Annsborough said he attended the walk due to recent newspaper coverage.ldquoI came today after seeing that letter because them men are wrong, he said. ldquoLove one another as I have loved you, thatrsquos what this is about.St Malachyrsquos parishioner Mary Steele, who walks every year, said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely and peaceful and calm. Itrsquos a prayerful day and it should be. Good Friday is the day and the resurrection is the day. Let those without sin cast the first stone.Fellow St Malachyrsquos parishioner Philomena Rice was there with her three grandchildren as she has done in previous years.ldquoI think itrsquos important to show my grandchildren the other church, she said. ldquoThey like coming out to this, carrying the cross as they call it.Ronnie Hamilton, secretary of the Castlewellan Area Bible Prayer Group said: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the turnout today and itrsquos more than we normally have.

As he sat on top of the mountain with no name, counting all the athletes as they reached the summit and the yellow sun began to set over the rolling green hills, he thought to himself that this was truly a place of beauty to be shared with like-minded people.

Main buildings around the world were turned green to mark this day.ldquoAnd, as the Good Friday Agreement comes under pressure, St Patrick speaks to a shared heritage across this island. And he should be a force for reconciliation right now.Mr Coveney added: ldquoThere should never be ision in this island and we should share the richness of his story. St Patrick is a treasure to us all.ldquoA treasure to those of faith and to those with no faith at all. He challenged this island and found courage, redemption and transformation.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, discussed the grave of St Patrick with Mr Coveney and other clergy and politicians.Dean Hull added: ldquoSt Patrick probably died in his church at Saul and was driven by a cart and four oxen, which settled on the hill in Downpatrick, where he was buried. As was the custom, Patrickrsquos remains were subject to becoming reliquaries and part of his jaw bone is in the Down County Museum today..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Traders fume at roadworks delay  ","story":"WORK on a major public realm scheme at Irish Street in Downpatrick is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned, sparking a furious reaction from traders.Work on the near pound, scheme was due to complete at the end of March but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced. It is understood that it could be early July before this work is completed.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme to provide new paving, street lighting and furniture in Irish Street with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have now arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base, but of major concern is problems with the sewer network.A series of frenetic phone calls to politicians and NI Water were made recently after raw sewage flowed out of an old section of piping for over a week.Businesses say they have been told that major sections of the sewer network need replaced and that contractors recently discovered that one large section of the sewer was completely blocked with concrete and has most probably been like this for decades.All businesses have reported a downturn in trade since work in Irish Street started and a temporary one-way traffic system was introduced, while there is concern that a number of parking spaces have been lost and that the width of the main street has been substantially narrowed in places.Calls have been issued for a rates reduction given the impact the work has had on business with traders highlighting that the delay in completing the scheme, ironically designed to help attract more shoppers, is outside their control but has had a signicant impact upon them.Mr Alan Oakes, of Plus  Print, said the sewer outside his business collapsed for eight days, with main contractors apologising for what was happening.ldquoTrade has been poor since the works started on January  and with further realistic delays forthcoming, we donrsquot know what the future might hold, he said.ldquoOne business in Irish Street has now closed, traffic is at a standstill, deliveries are impossible and collection from businesses is a nightmare while footfall is at zero. The management of the entire streetscape has been disastrous from day one and now more delays are anticipated.Mr Oakes said what concerns him most has been the lack of communication provided by Newry, Mourne and Down Council. He also fears that the sewage infrastructure in Irish Street is at breaking point.He added: ldquoWe are a family-run business with  yearsrsquo experience in the town and an employer. These past few months been very testing and dficult for all businesses in Irish Street.Another trader said that given the loss in trade businesses have experienced, they should be entitled to a rates rebate.He said: ldquoWe all accepted that the street upgrade was needed but the work was supposed to take three months. Now they are saying that it will be the end of June and even into July before it is completed. What is going on ldquoEveryone has taken a hit and, given that fact, we deserve a rates rebate. Business is hard enough without having to put up with this. We were told the work would take three months, but we will be into a seventh month before this over.A spokeswoman for the Department of Infrastructure said the Irish Street scheme is a project it is managing on behalf of Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities.ldquoThis is a full refurbishment of the existing streetscape, with the provision of new street lighting, street furniture and carriageway resurfacing, she explained.ldquoUnfortunately the scheme has encountered a signicant number of unexpected delays due to utility alterations and dficulties with construction around the old blast wall foundations at the PSNI station.The spokeswoman confirmed that in consultation with the contractor carrying out the work, it is now anticipated that further delays are ldquounfortunately unavoidable at this stage with the finish date of the main paving works now expected to be June .She also revealed that a full road closure will then be required to carry out resurfacing of the carriageway.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWhile we appreciate this unavoidable delay has caused concern, please be assured that all measures to expedite works are being taken.South Down MLA, Colin McGrath, said it was ldquodisappointing to learn that the completion of roadworks at Irish Street have been delayed until the end of June.ldquoWhile residents and business owners will want to see the work completed to the highest standard, that this will be at the cost of another two monthsrsquo interruption which is disheartening. If the work can be completed ahead of schedule this would be welcomed, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Work set to resume at old Downe  ","story":"BUILDING work on a new social housing project at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick is due to resume in the near future.Contractors moved off site a few weeks ago after laying foundations for a number of new homes whichare being built on behalf of Clanmill Housing.An initial  homes are being built part as part of a major social housing project at the site where around  new homes could eventually be constructed.While concern has recently been expressed locally about the halt to construction work at the site,Clanmill has explained that there is a valid reason.The social housing provider said it is aware that work at the sprawling town centre site mdash which borders four main roads mdash has ceased for a short period of time.ldquoThe developerrsquos subcontractor is awaiting the arrival on site of a piling rig to allow work to continue, she explained.ldquoWe appreciate the continued support and patience of local residents as construction continues and are looking forward to welcoming families to the first phase of the development later in the year as planned.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.Itrsquos understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, is pleased that the suspension to building work is only temporary.ldquoThe redevelopment of the former hospital site will go some way to reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick, he said.ldquoThe Clanmill project is an eagerly awaited development. Not only will it provide much-needed new homes, but greatly assist with the social and economic regeneration of this particular part of the town.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They wereStudent Centred.”Right from the time he entered the Interview room when the College were seeking to appoint a Principal in December  until the last Board of Governors on  March  he breathed, talked and delivered for young people.“ He was a committed professional and educationalist who heart embraced his students and staff.“Simon loved travelling the world and being outdoors so it is justly fitting his last hours were with his passion.“At this time we would wish to send our heartfelt condolences to Mr Harpers partner, his family and friends. He will be greatly missed at Portadown College.\"Mr Harper had been on a trip to Scotland when he passed away suddenly.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/stats_r1.jpg","title":"statsports takes on premier leagues alex oxlade chamberlain and raheem sterling","story":"Posted on Thursday  April  by Ulster Business Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and chief global strategist Jarlath Quinn Newry firm STATSports have taken on board Premier League players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling as signicant investors as well as global ambassadors for the burgeoning tech firm.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive.
