Meghan is expected to begin the visit by adding her voice to the thousands who have spoken out about the rising violence against women in South Africa.Meghan, who is a champion of gender equality, is likely to raise the issue when her tour of South Africa with husband Harry and their son Archie starts on Monday.The couple\u0027s first event will be a visit to a Township in Cape Town, where they will tour a workshop that provides a range of services to young people, including self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.Campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town earlier this month to protest at what they claimed was their government\u0027s failure to deal with the problem, following a series of attacks that have shocked the African nation.It is understood Meghan and Harry watched the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa\u0027s address to his country following days of protests, when he acknowledged the African nation was facing a national crisis of violence against women.The former actress is an active humanitarian campaigner – particularly on the topic of gender equality – who has spoken about women\u0027s empowerment.Meghan\u0027s activism famously started at a young age. At 11 she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.The Sussexes\u0027 first tour as a family comes after the duke and duchess flew to Rome to watch Meghan\u0027s close friend, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, marry oil tycoon Michael Hess on Friday.Among the guests at the lavish celebration were Harry\u0027s cousins Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, US president Donald Trump\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, and actor James Corden.

The economists used data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to explore whether a group of 342 people who have had lottery wins in the past 15 years saw an increase in happinessThe pair said they were able to offer results \u0027more in accord with common sense and economic theory\u0027 by analyzing a \u0027greater number\u0027 of large winners than has been possible in the past.Their theory was first explored by Phillip Brickman and his colleagues in 1978, who considered whether big life events - like winning the lottery - had any impact on happiness.Brickman was testing adaptation-level theory, which says those who experience major positive life events should not be considerably happier, because they struggle to find joy in ordinary events.The academics interviewed 29 paralyzed victims, 22 lottery winners, and 22 people who were neither winners nor victims for the study.   All those involved in the study were asked to rate how happy they were at the time, and how happy they anticipated being in two years.

Callie Rogers (pictured) spent her £1.87million fortune on cosmetic surgery, drugs and partying, but she said she is now much happierBut despite the fact he no longer has a home or a car to call \u0027his own\u0027, Mr Carroll insisted he is \u0027not bitter\u0027 about the loss of wealth.Speaking to the Sun, he said: \u0027I hump around 50kg bags of coal and I chop the logs that are sold at filling stations.\u0027My £10million vanished in just ten years and I don\u0027t have a home or a car to call my own.

Visitors have the opportunity to dip in and out, so if you miss one piece you can come back in the same day.”Leckey is returning to Tate Britain for the first time since he won the Turner Prize there in 2008. Always difficult to categorise, his three works explore themes of youth, class, memory and nostalgia.There is one new work and two that are considered seminal to his career. One is Fiorucci Made Me Hardcore from 1990, a compilation of dancefloor footage from Northern soul to rave, which was described in the  as “perhaps the finest portrayal of British nightlife ever captured”.The other is Dream English Kid, 1964-1999 AD, a video work dating from 2015 prompted by Leckey’s discovery of a YouTube video of a Joy Division gig he was at in 1979.The new work in the show stems directly from his memories of the bridge. Under Under In, filmed on iPhones, tells a story of five teenagers under a bridge haunted by fairies, and what happens when one of the children gets abducted.Leckey said his childhood memories were vague ones. “When I was in here yesterday I realised what the show is about, it is about recollection and how things get recalled.”Tate Britain’s director Alex Farquharson said it was less an exhibition and more “an audio-visual play” in which Leckey mixes up “all manner of ways of seeing the world – biography, social history, pop culture, anthropology, magic, the unexplained”.

It’s a very human tale told with the verve of a novelist, the detail of a diarist and the grace of a poet.” – dylan37“The one novel I’ve read from the century to date that I am sure will stay with me for the rest of my life, for personal as well as for general reasons, is The Hunger Angel by Herta Müller (translated by Philip Boehm in 2012). It was published in German as Atemschaukel in 2009, just before she (deservedly) won the Nobel prize for literature. It’s an extraordinarily dense and poetic work and one that seems to transcend language – so perfectly written that text and idea are fused, yet still overflowing with humanity.” – nilpferd“I also rate The City and the City very highly but Perdido Street Station by China Miéville (2000) is the one I’ve reread a couple of times since I first came across it. The world he builds is convincing and immersive, whereas in some of his later work it can feel like the ideas he wants to explore take primacy over character development, plot and setting.” – Vonnegut“The People’s Act of Love by James Meek (2005) is like a classic Russian masterpiece, written by a British author, dark and a bit twisted.” – BParker“Very surprised not to see any of Amitav Ghosh’s Ibis Trilogy (2008-2015). Historical writing very much for our time, set in the 1830s when drugs, capital, indentured labour and languages themselves were moving across the seas between Britain, India and China. Ghosh juggles the fates of multiple and memorable British, Indian and Chinese characters with some glorious writing, especially about ships and the sea.” – bertilek“We Need to Talk About Kevin by Lionel Shriver (2003) is one of the most disturbing, unstoppable and unforgettable books I’ve ever read. Incredibly well written and a sucker punch twist at the end.” – MajorJackCelliers“Was waiting and waiting for Reasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig (2015) to appear. Very intelligently written, beautiful, heartbreaking and life-affirming and SO important – it has saved countless lives. Can’t imagine a more important book.” – gadget“East West Street by Phillippe Sands (2016) is a work of startling humanity, timely importance, magisterial prose and emotional depth. Not many laughs, I grant you, but on any measure it beats most of the non-fiction on this list into a cocked hat.” – MartyPines“Convenience Store Woman by Sakata Murata (2016, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori in 2018) and Quiet by Susan Cain (2012). Convenience Store Woman was short but brilliant, with incisive observations about Japanese society, convenience store ‘culture’ and how ‘outsiders’ and those with mental health conditions are often maligned and misunderstood by society. Quiet was a fascinating read with eye-opening revelations on how soft-spoken and shy iniduals often don’t receive the credit they deserve.” – piggywigee“The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (2007) was the first time I had seen a clear explanation of the two types of statistics that explain clearly “normal” events and statistically “fractal” ones such as stock-market crashes and delayed projects. It also made me realise how poorly educated we are.” – Maclon“The Rest Is Noise by Alex Ross (2007), his superb survey of 20th -century music, which makes you want to listen immediately to each and every piece he discusses Anathem by Neal Stephenson (2008), which takes you from monkish cloisters to the stars in bravura style Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel (2016), which gives the most illuminating insight into … illuminated manuscripts (something you never thought you’d find interesting, but read this and you will!) and The Algebraist by Iain Banks (2004). (There has to be something by Banksie in any list of this sort – perhaps you’d prefer Transition, but anyway, he knocks spots off yer McEwans, Rowlings and Amises.)“ – Dogbertd“Stephen Baxter’s Space (2000). The hardest of hard science fiction authors (save for perhaps Kim Stanley Robinson), and also the one with the most “out there” ideas. Never more epic than the climax of Space. The book is an incredible answer to Fermi’s Paradox … you’ll remember Space forever. It answers everything.” – dholliday“I’d just add a shout out for Liu Cixin’s Three Body Problem (2008, translated by Ken Liu in 2014). A really different hard science fiction take on “are we alone in the universe and why has no one contacted us yet”, made more intriguing by the fact it was originally written in Chinese and therefore has totally different cultural assumptions to our usual western sci-fi.” – yazbod“Adrian Desmond and James Moore’s Darwin’s Sacred Cause (2009) is the companion and follow-up to these authors’ 1991 biography of Darwin. Once read, all of the attacks on Darwin can be dismissed as you will know far more than any antagonist.

And their money was on the airline collapsing.For the second time in the space of two years, the Civil Aviation Authority was secretly putting together its own pop-up airline, and this was even bigger than the last one, assembled to repatriate stranded Monarch passengers in 2017.Some 150,000 Thomas Cook customers had flown abroad on holiday, many blissfully unaware that the return leg was in jeopardy. The CAA regulated Thomas Cook in two ways: through its airline operating certificate and its Atol licence, which guarantees customers their holiday should a firm go bust. Both involved scrutinising its finances for solvency. The Atol licence was due for renewal in two weeks. And the CAA had seen enough.Hope of a rescue deal still officially remained: banks extending credit or even the government stepping in. But despite that hope, Operation Matterhorn was launched.Discreet feelers had been put out for weeks, discussed under the Matterhorn codename to minimise the risk of leaks, to assess the availability of potential rescue aircraft. The grounding of the 737 Max posed an additional headache: other airlines were already using airline leasing firms to fill their schedules.But the CAA had been here before, and honed its act. The rescue of XL Airways passengers after that went bust in 2008 wasn’t perfect – officials still joke about dodgy jumbos – but the blueprint has been clear since two Monarch operations: one in 2016 that was eventually not needed as the airline hung on for grim life, and then the successful repatriation when it collapsed a year later.With non-disclosure agreements signed, and handling firms and airline operations teams sounded out in commercial confidence, CAA officials in the Canary Wharf HQ had laid out a plan for almost 50 planes to plug the gaps.It would take at least 48 hours to get alternative aircraft into position to run the Thomas Cook schedule – and that meant paying out for an entire shadow operation even though the airline could, conceivably, still be taking passengers on Monday.It also risked precipitating the very thing the CAA hoped to avoid: a collapse in consumer and investor confidence in the airline. In a world of flight-tracking website and social media, hopes for complete secrecy were faint once Matterhorn had kicked in.But the alternative to shelling out millions on substitute planes now was for the first group of Thomas Cook passengers – some 16,000 were due to fly home daily – to be stranded until Wednesday or longer.At a minimum, that would spell uncertainty and rack up hotel bills that the CAA – under Atol – would have to eventually cover. At worst, if passengers lacked accommodation, it could spell overcrowding in airports, panic and the spectre of public disorder.The button was pressed and a comprehensive website of information, matching each doomed Thomas Cook inbound flight, set to go.Volunteers at the CAA – many who had worked through the Monarch collapse in 2017 – were contacted inidually on Sunday, and posted to Gatwick and other airports around the country for 2am on Monday, ready for the announcement of Thomas Cook’s liquidation. They were to stand ready to advise any passengers arriving for flights of the overnight news, their rights and how to obtain refunds for holidays that were not to happen.The Foreign Office was meanwhile coordinating the discreet dispatch of staff to help at airports abroad – along with some Thomas Cook employees, still working for passengers without hope of a pay cheque.On Sunday night, that Malaysian Airlines A380 touched down in Manchester, part of a worldwide safety net that had brought in charter planes from the US, Canada and Portugal.Some of the contracting was straightforward: the likes of Titan Airways and Hi-Fly exist to regularly fill gaps in the scheduled airline market. They are extra planes, with pilots and crew, for hire by big names when circumstances demand.Others also stepped in to the breach, exceptionally for Matterhorn: easyJet will devote one of its 14 A320s on standby for the rescue flights, while Virgin and BA made rows of transatlantic seats available for the CAA alone.Far fewer planes will be needed next week, with no more outbound holidaymakers. The bureaucracy of dealing with tens of thousands of passengers complaints and cases through the Atol scheme is also averted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce133475d1cdd06f4e9cc6a83838faa34300b846/566_610_5260_3156/master/5260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c18c24913317a67adf376e68c3228280","title":"investors snub metro banks 250m bond sale","story":" Bank has been forced to cancel a bond sale of up to £250m after failing to drum up interest from investors, marking a setback for the lender struggling to recover from an accounting blunder earlier this year.The challenger bank had been trying to sell its debt to investors to meet EU regulatory requirements, which would help it wind down effectively in a crisis without using taxpayer cash.While the lender blamed poor market conditions for a lack of appetite for its debt, others said it signalled that confidence in ’s strategy was starting to erode.John Cronin, a financial analyst for stockbroker Goodbody, said: “It would appear that  Bank has failed to secure sufficient interest even at this level, which points to a major lack of confidence in the continued adequacy of the bank’s capital position, as well as its ability to generate sufficient profits in the future.”He added that it was unlikely that  Bank would return to the market later this year to reissue the bonds, and may be forced to ask the Bank of England to postpone a deadline for meeting its minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) by the of 2019.Another failed bond sale could prove embarrassing for  Bank, which has been working to repair its reputation following a major accounting mistake earlier this year.In January  Bank revealed it had misclassified loans worth £900m as being less risky than they were. The discovery meant the bank had a smaller capital cushion to protect it from a larger pool of risky loans in the event of a downturn. The mistake prompted an investigation by City regulators, which was recently widened to include  Bank’s senior managers. That investigation is still underway. Bank said in a statement: “Given the current market conditions  Bank has decided to not proceed with a transaction at this time.  Bank has a strong capital position and therefore the flexibility to raise MREL at the right time for the bank.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1985da8ce5a57cf3e02bd204fbddf9b8f8fde84/0_136_3942_2365/master/3942.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a02797b841c704657993742495d779d","title":"neil woodford buying up ftse 100 shares after fund suspension","story":"Woodford Investment Management reveals investments in blue chip stocksThe beleaguered fund manager apologised to investors still trapped in the Woodford Equity Income Fund, and confirmed that their cash would likely stay gated until early December.The fund manager blamed poor performance in recent weeks on its investment in Benevolent AI, a British healthcare company that uses artificial intelligence in drug development.

They were willing to invest to limit the potential damage to their tourism industries.The Spanish hoteliers were led by billionaire hotelier Miguel Fluxà Rosselló and offered to invest €107m (£95m) according to reports in the Spanish media.But the rescue plan fell apart after the British government said it was not prepared to provide any financial guarantees to underpin the funding package.Once the government’s lack of confidence in Thomas Cook leaked out, the source said, support in Spain and Turkey for the precariously-constructed deal “melted away”.“Two governments were prepared to back a British brand, the UK government wasn’t,” said the source. “Without that, there wasn’t enough confidence around the table to make it work.”Separately, the German government was reportedly considering providing Thomas Cook subsidiary airline Condor with a bridging loan, allowing the company to keep flying. Condor flights were still taking place on Monday. Labour and trade unions criticised the government for not doing enough to prevent one of the most high-profile corporate failures in British history. No 10 said it could not justify spending taxpayers’ money to keep a struggling business afloat.A No 10 spokeswoman added: “A bailout would not have been a good use of taxpayers’ money. We would have had to repatriate people later down the line and have lost more money in the process,” a No 10 spokeswoman said.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Thomas Cook would not have been a good investment and suggested putting in government cash would only have delayed its inevitable collapse. “I think if we’d seen a business that clearly had hot prospects and all it needed was something very simple and then it would carry on, that would be very different. I don’t think that there was a route through to pumping in taxpayers’ money and then actually avoiding today.”But the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, insisted government intervention could have provided “breathing space”.“To just stand to one side and watch this number of jobs go, and so many holidaymakers have their holiday ruined, I just don’t think that’s wise government,” he said.The first signs rescue talks had failed came on Sunday when executives left a crunch meeting with banks and shareholders without reaching a deal. Within hours the tour operator’s flights disappeared from flight websites such as Skyscanner.Just after midnight officials from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) arrived at the airport to impound one of its planes. The last Thomas Cook flight, from Orlando to Manchester, touched down at 8.52am at Manchester airport on Monday morning. Crew members were said to have been moved to tears after passengers organised a whip-round for them. Passengers on one of the last official Thomas Cook flights, from Lanzarote to London Gatwick, praised the behaviour of cabin crew who knew their jobs were at risk.Joe Jeness, 34, said: “After we touched down the crew were visibly upset. One of the air hostesses had tears in her eyes when we got off the plane and we saw others hugging each other. The captain came and stood at the exit with the crew and every passenger who got off the plane wished them well. It was heartbreaking.”The CAA has chartered more than 40 aircraft, including from the US and Malaysia, to bring customers home from 18 countries, after Thomas Cook’s own planes were grounded. The repatriation is expected to incur costs of more than £100m, borne by the Department for Transport.Former transport minister Chris Grayling had promised to introduce a new levy-funded regime to keep bankrupt airlines flying temporarily, after the collapse of Monarch in 2017 cost the government £60m. No legislation has been introduced so far.While customers stuck abroad are being flown home, hundreds of thousands of customers’ bookings for holidays and flights have been cancelled, including dream weddings. Staff at the company’s Peterborough headquarters and in its 560 high street shops were formally notified of the collapse on Monday morning. “It is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful,” said the chief executive, Peter Fankhauser. “This marks a deeply sad day for the company.” Many staff left the building in tears.The government’s insolvency service is expected to fund redundancy payments for UK staff, although trade union sources said it was unclear if they would be paid next week.The business minister, Andrea Leadsom, has written to the insolvency service asking it to investigate the role of directors in the company’s demise. Leadsom also wants reassurances about the firm’s pension scheme.Labour called on its last three chief executives – Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Fankhauser – to hand back some of the £35m they were collectively paid in recent years.Thomas Cook buckled under the weight of a £1.7bn debt pile racked up during an ill-fated acquisition spree. Deals include the 2010 tie-up with Co-op Travel, which gave it a total of 1,200 high street outlets, even as customers were increasingly buying their holidays online.It narrowly escaped administration in 2011 and had to be rescued by its lenders, leading to even higher debts, that have since racked up £1.3bn in interest payments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd6bd405e3cf1dcda6fb6fc9ecac56c5e418cfc9/0_127_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7141e88fe9e9e8c6b9488d06a6e921a8","title":"you give don a voice couriers widow praises ken loach film sorry we missed you ","story":"Gig economy film Sorry We Missed You is partly inspired by the death of Ruth Lane’s husbandThere is a scene in Sorry We Missed You, Ken Loach’s new film about a parcel courier driven to the brink by his brutal gig economy job, when his wife finally loses patience with his ruthless depot controller and screams at him to give her disintegrating husband a break.“Isn’t that funny,” whispered Ruth Lane as she watched the first UK public screening on Sunday night in Brighton. “I went into the depot office and shouted at Don’s manager, complaining that he didn’t have time to eat. I said you are bloody killing him. You are working him so hard.”Don Lane, a courier for DPD, which delivers for retailers including Next and Asos, was Ruth’s husband who collapsed and died aged 53 in January 2018 after working through illness in the Christmas delivery rush. His story has partly inspired Loach’s follow up to I, Daniel Blake, which goes on general release on 1 November, and now his widow was having the “surreal” experience of seeing her own life’s tragic events played out on the big screen at the Brighton Odeon on the fringes of the Labour party conference.Don Lane had skipped several hospital appointments to treat his type 1 diabetes because he had been charged £150 by DPD when he missed deliveries to attend an appointment and feared further charges. He collapsed twice while working, including once at the wheel, and was ill and vomiting blood before he died but did not take time off. Ruth Lane is now mounting a legal challenge against the company, which made a £121m profit in 2017 and paid its top executive a salary close to £1m. It is contesting her claims that he should have been treated as a worker with holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage, and that its decision to charge him for missing work to attend hospital was disability discrimination.The parallels between fact and fiction came thick and fast for Lane in a film that tackles the emotional and social impact of the shift of financial risk on to workers in the rapidly growing gig economy, which involves 4.7 million people in Britain doing jobs including delivering parcels, caring for sick and elderly people, or driving minicabs.As Loach’s hero Ricky, a father of two in Newcastle, nodded off at the wheel or raced to deliver parcels in strict one-hour windows for the fictional company PDF (Parcels Delivered Fast), Lane sighed. “Don got breached for being three minutes late on one of those,” she said, as Ricky was rebuked again for missing a “precise”.When the fictional Ricky insisted on doing his round despite being battered and bruised after a robbery from his van, which the depot boss – “the patron saint of nasty bastards” – says will cost him over £1,000, Lane wonders what her husband was going through in the days before he died. After the film, when the screenwriter Paul Laverty told the audience about Don’s story, her eyes filled with tears.Lane found her husband collapsed in the living room of their cottage and she and their 23-year-old son, Jordon, went with him in an ambulance to hospital, but to no avail.“I think we should remember there are much worse cases than Ricky’s story,” said Laverty.“It’s surreal,” said Lane, who works at a Marks \u0026amp Spencer in Bournemouth. “People at work say: ‘What did you do at the weekend?’ I’ve gone to a screening of a film partly based on my husband’s death.”“You give Don a voice and it’s blowing me away,” she told Laverty, whose research partly followed the ’s reporting of the impact of the gig economy. “If he had had his treatment he would have been here.”“It’s out of respect,” said Laverty. “It is something that shouldn’t have happened.”Lane was not the only person with personal experience of the pernicious effects of companies’ rising use of self-employed contractors. Max Dewhurst, a cycle courier and trade union activist in London, reflected that the film was “like watching a documentary”.“I know families being torn apart and the impact it has on their children, people falling asleep at the wheel, people being beaten up for their parcels.”The film’s events are less catastrophic than Don Lane’s story, depicting the impact of a business’s remorseless quest for profit on a person’s fragile family life and mental health.As Ruth Lane said, a film rendition of her husband’s story might not seem believable his death would perhaps come across melodramatic. It was a view echoed by Laverty. While the film tackles the emotional turmoil of gig economy work, it leaves hanging the question of what the ultimate consequences might be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3470d5b6805ed6557812cd94e46d2a849d8c9ef9/0_299_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98daf535b0bcd6e99d32a04573e2a181","title":"the guardian view on jeremy corbyns labour time to come together","story":"Jeremy Corbyn is cherished by many delegates in his party. He is not held in awe by them. The membership has twice backed Mr Corbyn overwhelmingly as leader despite their views being far more pro-Europe than his own. On the conference floor in Brighton on Tuesday they did so again, putting their trust in Mr Corbyn over their affection for the European Union. It is a sign of his grip on the party that the margin of his victory was so large that the conference votes on Labour’s Brexit policy did not need to be counted. Mr Corbyn’s policy appears smart: it aims to bridge the ide between leavers and remainers by offering them a final say on Brexit in a plebiscite. The trouble is that it is also too clever to sell easily on the doorstep. It is hard to see a pithy way to explain to weary voters how Labour will win an election, get a new deal, decide whether as a party to back it and then get a referendum to offer voters the option of either leaving on Labour’s terms or remaining in the EU. This is an issue of political signalling and sloganeering that Mr Corbyn must urgently solve.The Labour leader’s policy is not completely satisfactory. Referendums, as our bitter experience has shown us, can be isive, their campaigns studded with lies and open to manipulation by hidden interests. Mr Corbyn says he is offering voters the final right to decide. The Labour leader wants to emulate Harold Wilson’s approach in winning the referendum on British membership of the Common Market in 1975. Mr Wilson was criticised for offering his party an “agreement to differ”, but this strategy was successful. As Mr Wilson said, it “fulfilled my very confident prediction at the time … that the party would come out of that campaign not weaker but stronger, not ided but more united”.As his victory on the conference floor suggests, Mr Corbyn is more wily and ambitious than his critics might believe. The question is whether he is winning the battle for the hearts and minds of his party – or simply marginalising his opponents through subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, changes to the party machinery and rules. This can in part be answered by the fact that for all the claims of civil war in the party, Monday’s debate was a spirited one in which delegates on both sides of the argument engaged with each other on civil terms. The trade union vote split and pro-EU constituency delegates from the left and right worked together with some potency, though not enough to defeat Mr Corbyn’s surprisingly disciplined party management. The vote represents the decision of the Labour party and the labour movement. It has the virtue of allowing MPs to run as remain candidates in remain constituencies and leave candidates in leave constituencies at the next election."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47ffa5fec131aed0b67ca37cb6934cadb6c11efa/0_0_4161_2497/master/4161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ed6463a6b477b0e1caff0f35ddf2e9a","title":"the guardian view on thomas cook wiped out by debt","story":"The collapse of Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest holiday company, is most obviously a disaster for its 21,000 European employees – 9,000 of whom work in the UK. It may also prove fatal for some of the hotels and other businesses that relied on it for customers. And while having a holiday ruined is not as bad as losing a job, the inconvenience faced by 150,000 British tourists who are now overseas should be treated seriously. Holidays are important, particularly when planned to mark milestones such as marriages and retirements.The demise of yet another big high street name is bad news too for all those who rely on town centres for their livelihoods, shopping or recreation. The closure of around 560 shops will create yet more empty windows in places already struggling to retain a sense of commercial life as retail migrates online. Jumps in the share price of easyJet and Tui, Thomas Cook’s main competitor, indicate that shareholders believe reduced competition will increase their profits. As with the collapse of Monarch Airlines in 2017, this week’s events are likely to lead to price rises – making the 178-year-old firm’s disappearance a blow to bargain-seeking travellers too.It is far from clear that the bailout of up to £250m that the company requested, and ministers refused, would have avoided all this. Thomas Cook almost went bust in 2011 and is colossally in debt due to decisions taken by management teams dating back to its merger with MyTravel in 2007. The 2018 heatwave, which led to reduced bookings, combined with the weakness of sterling and concerns about Brexit, pushed it over the edge. And while a consultation with the workforce, as proposed by Labour’s John McDonnell, would indeed have been preferable to the shock and disruption of the last 24 hours, there was a risk that even the bailout would not have been enough. With the cost of the operation to bring stranded tourists home and pay Thomas Cook’s bills expected to far exceed the initial estimate of £100m, the risk of pouring public money into the company, only to see it fail anyway, was that taxpayers would have been landed with two bills instead of one.Ministers must explain their decision in light of reports that the Spanish and Turkish governments were considering a rescue before they pulled the plug. But political arguments over the role of the state must not overshadow the fact that this is a private-sector failure. The gulf iding bosses from workers in a business where bosses have taken home £30m since 2007 appears particularly obscene when it is clear that opportunities to reduce its debt mountain were missed as recently as last year.Observers, as well as those directly affected, may take some solace in the repatriation operation led by the Civil Aviation Authority. That logistical challenges such as ferrying 150,000 tourists back to the UK can be met is a relief. But the whole miserable episode also serves as a reminder of the perils that await. The weakness of sterling combined with Brexit uncertainty, as well as changing weather patterns and other factors outside ministers’ control, place companies at risk. As political instability looks set to continue, the government must come up with clear criteria against which future bids for state help from collapsing businesses can be judged."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/712f579711ee2fedee8c5fffdacf009f57eab7e2/0_16_2161_1297/master/2161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=826ee3b7d12686c59d996e2b679f8c0c","title":"the referendum was not david camerons biggest mistake","story":"George Osborne wants to rewrite history and pretend everything was fine until the vote. Tell that to the people whose lives were shattered by austerityI could not take the sentimental send-off David Cameron got from the House of Commons when he resigned, and said so at the time. History was immediately being rewritten when it came to this man who had just made the mistake of having an unnecessary referendum. Poor chap. Sorry, but this is just not the case. Cameron’s self-belief deluded others into thinking that he stood for something other than himself.He was ruthless, and his shininess hid the reality of what his ministers were doing: what his chancellor George Osborne, for instance, unleashed on ordinary people. The decimation of the public sector, the deliberate impoverishment of the already poor was a national disaster. It still is.But not according to one George Osborne, who reviewed his mate Cameron’s book in a newspaper he now edits. Osborne described the pair helplessly witnessing the referendum result – “an event that destroys our careers, wrecks our political project and (much more importantly) ends an era of political stability and rationality”.Their careers were not destroyed they failed upwards. The national disaster had already happened and, in fact, fed into Brexit – the poisonous discourse whereby the poor are blamed for the sins of the rich was an ideological choice. Cameron and Osborne were finishing the Thatcherite policy of shrinking the state. Even the International Monetary Fund at the time warned about the repercussions of such austerity.This rewriting of the recent past – the pretence that everything was going fine until the Tories gave in to their headbangers – is wrong. Cameron’s one modernising move, equal marriage, cost nothing. That was the whole point.Osborne asks us to feel sorry for Cameron, who suffers for his innocent mistake. David is “distraught by what happened to the Britain he cared about”. So am I, but it’s the Britain in which we step over bodies in sleeping bags, the one that he is partly responsible for, that I care about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea17a7aefe0ee7bbc5a3dc04bd68be7464a3dbec/1255_0_4745_2847/master/4745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1690c14abcc1401d9ea89b4512305f7","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of bored","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘bored’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘bored’.Share your photos of what bored means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 25 September at 10am.

But students currently enrolled will miss outInternational students at British universities fear the government’s plan to offer two-year post-study work visas to future students could leave them worse off if the extra time is not given to them too.Last week the government said foreign students will be offered a two-year work visa after graduating from a British university. But the new policy will only apply to those graduating from summer 2021, according to the announcement.The current immigration policy, controversially put in place by Theresa May in 2012, gives students just four months to find work after graduating.Over 16,000 people have already signed a petition calling on the government to extend the new visa rules to international students currently studying in the UK.The petition states: “There are thousands of international students currently studying in the UK and gaining valuable skills. spoke to current international students about their concerns:Umair Qamar, from Pakistan, recently graduated from De Montfort University with a master’s in cyber security. He wants to find a job before his visa runs out.“I’ve been applying for jobs since I came to this country. It’s been a difficult and disappointing experience. I’ve lost count of how many positions I’ve applied for, but my CV is all over the UK. I’ve had lots of rejections because the company didn’t want to sponsor students. It’s almost impossible for international students to get jobs at the moment. But I’m still trying.“I’m happy to hear other students will get the two year visa. But I want to point out that it would benefit the government to extend the deadline for current students, too. We are very dedicated and work hard. The recent change means there is hope.”Muhammad Junaid Asif Sahi, from Pakistan, is doing a master’s in transport planning and engineering at Edinburgh Napier University.“The current four-month bracket for students is a mere formality and a bureaucratic way of saying, ‘get the degree and go back home’, because companies want someone they can hire without hassle.“I’d like to stay in the UK but I don’t know if I’ll be able to. It’s all so confusing. Some reports say students graduating in 2020 will get the extension, but others say you have to graduate in 2021, so I don’t know who will be affected. This makes me feel nervous about my future. If the UK government has decided to let international students stay longer, why wait a couple of years to implement it?”Hassan Sheikh did an undergraduate degree at the University of Manchester and is due to begin a master’s this year.“We’ve been told the extension applies to students graduating in 2021 and after and it’s unclear whether it will apply to those graduating in 2020. If it doesn’t apply to those of us graduating then, I worry employers will wait a year to hire international students so they don’t need to deal with the hassle of sponsoring visas. In that sense I think current students like me could now be worse off than before the announcement was made. Because it just puts us in the middle of nowhere.”Jessica Martins, from Brazil, has just handed in her dissertation for her master’s in corporate communications, marketing and public relations at the University of Leeds. Her visa is due to run out in January.“I think the extension should also be available for people who are currently here. I’m happy new students will have the opportunity to stay longer. But it’s also frustrating for me, because I would have liked to stay too. I don’t regret coming to the UK, but I spent a lot of money and I’m not sure whether my degree will help me to get jobs back home if I don’t have work experience. If I’d known this would happen, I would have waited two more years to come to the UK.”Laura*, from the US, graduated from King’s College, London with a master’s in European politics in 2018. She was forced to leave the UK four months later after being unable to find work before the deadline.“Leaving the UK was the worst day of my life. I ended up on the floor of Gatwick, sobbing. I couldn’t stand up because I was crying so hard. I had made a home, I had a boyfriend, I had a social circle, then I had to leave. When I got back to America, I was depressed and suicidal.“Both my degrees focused on UKEU relations and I got a distinction for my dissertation, which was on Brexit. I feel my qualifications could be useful to British employers as the country prepares to leave the EU. But I sent over 100 applications and companies told me it was too risky to hire foreigners.“As angry as I am, I want to go back to the UK because I’m now in professional limbo. The hostile environment has to end some time and this is a welcome first step. When I heard the announcement it was the first time in my life that I cried from happiness. For the first time I feel there’s a chance I could get my life back again.”Riddi Viswanathan, from India, is a former international student and International Student Officer at the University of Manchester and now works for the university.“I’ve been fighting for this extension for five years, so I’m delighted to hear the government has made a U-turn. The current four months isn’t long enough and puts enormous pressure on people. I’ve seen students struggle, staying up all night to do their dissertation just so they can apply for jobs during the day. I graduated a year ago and many companies rejected me because they didn’t want to sponsor my tier two visa. I became involved in politics specifically to change this.“But I’m afraid the good news will undermine other challenges international students face. Tuition fees, already high for international students, could rise further for those from the EU. There’s no certainty around the settlement scheme, EU funding, or the future of Erasmus after Brexit. While for non-EU students, the cost of getting a visa has risen, along with the immigration health surcharge. It also doesn’t help current students, who feel stuck in the middle. And so extending the post-study work visa is one good step, but it’s not the end for international students.”* Laura’s surname has been omitted at her request."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90343c734a633b9b66732dfe1f532e36a8a40e46/0_131_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce10693f725bb142c1d4e8c636a823b4","title":"greta thunberg speech un 2019 address","story":"Greta Thunberg has excoriated world leaders for their “betrayal” of young people through their inertia over the climate crisis at a United Nations summit that failed to deliver ambitious new commitments to address dangerous global heating.In a stinging speech on Monday, the teenage Swedish climate activist told governments that “you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal.”Days after millions of young people joined protests worldwide to demand emergency action on climate change, leaders gathered for the annual United Nations general assembly aiming to inject fresh momentum into efforts to curb carbon emissions.But Thunberg predicted the summit would not deliver any new plans in line with the radical cuts in greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are needed to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown.“You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,” a visibly emotional Thunberg said.“The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line.”As the summit spooled through about 60 speeches from national representatives, it became clear that Thunberg’s forecast was prescient. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, told delegates that “the time for talking is over” in announcing a plan to ramp up renewable energy but didn’t announce any phase-out of coal – a key goal set by António Guterres, the UN secretary-general who convened the summit.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did set out the end of coalmining in her country but only by 2038 – a lengthy timeframe that disappointed environmentalists.Meanwhile, China declined to put forward any new measures to tackle the climate crisis.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, called for the European Union to deepen its emissions cuts and said that France would not make trade deals with countries not signed up tor the landmark Paris climate agreement. “We cannot allow our youth to strike every Friday without action,” Macron said, in reference to Friday’s global climate strikes.Despite Guterres’ efforts, the summit was somewhat overshadowed by its absentees – most notably the US, and Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil, whose representatives were reportedly not selected to make a presentation there because of Brazil’s failure to outline plans to strengthen its efforts to counter climate change.Donald Trump did visit the UN on Monday but only briefly dipped into the climate summit to see Modi’s speech before attending a meeting which he had called on religious freedom.As he arrived at the UN, Trump crossed paths with Thunberg, who fixed the president with a hard stare.The summit was designed to accelerate countries’ ambition to address the climate crisis amid increasingly urgent warnings by scientists. A new UN analysis has found that commitments to cut planet-warming gases must be at least tripled and increased by up to fivefold if the world is to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement of holding the temperature rise to at least 2C above the pre-industrial era.The world is currently on track to warm by as much as 3.4C by the end of the century, the UN warned, a situation that would escalate disastrous heatwaves, flooding, droughts and societal unrest. Major coral reefs and many other species face extinction.“There’s a big dissonance between every leader saying to Greta ‘we hear you’ and the commitments they are putting on to the table,” said Isabel Cavelier, a former climate negotiator for Colombia who is now senior adviser at the Mission 2020 climate group. “China said absolutely nothing new, India mentioned commitments made in the past, the US, Canada and Australia aren’t here. We are seeing governments showing up empty-handed. There’s a feeling that the big emitters are holding things back.”There were a few signs of progress. A group of nearly 90 large companies promised to reach net zero emissions by 2050, while a handful of countries said they will be winding down coal use. But it became apparent that most of the ambition was coming from developing countries, rather than the major polluters.Trump has vowed to pull the US out of the Paris agreement, while other major powers are wary of making further commitments ahead of key UN climate talks in Glasgow next year.Thunberg’s speech was “very emotional and grounded in science”, said Alden Meyer, director of strategy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “If I were a world leader I’d feel very uncomfortable. But we’ve seen nothing from the big national leaders, the G20 players. It’s hard to say the summit moved the needle on the emissions curve.”“Other countries must follow our lead,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, a country situated on coral atolls in the Pacific that is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. “Falling short will represent the greatest failure humanity has ever seen. The summit must be the moment we choose survival over selfishness.”But delegates at the summit warned that the international effort to stave off dangerous global heating was being undermined by a wave of nationalism. “If you look at the US and Brazil, it’s a result of populist politics that is turning its back on the climate,” said Cavelier. “That needs to be made explicit and isolated from the world.”Amid the stunning rise of the youth climate movement, Thunberg, who arrived in the US last month on a solar-powered yacht, has directly castigated Congress and leaders at the UN, as well as spearhead the largest ever climate protest last week.On Monday she joined 14 other children to lodge a formal complaint under the UN convention on the rights of the child.The complainants, from countries including Argentina, the Marshall Islands, France, Germany and the US, claim that countries’ failure to address the climate crisis violates the international convention. “Each one of us had our rights violated and denied, our futures are being destroyed,” said Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old from New York who has taken to protesting outside the UN headquarters every Friday.Thunberg said that world leaders were endangering children by ignoring climate breakdown. “They promised to protect the rights of the child and they have not done this,” she said at a media conference at the offices of Unicef. “The message is that we have had enough.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4939e9f0947c763b6878db24f9161558aa7b4ba6/0_178_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6099f14c0cd57209e74b48c31c84536","title":"salmonella alert issued after 100 people infected by uk eggs in three years","story":"Warning follows joint investigation that uncovered hundreds of regulation breaches by farms, packing stations and wholesalers The government has issued a salmonella warning after an investigation revealed that at least 100 people had been poisoned by British eggs in three years.On Saturday, following the joint investigation, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) issued a food alert, warning consumers that eggs from a specific English flock could be contaminated with salmonella. The eggs in question were marked with the British Lion stamp, which is supposed to guarantee they are safe.Salmonella can cause food poisoning, and in the most severe cases can be fatal. There have been no deaths in this outbreak. Previously the FSA had insisted British Lion eggs were safe to eat raw, even for pregnant women, children and the elderly. It has now emerged that regulations designed to ensure high standards in the UK egg sector were breached several thousand times by farms, packing stations and wholesalers over the last three years, according to records seen by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the . Inspection records have shown that more than a hundred tests for salmonella had been missed, or carried out too late, increasing the chance of contaminated eggs entering the food chain.Over three years egg farms in England had more than 100 breaches of the rules around the government’s programme to prevent salmonella.Some offending farms were issued with penalty notices, which can result in a fine or other enforcement action.The records – compiled by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) – also show that one in six of all inspections carried out in the past three years found infractions on issues including hygiene, animal welfare and egg quality.Ensuring farms are regularly cleaned and disinfected, alongside strict pest control and biosecurity measures, is key to preventing salmonella, which can be spread by contaminated wild birds and animals, in water, and via farm workers.A single lapse in hygiene could introduce salmonella on to a farm or enable the pathogens to spread, industry sources have said.Last week an investigation revealed how a major outbreak of one of the worst strains of salmonella had affected several farms and two egg-packing factories, including one that supplies major supermarkets.More than 50 egg-laying flocks were found to have tested positive for salmonella since January 2018, 11 of them contaminated with the most serious strains of the bacteria. Egg-packing factories were also found contaminated on five occasions in the period.Almost all of the 13bn eggs eaten in the UK come from British farms. More than half of the market comes from free-range hens, while most of the rest is from birds in “enriched cages” – indoor enclosures for dozens of birds with perching spaces and scratching areas.The salmonella outbreak revealed by the Bureau is understood to have affected some free-range egg farms.The government confirmed on Friday that it was “investigating and taking action” to control the outbreak along with industry and local authorities. In its food alert the FSA said there was a “potential but low risk of illness” and advised people to cook their eggs thoroughly to eliminate the bug.A spokesperson for the APHA said: “All egg producers are subject to rigorous and regular inspections to ensure standards are being met and to minimise the risk to public health. If any producers are found to have hygiene breaches or fail to carry out salmonella testing, we will not hesitate to take action to bring them into compliance with our strict regulations. We prevent producers selling whole table eggs if their flocks are confirmed to have regulated strains of salmonella which endanger human health.”Responding to the revelations, Professor Erik Millstone, a food safety expert at Sussex University, said: “If 100 cases of salmonella poisoning from UK eggs has not been sufficient to withdraw the advice that UK produced eggs can safely be eaten raw, how many will be enough? How many people will need to get sick before the advice will be changed?”Kerry McCarthy, a Labour MP, said the investigation served as an “urgent warning” to the poultry industry, government and consumers to avoid complacency. “While progress has been made on controlling salmonella in eggs … one case is a case too many.” contacted the British Egg Council for comment but received no reply.Hygiene on farms and food safety for consumers are sensitive issues for the government at present, as difficulties over checks on livestock and farm produce are a major factor in Brexit negotiations over the Irish border, while consumers and farmers are concerned that looser trade rules after Brexit may result in imports of food from farms with lower animal welfare or hygiene standards from overseas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da7a452de9bf95f65c4fca9c2ab4d90ff479152d/0_151_4565_2741/master/4565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9064e8adc6168a1ccf78c374b5ac1260","title":"milan fashion week springsummer 2020 14 key shows in pictures","story":"From J-Lo and Donatella Versace breaking the internet, to Prada favouring timeless style over fashion, the Italian capital had plenty of memorable moments this season "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44c85845ea0d39fdfbcedec8fbe1b5092def5e5f/0_3382_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6644ed7cb3667c84420d4e5fa81c98f6","title":"observer food monthly 20 best easy autumn recipes","story":"Anna Jones’s apple and pear crisp and Claudia Roden’s tagliatelle – our favourite recipes for when the nights draw inOf an occasional Sunday evening, Dad would make the most delicious mushrooms on toast. Well, actually, he didn’t make toast rather, he would make the most delicious, perfect squares of immaculately fried bread. It seems obvious when you think about it, for however well-toasted is a slice of bread – even the most accommodating of crusty sourdough – it will, inevitably, begin to slightly sog about halfway through munching. But a nicely thick slice of fried bread will hold its own until the last mouthful. Always the thoughtful and considered cook, my dear old dad.His mother, not the most inspired, kitchen-wise, would have simply opened a can of Chesswood creamed mushrooms and warmed them through on the Aga. Bbut she did fry the bread. . … though possibly not as well as did her son. His trick was to lightly spread each surface with a smear of good dripping, then fry it on each side in a dry frying pan until super-crisp. His mushrooms were always button, cut in half, stewed in butter, a dusting of flour added and then milk stirred in until a smooth, thick-ish sauce was achieved if there was some cream (or top-of-milk) in the fridge, a spoonful or two of that to finish. I have always believed he wanted to recreate that can of Chesswood’s but simply because our mother would never have countenanced such slovenly convenience, he made them his own.Shall we upgrade a little?

Lift out with a slotted spoon into a small saucepan, pop in the butter and add a little seasoning. Put to cook over a very low light, stirring together until the butter has melted and allow to stew for about 10 minutes, covered, really slowly.Sparsely spread the white bread with duck fat (or butter) and quietly fry on each side until golden and crisp.Strain the morel-soaking liquid, using a tea strainer, into another small saucepan and add the sherry, vermouth, shallot and garlic. Simmer until reduced by about two-thirds.Add the flour to the morels, stir around for a minute or 2, then strain in the reduced morel liquor. Simmer till thickened, then stir in the cream.

Toss them with the maple syrup in a roasting tray and cover the tray with foil. Roast for 15 minutes in the hot oven, then remove the foil and roast for a further 10 minutes until the edges catch and caramelise.Meanwhile, roughly chop 50g of the prunes and all the figs, finely chop the ginger, and place the whole lot into the bottom of a 24cm round (or equivalently sized) baking dish.

It will feel wetter than a crumble topping and you’ll be left with larger pieces of butter, but you should have a very rough crumbly dough after about 4 minutes. Chop the remaining prunes roughly and mix them through too.When your apples are ready, mix them with the fruit and spices in the baking dish, then sprinkle over the topping.

The Piedmontese white truffles are the most prized and extremely expensive. They must be used very fresh as they lose their aroma at an accelerating pace – their season is between the end of September and mid January – or preserved in jars or tins, which are not quite as scented as fresh ones.Serves 4white truffle 1 small unsalted butter 125gparmesan 40g, grated salt and freshly ground black peppernutmeg a grating tagliatelle 300g, or fettuccineTruffles are generally exported already cleaned. If you need to clean your white truffle, scrub it with a stiff brush and rub it with a moist cloth. Melt the butter and add the grated parmesan and a little salt, pepper and nutmeg. Boil the tagliatelle or fettuccine until al dente, drain quickly and serve immediately, tossed with the melted butter mixture. Shave a little white truffle over each serving with a mandolin or a potato peeler.Variation Black summer truffles from Umbria are relatively cheap – you can buy them fresh in season from October to March – and they are available preserved in jars in some British supermarkets. Their flavour is not as sensational as that of white truffles but it is distinctive and delicate. For 2 small portions of Umbrian tagliatelle con tartufi nerri, cook 100g tagliatelle and prepare the sauce at the same time: bring to the boil 200ml double cream with a few drops of truffle oil (to taste), 2 tablespoons freshly grated parmesan, a little salt and a finely grated small black truffle. When the tagliatelle are al dente, drain and mix them in the pan with the truffle sauce.From The Food of Italy by Claudia Roden (Square Peg, £30)Za’atar is a Palestinian spice mix made from wild thyme, sesame and sumac that has an affinity with sweet root vegetables. Here it is used to make crunchy, tangy croutons to adorn an aromatic soup of roasted butternut squash and spiced lentils. Roasting the squash intensifies its flavour and sweetness, and gives the soup a glorious silky texture that perfectly contrasts with the crispy croutons.Serves 4butternut squash 1kg, peeled, deseeded and cut into 3cm pieceslight olive oilonions 2, finely choppedgarlic 4 cloves, crushedcumin seeds ¾ tsp coriander seeds ¾ tsp ground cinnamon ½ tsp red lentils 160g, rinsedvegetable or chicken stock 750ml lemon juice of ½sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the toppingsstale bread 2 slices (I like to use sourdough for taste and texture)za’atar 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oilparsley or coriander leaves choppedPreheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Place the butternut squash on a baking tray and drizzle with light olive oil. Toss the chunks so they are evenly coated in the oil, then roast for 20-30 minutes, until they are soft.Heat 3 tablespoons light olive oil in a large saucepan, add the onions and fry for 10 minutes over a medium heat. Add the garlic, reduce the heat and cook for another few minutes.Meanwhile, toast the cumin and coriander seeds by stirring them in a dry pan over a low heat for a minute until their aromas are released. Grind the seeds in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder, then add them and the cinnamon to the saucepan with the softened onions. Fry the spices for a few minutes.Add the lentils and 1 litre of just-boiled water. Cover and simmer the soup for 10 minutes.Once the lentils have softened, add the squash, stock, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Leave to simmer for another 10 minutes.Once the lentils are fully cooked, take the pan off the heat and blend the soup with a hand-held blender. Taste and adjust the seasoning to your preference.To make the croutons, roughly chop the bread into 3cm chunks.

The second was to fall flat on his face. He had been on the pitch for 54 seconds and as he lay on the grass, the soundtrack provided by a bloke with a swanee whistle and a set of cymbals, he watched the men in red and white run beyond him and a familiar scene unfold. It was happening again, only faster. At Athletic Bilbao on the opening night, Barcelona had gone behind in the 89th minute against Betis a week later, it was the 17th and at Osasuna, the sixth.This time, in week five at Granada, they had only just made it to the second when Ramon Azeez scored. This time, they wouldn’t make it out of trouble. As for Junior, signed from Real Betis for €18m in the summer, he didn’t make it out for the second half. Lionel Messi did, at last making his first league appearance of the season, and so did Ansu Fati, their hope at 16. Even they couldn’t salvage anything from this wreckage. Arturo Vidal came on too. Pretty much the first thing he did was boot the ball off. The second was stick a hand out in the area. From the penalty spot, Álvaro Vadillo made it 2-0. It was all over. And, it was tempting to conclude, even this early, all might actually mean all. Barcelona had been beaten. Barcelona are beaten, it seems.On the night when Granada, with a budget that couldn’t pay Messi let alone everyone else at the Camp Nou, their salary cap 18 times lower than Barcelona’s, deservedly won 2-0, the story should have been about them. What they had done was, in their manager’s too-literally-translated words, “barbaric”. It should have been about how 11 of their players on Saturday were in the second ision while Barcelona won the league last season. About how they have lost just once, against Sevilla on their first home game back in primera, and won three in a row since without conceding. It should have been about how victory momentarily took them top. Granada. Top. But it wasn’t. And not just because Diego Martínez, their manager, insisted that looking at the league was a “waste of time”. Or even because the story almost never is about them when it can be about them.It was because there was something about the way Barcelona were defeated, the way it managed to shock and not shock at all, that ran deeper. This wasn’t just one game, and certainly wasn’t just two men – still less Junior or Vidal, or even just Ernesto Valverde – however bad it had been. And, boy, had it been bad. It was difficult to remember a performance worse than this, and yet there was no lack of contenders.This was sudden it was also a long time coming. Dreadful in defence, in midfield, up front. Nothing worked. “Not even with Messi,” ran the cover of AS, and there was something telling in that too. On Friday morning, El Mundo Deportivo gleefully splashed on Real Madrid in crisis. By the following night, it was Barcelona who were. And by the night after, Madrid were top.“This Barcelona lies in ruins,” AS’s headline ran. “Another disaster,” El Mundo Deportivo said. At the end, Frenkie De Jong approached the fans and apologised. He must have wondered where he had ended up. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. “For Barcelona, every stadium is Anfield now,” wrote Santi Giménez. “They are a drama of epic proportions, where anyone can strip them bare with startling ease.” Something broke that night. Or maybe it’s more accurate to suggest that something was revealed, and has not been remedied.They carried on regardless, reluctant to challenge the old order. But once it had happened it was more likely to happen again, a recurring nightmare. Rome resurfaced in Liverpool, and Liverpool resurfaces anywhere: Bilbao, Pamplona, Granada, Dortmund. The Camp Nou is one thing but Barcelona haven’t won away since April. “I am responsible,” Valverde said. He meant for Saturday night but there’s more. It is early, but it is their worst start in 25 years, and for all the coincidences – injuries, penalties, daft inidual mistakes – it isn’t entirely coincidental. They’ve trailed in four of their five games and conceded in all of them. No one in La Liga has conceded more goals.And this is more than that old, facile line about how Barcelona can’t defend: they can’t attack either. At Granada, they had one shot on target. Sure, they have been without Messi, Suárez, Dembélé, Neymar too, but it’s not about that either it’s about the most basic thing of all, the essence of Barcelona, perhaps hidden behind Messi for too long: the play. Against Liverpool, there was something deeper than defeat. That this is a team losing its religion is an old debate, politicised and exaggerated: Barcelona have been the best team in Spain by miles over the last two years. For all the flaws, Anfield remains hard to explain. Nor were they as heretical, as un-Barça as some accusations had it. But there is something in it, in the lack of a structure, an idea, a commitment to an identity.It has been hard to avoid the feeling that too few of those that mattered, manager included, believed in the model. Slowly, football slipped from them. Xavi and Iniesta have gone. Messi is too often the team – a process in which he may not be entirely blameless – and one day, he will be gone too. That has created a kind of desperation. After the defeat in Liverpool, Valverde’s time appeared to have come to a close, but it didn’t. It is hard to see how you can recover from a moment like that. There’s a feeling this is a season too far – two seasons too far, some critics insist. There are parallels to Guardiola’s fourth season and Luis Enrique’s third. Defeat brought opportunity, a chance to reset.But they carried on Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president, backed Valverde and some players did too: they were comfortable. Too comfortable. Valverde stands accused of allowing it. The decline went largely unchallenged. It is not that Barcelona are bad so much as that they’re nothing in particular. De Jong came, someone to reinforce the model, but not always in his place: he has played too wide or not at all. The men alongside him have changed. There have been five different lineups in six weeks.Antoine Griezmann arrived, a year late. He has two positions: one is Messi’s, the other is Suárez’s. The welcome was cold those two wanted Neymar instead. Barcelona pursued the Brazilian publicly, driven by the president. They didn’t sign him, but he cost them. The players who wanted him weren’t happy, Messi among them, and the players that didn’t weren’t either. Asked how sick of it he was on a scale of one to 10, Valverde said 9.5.Barcelona offered PSG players in part-exchange, but didn’t tell the players that. One was Ousmane Dembélé, another was Philippe Coutinho before he was loaned to Bayern Munich. The attempt to sell the players they bought to replace Neymar, at a cost greater than his, to buy the Brazilian back again was the perfect portrait of the whole sorry story.The sporting directors have rotated as much as the players, the latest happily heading off to Paris to chase a player he couldn’t get. Meanwhile, the players flew east then west, preseason trumping the actual season. Then they came back and lost in Bilbao, which turned out to be just the start. Firpo fell down within a minute on his debut. The rest of them had been falling for far longer. “We have a long, hard season ahead of us,” Luis Suárez said on Saturday night, and he meant it.• Zinedine Zidane did something even he hadn’t done before: he took Real Madrid to the Sánchez Pizjuán and won. The last time they won 1-0 there, he was playing. It wasn’t sparkling, but it didn’t have to be they just needed the victory and Zidane, under pressure, needed it most of all. “A lot’s been said,” the Frenchman noted. Now it was his turn and he kept returning to the same word: solidaridad. Whether it will work elsewhere is a different matter. As Jorge Valdano put it on Sunday night: “What Madrid did today they can’t keep doing: Hazard, Bale and James will have to go forward, not defend at the back.”• “Agua, agua.” Kieran Trippier needed a drink, so someone in the south end threw him a bottle. He took a swig and threw it back. A thumbs up and there was applause. Atlético’s fans have really taken to him. Trippier has provided more deliveries into the box than anyone else in the Atlético side, but this time it was not enough: they couldn’t find a way past Celta.• “Peter Lim, go home” read the banner at Mestalla, where a 1-1 draw was played out to protests against the owner. At one point, fans chanted the name of sacked manager Marcelino. Rodrigo wagged his finger he loved Marcelino more than anyone, but now was the time to get behind the new coach, he explained afterwards. When the supporters chanted his name instead, he applauded.• Athletic are top for the first time since the opening day of 2005-06. Unbeaten, only one goal conceded in five, they’re now unbeaten in 17 at home and this is their best start in 25 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eb9d92acfbca89d955720e148836bef33a97e45/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5b272438086f803d9671d2ada5ed1ba","title":"untitled goose game review a honking good time","story":"PC, Switch Panic IncHouse HousePlaying the role of a loud, waddling waterfowl trying to disrupt village life isn’t rocket science, but this puzzle-stealth hybrid is a delightIf you break Untitled Goose Game (which, for the purposes of this review is the game’s title, never mind that it is clearly not untitled) down to its base elements, you might describe it as a puzzle-stealth hybrid, a kind of bird-based Metal Gear Solid where you must accomplish small tasks while remaining undetected. This fails, however, to describe the true joy of Untitled Goose Game, which is simply this: you are an annoying goose.That detail, that context, changes Goose Game from a merely competent brain-teaser into something far more coherent and fulfilling. Where most stealth games deal in the stark intensities of violence and death, Goose Game instead lowers the stakes back into the realm of comedy and slapstick, and comes off all the better for it.As a goose, your goal is quite naturally to cause mischief and chaos around a quintessential English village by completing a to-do list of vaguely defined tasks, gradually unlocking access to more and more of the town as you go. The puzzle element largely comes from figuring out how to accomplish these goals (well, pranks) within the bounds of the game’s clockwork world, by eliciting varying reactions from villagers to your avian antics.You might notice, for instance, that the gardener bends his head to the earth when he replants some prized object, at which point you can nick his cap and make off with it – a crucial component to getting him to “wear his sun hat” instead. It’s not exactly rocket science, but it’s nonetheless superbly satisfying to work out how, exactly, a goose is supposed to “make someone buy back their own stuff” or “be awarded a flower” with nothing more than a beak and a very loud, annoying honk.Aesthetically speaking, every element of Goose Game has seemingly been crafted to put a smile on your face. The way the Goose waddles as you strut around never fails to delight the clear, deliberate notes of an allegro in perfect comedic sync with the action on screen brings to mind classic Looney Tunes cartoons and other farces. An extremely minimalist UI and a bold, chunky art style also lends the village a lovely sense of peace and serenity, a perfect stage for your naughty waterfowl to get into all kinds of silly hijinks.Only two or three hours long, Goose Game doesn’t overstay its welcome, though there is an expanded list of small mischiefs to accomplish post-credits, if you still wish to continue terrorising the innocent. Certainly not fowl, most definitely worth a gander, it’s a whimsical little game full of charm and joy and a wonderful experience for just about anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea1229b569d94f17ec91bc9098376b64eb85039/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=258418a96d790fa23e2eea87543f7a3e","title":"cats bond with owners and are not as aloof as they seem study shows","story":"Scientists say felines display similar ‘attachment styles’ with caregivers as dogs and children – but not everyone is convincedCats may sometimes seem aloof, contrary and utterly nonplussed by humans, but it turns out that might not be the full story.Researchers say they have found that, like children and dogs, cats form emotional attachments to their caregivers including something known as “secure attachment” – a situation in which the presence of a caregiver helps them to feel secure, calm, safe and comfortable enough to explore their environment.“Despite fewer studies, research suggests we may be underestimating cats’ sociocognitive abilities,” the authors of the study write.The study, published in the journal Current Biology by researchers at Oregon State University in the US, involved owners and their kittens taking part in a simple exercise.Each owner spent two minutes with their kitten, after which they left the room for two minutes, and then returned for a two-minute reunion. The behaviour of 70 kittens was monitored throughout.A similar split in secure versus insecure attachment style was seen in 38 adult cats, and the team say such a split has also been seen in previous research involving children and dogs with their caregivers.Further experiments showed that subsequent training and socialisation of a subgroup of the kittens had little, if any, effect on attachment type. The researchers say that suggests that while such measures might influence the development of an attachment style to start with, once established such styles are pretty well stable.“This may suggest that heritable factors, such as temperament, also influence attachment style and could contribute to its stability,” they write.However, Prof Daniel Mills, an expert in veterinary behavioural medicine from the University of Lincoln who has previously studied human-cat relationships, said the research has flaws, including that the team did not explore other possible types of bonds and did not repeat their experiments with strangers. That, he said, means that the cats might have been responding more generally to social support from human presence, rather than showing attachment to a particular inidual.“At the moment, as far as we can tell, responses around the owner that look like attachment are often largely the result of previous reinforcement,” he added.While Mills added that kittens show attachment to their mother, he said it remains unclear whether they form a similar attachment to their owners.“I think cats do emotionally bond with their owners, I just don’t think that at present we have any convincing evidence that this is a form of psychological attachment in the normal psychological sense,” he said.Dr Lauren Finka from Nottingham Trent University agreed.“For species that spend a large proportion of their time in proximity to specific humans, it can be very advantageous to form bonds with them,” she said. “However, unlike children and potentially dogs, it is less probable that cats have an innate need to form strong, secure attachments to their caregiver, particularly as adults – hence signs of this are more likely rooted in factors like their personality, early socialisation and how we keep them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b357fe4a6ff8ca3247485a9fcb7c9c6bbb705af/0_218_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bca01e86a478306c3e4b92446802143","title":"how we met i told her i loved her in uzbek she had no idea what i was saying","story":"Sarah Heywood-Rakhimova, 30, and Akmal Rakhimov, 29, are actors and live in New York‘“She would come to my house to teach me English, and I would teach her Uzbek,” remembers Akmal. “But my motive,” says Sarah, “was to get as physically close as I could – so how do you turn a lesson into a date?” They ended up kissing.This wasn’t real life, but a scene they developed and performed as part of a theatre course in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 2009. Akmal was from Uzbekistan Sarah, from the US. Both had enrolled for three years at the renowned Ilkhom Theatre of Mark Weil.“Everything we felt chemically and emotionally was on stage for everyone to see,” says Sarah. “Our professor saw it, our classmates saw it. We were like, ‘We’re just kissing because it’s a sketch.’ But it was heated. It was very magnetic.”Akmal remembers her arriving at the start of the course. “She was all big eyes, in shock, just waving at everyone,” he says. He invited her for an ice-cream at the end of one day, but with neither able to communicate with the other, Sarah turned him down. “I didn’t even know how to appropriately say ‘no’,” she says. “Body language was different, gestures were different. Then the next time he asked was in December, and I said: ‘Yes’ – and that was the first spark of maybe something.”“I didn’t speak any English. I couldn’t even say ‘an ice-cream’,” says Akmal. It was awkward, says Sarah with a laugh. They spent about half an hour together, smiling at each other.She hadn’t been expecting to meet someone. “I was so focused on school I couldn’t fathom getting involved with someone. But there was something about Akmal that drew me in. He had this smouldering gaze and he was secretive, almost, very hard to read. I felt that in certain exercises he opened up and I was like: ‘How can I engage with this further?’” Akmal was similarly intrigued. “She was a person with huge freedom. Even though I didn’t understand most of the things she said, the way she spoke and communicated, she seemed like a free person, which I wanted to be.”A date to an old Soviet-era theme park in February was the moment, says Sarah, “we just knew we were connected beyond this sketch, and beyond language”. Her Russian was better by this point. “There was almost a language of our own developing,” she says. “We could intuitively understand each other, based on gazes, or touch, or a certain shift in mood.”She says she remembers not wanting the day to end. Akmal helped her with some grocery shopping, then invited her back to his place for supper. “He lived 45 minutes away and he still took me home at night. I remember getting out near the big bazaar and it was snowing and I just felt so safe for the first time in my five months there. It was a magical moment, it was like a fairytale.”One spring afternoon, she told him she loved him. He laughed – at her bad Russian, Sarah thought. “And then he said: ‘I’m laughing because I’ve told you so many times before, you just didn’t understand me. Of course I love you.’ It was a sublime moment, great joy.” “I had been telling her many times, in Uzbek,” he says. “I would talk to her and she would sit and listen, but she had no idea what I was saying. I was just talking about her eyes, her smile, and I would always say: ‘I love you.’”Sarah had promised her parents she would finish her degree in the US, and she gets tearful talking about leaving Akmal at the airport at the end of the theatre course (they had also been separated during the summers). “We had no idea how, but we just knew we’d be together,” she says. “But we didn’t end up seeing each other for 14 months.” They talked over Skype and by email. “Just waiting for that call, I couldn’t do anything,” says Akmal. “I couldn’t somehow feel complete.”Akmal was twice denied a visa to visit Sarah in the US, so they decided a fiance visa was their best chance. “We got secondhand rings at the bazaar,” says Sarah. “They had a little celebration for us at the theatre.” It took another seven months to get Akmal a visa, but in October 2014 he arrived in the US they got married that month.Sarah is Jewish Akmal is Muslim. Why has their relationship worked across countries and cultures? “I didn’t care about the cultural things,” says Akmal. “It just felt right and she was the right person.” Sarah says: “I remember being without him, it felt like I was missing a limb. We’d learned about each other in such intimate, subtle ways that we fuelled off of being together. Even apart, we maintained that.”Want to share your story?

But a few changes can help lift the burdenHuman beings are not built to endure prolonged periods of stress. If you want to see an extreme example of what it can do to a person, observe prime ministers as they enter and exit Downing Street. Before, fresh-faced, they simper for the cameras. Afterwards, they are gaunt, grey and lined. It is like watching an accelerated version of ageing, and a reminder of how stress corrodes the human body.The fact is, stress kills. Prolonged stress has been linked to heart disease, depression and diabetes. But how can you stay healthy when you are stressed? We asked some experts.The salty-sweet smack of snack foods is often the only thing that gets many of us through stressful times. But the crisps you inhale as a deadline looms will make you feel rotten in the long term.“When we’re overwhelmed, it’s easy to reach for a quick fix in the form of sugar-rich food and drink,” says Azmina Govindji, a registered dietitian and a member of the British Dietetic Association. “This gives you an instant spike in serotonin, the body’s feelgood chemical, but it won’t last – and neither will the fast rise in your blood glucose levels, which also gives you a temporary high.” Instead, opt for complex carbohydrates such as porridge or wholegrain bread, which will give you the energy you need to face a difficult day.Taking 10 minutes to eat lunch away from your desk will reduce stress levels and prevent unhealthy snacking. “Eat mindfully,” Govindji urges. “Get away from your desk, chew your food slowly and savour the flavours.”According to research from the American Psychological Association, a third of Americans reach for high-fat, high-calorie foods when stressed. “To avoid this, plan your meals to give you structure and control.” It is unrealistic to expect people to meal-prep during periods of high stress, but a very easy meal plan of porridge and berries for breakfast, a wholegrain sandwich for lunch and vegetable pasta or fish with potatoes and broccoli for dinner is achievable and healthy.Many of us are guilty of an all-or-nothing mentality when it comes to fitness. We hammer the gym hard before a holiday, but when life gets in the way, our fitness goes out of the window. However, exercise is a powerful natural stress-reliever that will flood your body with feelgood endorphins.To motivate yourself, the personal trainer Maiken Skoie Brustad advises you to “remember how good you feel after you train. After exercise, you’ll always feel better.”If you can’t afford to visit a gym, or have responsibilities that keep you at home, there are plenty of free home-based workouts that can be squeezed into a few minutes. “Write down a cardio circuit of five exercises – three high-intensity exercises, such as running on the spot or squat jumps, and then two ab exercises such as planks or crunches – stick a timer on for 45 seconds and do each exercise for two rounds.”Don’t feel guilty about taking time out to exercise. “You have to be strict with yourself,” Brustad says. “Say: ‘OK, on Tuesday I will clear an hour out of my schedule,’ and train no matter what. When you’re training, focus on why you’re there. It shouldn’t be a treat to give yourself time to train. It should be a necessary thing for healthy human beings.”It is not normal to exist in a state of perpetual stress. If you feel you are approaching burnout, your first port of call should be your GP. “We all have stress in our lives,” says Dr Zoe Norris, a GP, “but the definition of anxiety as a disease is different from stress.” If patients come to her complaining of stress, she will ask them whether they have been having palpitations, panic attacks or long-term sleep disturbances. These could all indicatebe indicators that they were struggling with an anxiety disorder.Even if your stress does not meet the clinical threshold for an anxiety disorder, it is a good idea to be mindful of your stress levels. “Almost every part of the body is affected by experiencing constant stress,” Norris warns. “We are not designed for it as humans.”Develop coping mechanisms. “Put into place protective factors to reduce the impact stress is having on you,” Norris says. Exercise, reading or socialising with friends are all levellers. “If you don’t have these coping mechanisms, what happens is that you develop bad coping mechanisms, such as drinking coffee to stay awake, then wine to help you sleep.”Some stress is unavoidable: a relative dying, for instance. But if your stress is work-related, Norris encourages her patients to speak to their boss. “If their employers aren’t accommodating, they may come to the conclusion they need to find somewhere else to work.”Stress is a trigger for self-destructive behaviour, such as smoking or drinking too much. “Lots of patients are keen on detoxes or Dry January, but sustained lifestyle changes are better in the long term.”When you are stressed, your sleep often suffers. But staying up late in order to tackle a growing to-do list is counterproductive. “If you are suffering from poor sleep, that will make your stress levels higher,” says Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist and the author of The Nocturnal Brain. “Getting as much sleep as possible when you’re feeling overwhelmed will help to manage your stress.”What about sleeping pills? “They’re a double-edged sword,” Leschziner says. He explains that they can be helpful as a short-term solution, when someone is under acute stress. “If your GP prescribes you a short course of sleeping tablets, for a maximum of two weeks, they can be helpful. People can get to a crunch point where they don’t sleep at all and they can end up in a nervous breakdown situation.” But you can’t rely on pills as a long-term solution to stress. “It’s easy to get on a slippery slope. It’s better to resolve your sleep issues by dealing with the underlying source of stress.” Cognitive behavioural therapy can also help address your anxiety and improve the quality of your sleep.“If you feel overwhelmed, it’s usually a combination of work and home-life factors,” says Andrew Kinder, an occupational psychologist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.Develop your support structures. “Look at your relationships,” says Kinder. “Who are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they’re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.”Problem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. “Get out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it’s festering in the background.”We live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you balance on top of your full-time job or the toxic culture of presenteeism that increasingly blights British offices. “Ask yourself the question: what do you really care about?” suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of Not Working: Why We Have to Stop.Strip your workload down to the essentials. “Excessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,” Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. “There’s so much that’s just window dressing, where you’re being seen to do something.” Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce.To avoid burnout, remember you don’t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. “Resist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won’t do your work any good in the long term. You’ll just end up resenting it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54995ce91bee2973aaa3f23b52be4633a0f0a373/0_583_5577_3346/master/5577.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c7cb06b9e4556d3ec2eb7200700053","title":"knitwear that blends seamlessly into the background in pictures","story":"Photographer Joseph Ford and knitting guru Nina Dodd have collaborated to create bespoke jumpers for people, humans and even fruit that are incorporated into their surroundings in painstaking detail.

It sounds simple, but when you want to impress, the temptation to overcomplicate food can leave you feeling overwhelmed and overworked. So how do you make food to remember, without breaking your back in the kitchen? The answer is to take inspiration from the French – not their haute cuisine, but their countryside cooking, which is just as tasty and a fraction of the effort. The secret is simply to use the best quality ingredients, which should be left to do the culinary talking for you. When the basics are really good, there’s not much more you need to do other than throwing them together.Chicken is a great example. If you buy a standard supermarket chicken, you have to cover it in herbs and spices or even marinate it overnight to get a decent flavour out of it. Get yourself a poulet de bresse, and it’s a whole different story. These birds have been bred in the same French province for centuries, they have loads of space to run around, and they’re encouraged to eat a varied diet. Because of all that, you can put it straight in the oven on a low heat for an hour, then take it out, cover it in salt, and put it back in on high for 15 minutes, and you’ve got a meal for four that tastes out of this world.If you’ve got really nice bull’s heart tomatoes, cucumber and some olive oil, it’s pretty easy to just mix it up into a great salad to go with it crap vegetables make crap salads, and then you need to make it more complicated to make it taste better, which is a false economy. French culinary sensibilities make solo dining low effort too. I remember sitting out one night in Portugal with a tin of Ortiz tuna and crusty bread, and I just spent the whole evening on my balcony eating that with some drinks. It was perfect – no mayonnaise necessary.Speaking of drinks, when it comes to cocktails the same rules apply. If you’ve got good quality Grey Goose Vodka, you don’t need to mask the taste with syrupy mixers. Rather, you should let the inherent quality of Grey Goose Vodka do the talking, using it as the perfect base for botanical and classic citrus flavours such as elderflower, lemon juice or lime juice, as they complement the vodka without overpowering it – both Le Grand Fizz and Paris to Pampelonne are cocktails that add something new to the vodka without distracting from its taste. Grey Goose cocktails are wonderfully versatile too. If you’re pairing with something sweet, an Espresso Martini with high-quality espresso will balance things out nicely.Going straight to suppliers gives your food a story as well, which makes for great dinner party conversation. Customers love it when we wax lyrical about where our produce comes from in my restaurants, and so will your dinner party guests. Around six years ago, I was Instagramming some fishermen in their boat, and they were telling me what fish they’d caught that morning, and the next day it was in my restaurant. People love to hear these sorts of anecdotes because they help them feel connected to the food, which is why “I got it from the supermarket” never quite cuts it when you’re entertaining at home. While you will probably have picked your vodka from the supermarket, with a brand like Grey Goose there’s still a story to tell. Grey Goose is made with only two ingredients: single-origin Picardie winter wheat and water from its natural limestone well – a true reflection of Grey Goose’s French sensibilities.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

These are the choices before you.”His approach, as set out in a statement from the national executive committee (NEC), was agreed on the conference floor with a show of hands as “composite 13”, calling for a remain stance, was defeated.A string of speakers throughout the debate at Labour’s annual conference in Brighton urged their colleagues to fall in behind Corbyn’s stance.With just months, or perhaps even weeks to go before a general election, there were fears that a show of disunity would harm the Labour leadership.When the remain motion fell after a show of hands, many stood and cheered, and broke into a chorus of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn”.The chair, Wendy Nichols, initially appeared to say the motion had been carried but then said it had been lost, after a conversation with Labour general secretary Jennie Formby, who was sitting alongside her on the conference stage.Nichols then rejected calls for a full card-vote, which would have led to a more forensic count of delegates’ votes.Labour’s conference has been rocked by a series of rows, which kicked off on Friday night with a botched bid to abolish Tom Watson’s post of deputy leader.Watson will give his own speech on Tuesday. According to extracts released in advance, he will urge colleagues to “draw a line under” the controversy.“Turning in on ourselves is a gift to the Tories. I didn’t choose the row going into this vital week for our party and our country, I didn’t want it, I didn’t seek it and I regret it. It was damaging, isive and unnecessary. Unfortunately we cannot pretend it didn’t happen. But let us now draw a line under it.”He will urge his party to look to the future, and take on Boris Johnson and the Conservatives in the coming election.“Now, of all times, we cannot let the Tories escape scrutiny. Labour must be together. This is a time to keep our gaze high. To remember who we are, and what we believe, and what we’re trying to achieve. Social justice, equality and opportunity for everyone in our country.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said the result of Monday’s vote showed that Corbyn still commands the loyalty of grassroots members. “The party is determined to unite behind its leader,” she said.Frontbenchers including Emily Thornberry and Clive Lewis have called for their party to declare its allegiance before a general election.Lewis said after Monday’s votes, “I think there will be huge disappointment amongst activists, members and many voters who were looking for a definitive outcome at this conference. But we know that the vast majority of MPs, the vast majority of the shadow cabinet, the Scottish party and the Welsh party will be campaigning for remain.”However, Labour strategists feared adopting an out-and-out remain position in advance of a general election would jeopardise their chances of holding on to scores of leave constituencies.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, whose speech wound up the debate, did not explicitly call on Labour members to support the remain motion.A 62-year-old Labour veteran who joined the party in 1974 and worked for Labour icon Tony Benn during his deputy leadership campaign in the 1980s. Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn’s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.Momentum, often described as a ‘party within a party’, has radically transformed the Labour party over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected.“I don’t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,” Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the . “What I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.” But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.Lansman was behind the move to scrap Labour’s 40-year-old student wing last week, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a “moderate” wing of the party. Lansman also tabled a last-minute motion at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson’s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.“We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn’t rather remain in the EU. The people must have the final say.“A referendum in which remain should, and will, be on the ballot paper, along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum.Starmer was at the late-night meeting on Sunday that resulted in two motions being drafted. Only the one which closely echoed the NEC’s statement was passed.Speaking afterwards, Starmer told a fringe meeting that he had “mixed feelings” about the idea of Corbyn staying neutral in an election and argued that the Labour membership was so overwhelmingly pro-remain that it’s “obvious the way this is going to end up”.Earlier, Momentum founder Jon Lansman had urged members to vote with their conscience, complaining that the NEC, of which he is a member, had not had the opportunity to scrutinise the wording of the statement properly.“There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership,” he said.Disappointed remain campaigners pointed out that Labour in Wales and Scotland has already adopted an anti-Brexit stance – and key members of the frontbench are on their side.Michael Chessum, of anti-Brexit campaign group Another Europe is Possible, said, “a fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply isive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.”“This vote was set up as a loyalty test, but those grassroots activists who ran the campaign – Momentum activists, people who have fought for the left in Labour for years, know this is a nonsense. We have come so far in pushing Labour’s position towards a public vote, and while we might all be disappointed by this outcome, we must now prepare for the election. If Labour loses, the consequences will be dire.”Some exasperated remainers claimed the conference hall had been packed by Momentum, in order to ensure the vote was won.But a shadow minister close to Corbyn said members had put their loyalty to the leader first, saying, “this is Jeremy’s party”.Several senior Labour figures responded to the vote by suggesting they would make clear to voters they will campaign for remain, whatever the party’s formal position at a general election.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said, “I do not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members.”Other opposition parties immediately seized on Labour’s decision to continue to try to appeal to both leavers and remainers in a general election.Stephen Gethins, the Scottish National Party’s Brexit spokesman, said, “Jeremy Corbyn is stuck firmly on the fence, refusing to come down and today’s votes show the rest of the Labour party is happy to stay there. This is a real abdication of leadership.“It beggars belief that more than three years after the EU referendum, and knowing the damage Brexit will do, Labour is still arguing over its position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30c3dbb092aca474b42f1501a2d3ebed0c74ae4/0_50_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca20de4e677a5354ab4f53cdcf1a503e","title":"john mcdonnell pledges shorter working week and no loss of pay","story":"Shadow chancellor sets out plan to end in-work poverty and cut working week to 32 hoursWorkers will enjoy longer holidays under a future Labour government as part of a 10-year plan to see the length of the average full-time working week drop by five hours, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has announced.Speaking at the party’s conference in Brighton, McDonnell said he wanted to see a marked cut in the average working week from 37 to 32 hours within a decade, with no loss of pay.The shadow chancellor said Labour would adopt a two-pronged approach to reducing the working week: the creation of a working time commission with powers to increase statutory leave entitlement, coupled with stronger trade unions able to negotiate cuts in hours with employers.Labour has ruled out a French-style blanket cap on the working week, which it considers unworkable. Despite concerns from business about the cost of the proposal, McDonnell believes a 32-hour week is feasible without job losses.The pledge follows the recent publication of a report by  Robert Skidelsky, which said the average working week for full-time workers was longer in the UK than in every EU country bar Greece and Austria.“I can tell you today that the next Labour government will put in place the changes needed to reduce average full-time working hours to 32 a week within the next decade,” McDonnell said. “A shorter working week with no loss of pay.”The shadow chancellor said that as a first step, a Labour government would end Britain’s opt-out from the European working time directive.“As we roll out sectoral collective bargaining, we will include negotiations over working hours. We’ll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements. This will allow unions and employees to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector.“And we’ll set up a working time commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment.”McDonnell said that due in large part to the efforts of trade unions, the average full-time working week had fallen from 65 hours in the 1860s to 43 hours in the 1970s. But in recent decades the link between increasing productivity and shorter hours had been broken. “It’s time to put that right,” McDonnell said. “We should work to live, not live to work.”Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said he was pleased that Labour had ruled out a cap on hours, but added that the UK’s productivity gap with rival countries could not be closed by simply reducing working hours.“Forcing a shorter working week on small firms is not feasible. Increasing productivity starts with a proper plan for investing in infrastructure and skills while simultaneously reducing the costs of doing business – not simply reducing working hours.”Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the business lobby group the CBI, said: “Who would turn down a four-day week on the same pay? But without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss.”McDonnell committed Labour to ending in-work poverty within its first term in office, stressing that this meant transforming the way the economy worked.“Transforming lives means, before anything else, having enough to get by. Not just to scrape by, but to live a rich and fulfilling life,” the shadow chancellor said.“We’ll restore full trade union rights and workplace rights from day one. We’ll roll out collective bargaining to enable workers to get their fair share of what they produce. We’ll bring in a real living wage of at least £10 an hour. We’ll end the barbaric roll-out of universal credit. We’ll cap rents and build a million new genuinely affordable homes.”The shadow chancellor said that while millions of workers were exhausted from overwork, there were too many others who needed to work for longer. Labour would ban zero-hours contracts to make sure every employee had a guaranteed number of hours a week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c626f1168f6fe6d17cc9358cedc4b982a877cd/78_207_5112_3067/master/5112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=980cd858db3da3577c9702d19d464bc4","title":"all change england rugby world cup usa","story":"Ben Youngs and Dan Cole are set to join Jonny Wilkinson as England’s third-most capped men’s international players on Thursday, with Eddie Jones poised to shuffle his side for their second match of the World Cup when they face the USA.Jones is also due to make a late call on the fitness of Henry Slade before naming his side on Tuesday after the utility back took a bang to the knee shortly after coming on against Tonga while Lewis Ludlam is in line for a first World Cup start in the back row.Youngs, who started against Tonga, and Cole, who came off the bench, are also set to feature in the 23-man squad and win their 91st England caps. Only Jason Leonard (114) and Dylan Hartley (97) have represented the England men’s side on more occasions.England flew south to Kobe on Monday 24 hours after opening their World Cup campaign with a scratchy bonus-point win over Tonga. They will have one proper training session on Wednesday before facing the USA.The two injury absentees are Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell, who are not due to be ready until the third pool match against Argentina on Saturday week, though England were awaiting further medical reports on Slade’s knee before Jones finalises his team on Tuesday. It was the same knee Slade injured in the buildup to England’s first World Cup warm-up match against Wales last month, though he was able to finish the match against Tonga. Joe Cokanasiga has also been hampered with a knee injury and his leg has been heavily strapped.After Sunday’s victory Jones was unsure how many of the 23 who featured would also be involved against the USA. Youngs may start on the bench with Willi Heinz in the No 9 jersey while Cole is more likely to start in place of Kyle Sinckler. At least nine of the starting XV against Tonga are set to be involved despite the four-day turnaround.“I’m in this World Cup bubble at the moment and, whilst those accolades are nice, I had no idea,” said Youngs, who will equal Wilkinson as England’s most capped back.“I remember making my first start for England and Jonny was involved and playing in Australia. He’s an icon of the game and to get this accolade is pretty cool.“When you first start out it goes fast and you’re in it and not really sure what’s going on. And then you get older and understand what gets you there, how you do it and how you sustain it. Getting there is almost the easy bit, the hard bit is sustaining it and staying there and being consistent in it.”England will be hoping for a far more polished performance after a litany of handling errors against Tonga meant the bonus point was not secured until the 77th minute.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterLast autumn, in an effort to prepare for this four-day turnaround Jones purposefully curtailed his side’s preparations before their victory over Japan, against whom he made 11 changes from the previous weekend. Ruaridh McConnochie, Mark Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Piers Francis and Jack Singleton were all hoping to be brought into the 23 for Thursday, having missed out in Sapporo, while Ludlam is set to cap a remarkable rise with a start at flanker. “If you had told me this time last year that I would be starting in a World Cup game, I would’ve told you you’re crazy,” he said. “Our focus last week was purely Tonga and as soon as that whistle went after the game, it switches to USA. It wasn’t a case or preparing for two games.”The USA have named eight England-based players in their 23-man squad, including the Saracens prop Titi Lamositele, Harlequins’ former American footballer Paul Lasike and the Bedford full-back Will Hooley, whom Ludlam played alongside at junior level.“We were both at Ipswich Rugby Club and then he was at school 10 minutes down the road from me,” Ludlam said. “It is weird he is playing for a different country but he is a really good bloke, he is down to earth, he is a good leader and I am sure he is keeping those USA boys in place.”On Sunday Jones claimed that the USA would be “all guns blazing, it’s going to be like 15 Donald Trumps”, but their coach, Gary Gold, opted against returning fire. “At this stage, with all due respect, we’re not a good enough rugby team to be making comments or answers to questions like that. I don’t know what it means.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f03106d88bfc2a64d2b1af614b2894e2cbf4ade/0_122_5300_3180/master/5300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdc62d16f8f6f7db13fa7b925cc172d2","title":"jonny bairstow left out of england test squad for new zealand tour cricket","story":"Jonny Bairstow has been challenged to fight his way back into England’s Test side as a specialist batsman after he was dropped for the upcoming series in New Zealand with the wicketkeeping role handed to Jos Buttler.In response to the 2-2 Ashes draw with Australia, Ed Smith, the national selector, has plumped for a reboot when England play a two-match series in late November (one that follows five Twenty20 internationals and sits outside of the World Test Championship points system).The uncapped Dominic Sibley and Zak Crawley will challenge Rory Burns and Joe Denly for spots in the top three, while the Lancashire bowlers Matt Parkinson and Saqib Mahmood also earn their first call-ups to both squads. Surrey’s precociously talented Ollie Pope gets a fresh Test chance after two fleeting appearances against India in 2018.But it is the decision to stand down Bairstow, just three days after renewing his Test central contract, that jumped off the page on Monday when Smith once again proved himself to be unafraid of shuffling the pack.The Yorkshireman boasts 69 caps but has made one half-century from 13 innings since regaining the gloves in February following a brief hiatus. Those returns sit in contrast with – but are possibly not unconnected to – his thundering performances as opener in England’s World Cup-winning team.Such is the sensitivity of the call and the cricketer concerned that Smith and his fellow selector, James Taylor, will now meet Bairstow in Leedson Wednesday, hoping they can convince a player who was previously so determined to keep wicket that he can instead convert himself into the batsman England would prefer.Smith said: “I’m using my words carefully. Jonny hasn’t been rested. That would be a cop out. However, I do see Jonny as being a top batsman, so I would say it’s an opportunity to reset and come back.“For whatever reason, whether it’s white-ball cricket, a busy schedule, keeping, I don’t have an answer. But I do have an aspiration and that’s that Jonny becomes a top batsman. I wouldn’t want to narrow his options but I want an open conversation with him. The primary issue is getting the most out of him as a batsman.”As well as diminishing returns and a growing propensity for being bowled, Bairstow’s demotion is linked with Root’s desire to return to No 4 come the first Test in Mount Maunganui on 21 November. Trevor Bayliss, the now departed head coach, felt No 3 was the right-hander’s best spot but with a replacement yet to be sourced, the captain’s personal vision has held sway.It is why England have opted for Sibley, the Warwickshire opener with 10 first-class hundreds in the past two years, and Crawley, the Kent right-hander picked more on style and potential, rather than choose between them. England also want Pope, notionally the reserve wicketkeeper for the second half of the tour with Ben Foakes placed on standby, to have an extended run at No 6 below Ben Stokes and above Buttler. The latter was first pick as selector last year, and a player now felt to be in need of a defined role beyond simply a lower-middle order wildcard.On Pope, who had shoulder surgery this summer, Smith said: “His numbers are outstanding but also his character – the way he came back in better shape is typical of him. We are excited about his future as we look to identify players with the DNA of a Test player.”With Jimmy Anderson now eyeing a return for South Africa in December – he and the similarly injured Mark Wood will attend a fast bowling camp there at the start of the month – his county teammate Mahmood comes in to offer pace and skills with the older ball. Parkinson, another rising star from Lancashire, will support Jack Leach.The leg-spinner’s big chance results from Moeen Ali’s desire to take a break from Test contention, one that has surprisingly earned the all-rounder an extended breather Smith cited Moeen as one of six players rested from the Twenty20 squad along with Jason Roy, who has lost his Test spot, Jofra Archer, Buttler, Root and Stokes.The World Twenty20 in Australia next October is a fresh priority for the white-ball side – Eoin Morgan will again captain after recommitting to the role – and England are keen to widen their pool of players in international cricket, allowing the more established players to further their experience in next year’s Indian Premier League.Somerset’s Tom Banton receives his first call-up as a result, following a blistering campaign in the T20 Blast, while fellow batsmen Sam Billings, James Vince and Dawid Malan all return. Pat Brown, the 21-year-old Worcestershire seamer with a deceptive knuckle ball, is another to benefit.Bairstow was also included but Smith said the decision on whether he or Billings keeps wicket will be made by Morgan and whoever is head coach. Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe, both in contention for the vacancy, sat in on selection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25664d5e6360d00b4cd042d285bcfa6ee19cb96/0_86_5294_3176/master/5294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0252c8a7a57eae1ae7a6675aebf36843","title":"kamaishi stadium rugby world cup tsunami","story":"There used to be a telephone box in the middle of the Kamaishi stadium. Nodoka Kikuchi reckons it was somewhere right around the halfway line. She’d know. She was the last person to ever use it. That was at a 2.45pm on 11 March 2011. She was 15, had just got out of high school, and was calling her parents to come and pick her up. A minute later, the great earthquake struck. “It started to shake from side-to-side,” she says. “It was terrible, I was holding on to the box, and my friend outside was hugging a gate, because it was the only way we could stand up.” Behind them, the earth of the school football pitch split open and water started to spray out of the ground “like a fountain”.Like all the children at Kamaishi High, and the next door Unosumai Elementary too, Nodoka knew exactly what to do. They were all supposed to meet at the evacuation point in schoolyard so the teachers could take a head count. But as she hurried there she heard one teacher shout: “We don’t have time to count! We should just run away!” And that’s what they did, all 570 of them, up into the mountains behind the school.They stopped at an old people’s home 800m uphill. The teachers were talking about what to do next when the aftershocks started. Rocks and boulders were tumbling down on them from the mountain so they ran again, hand in hand now, big kids paired with little kids, 300m further on, to the car park of a day care centre. The road was narrow, and they had to squeeze beside the cars coming up from the seafront. “There were about 600 people here, I was in the middle and I could see the people at the back didn’t have room to run in so I was shouting: ‘Making room! Run! Run! Please run!”•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterWhen they reached the car park, the teachers started another count. And that’s when Nodoka heard what she thought was a helicopter. Only she couldn’t understand why the whirring sound seemed to be coming up from all around, above and below and behind. Then she looked back.“Tsunami means wave, but it’s not a wave, I mean, that’s not what I saw. What I saw was like a great wall moving towards us.” Everyone fell silent. “Then someone shouted ‘tsunami!’ and I realised what it was.” They wanted to run higher, right up into the forests, but the ground was shaking now, and they were worried the mountains were going to fall down, just like the sea had risen up. The teachers led them safely to the highway instead, and they began the long walk inland. Two schoolchildren died. One, a friend of Nodoka’s, had stayed home, sick, and another had been collected by their parents. But everyone who stayed with the teachers survived.The tsunami killed more than a thousand people in Kamaishi, a town of just 35,000. Over 160 of the deaths were at the Unosumai District Disaster Control Centre, three minutes walk from Nodoka’s school. Many of the dead there had taken part in a tsunami drill just the previous week, but it had been so cold then that, instead of heading up the mountain where they were supposed to go, they’d stayed indoors at the Centre instead. When the tsunami came, that’s what they did again. The flood there was 11m deep.In the years afterwards, they would call what happened at Nodoka’s school “the miracle of Kamaishi”. But she and her friends have never liked to that name. “A miracle,” says her colleague Miyuki Kanie, “would have saved everyone.” And besides, she adds, it wasn’t an act of God that got them through it. The children lived because their teachers made the right decisions. And the townspeople have carved that lesson in stone at the new Tsunami memorial. “Just run! Run uphill! Don’t worry about others. Save yourself first. And tell the future generations that a tsunami once reached this point, and that those who survived were those who ran.”The “miracle of Kamaishi” has become a famous story, one which has been repeated over and again in the media here. They even made a film about it. It’s one of those tales we tell each other for succour, because it allows us to believe in hope and mercy where there isn’t any. And in that way it’s similar to how we’ll talk about the new rugby ground they’ve built on the site of those two old schools, the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium. From our remove, flying in for these few days, the two World Cup matches that will be played here – Fiji face Uruguay on Wednesday– seem a powerful symbol of Kamaishi’s redevelopment. But this isn’t our story to tell.“For most of the old people, the World Cup coming here is very meaningful,” says Miyuki, who moved here last March. “The local team were very strong a long time ago, when they won the championship seven years in a row, so rugby is especially popular with old people. But to tell the truth, young people are not so interested.” It’s a fact, she says, that the recovery has moved more quickly here than elsewhere because the World Cup has spurred it on. There are only around 20 local families left in temporary accommodation, and they will be rehoused by the end of the year. “So I don’t think many people were against the idea of the World Cup,” she says, “because of that, and because they knew how important rugby was to Kamaishi. It has given people new energy. But I know some kids have complicated feelings about it.”Nodoka is one of them. “When I heard the stadium was being built I was shocked,” she says, “because it felt like they were destroying my memories. I had such complicated feelings then, thinking about our school, and our lives, it was a big loss.” Over time, though, as she has watched the construction work, that has changed. “While I watched the stadium going up I started to digest all my feelings, the sadness, the guilt, the nostalgia. And I feel like they’ve settled now. It’s all passed. It’s just part of my history, of who I am. And I feel like if they hadn’t destroyed the school to make this new stadium, I never would have gone through that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928e0289fd46e5c78c16b65498032ea2c547c8fd/0_302_5124_3075/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168a2136c3722e40914cfbec3a55e131","title":"russia face tokyo olympics ban over inconsistent moscow lab data athletics","story":"Russia faces the prospect of being banned from next year’s Olympics in Tokyo after the World Anti-Doping Agency gave it three weeks to explain apparent inconsistencies in data from its Moscow laboratory or to suffer the consequences.Wada confirmed on Monday that it had opened a formal compliance procedure against Russia and also asked it to explain how a number of positive drugs tests had been deleted from a database extracted from the lab in January.Sources close to the situation believe there is now a strong possibility Russia will be banned from the Olympic Games and it is not inconceivable such a punishment could also extend to competitions in any sport signed up to Wada’s code, including the football World Cup.On Monday, the IAAF, athletics’ governing body, said its council had unanimously agreed that the Russian Athletics Federation would remain suspended, as it has been since 2015, meaning that its athletes will still not be able to compete under their own flag when the World Athletics Championships begin in Doha, Qatar on Friday. Instead they will compete as “authorised neutral athletes”.Stanislav Pozdnyakov, the president of Russia’s Olympic Committee, admitted the situation was “very serious” and could jeopardise Russia’s Olympic participation.“We have spent vast diplomatic efforts to regain the trust of the international sports community and for Russian athletes to have the right to take part in Olympics without any restrictions,” he said. “But now we again run the risk of facing sanctions.”Wada lifted its ban on the Russian Anti-Doping Agency in September 2018, much to the anger of the wider global anti-doping community and athlete groups. Critics said the Russians had refused to accept the findings of the McLaren report that concluded its government was involved in a massive doping conspiracy.Wada said it had to compromise in order to get the data from the Moscow lab, which it had wanted since 2015, in order to build cases against athletes suspected of being involved in a state-sponsored doping programme.However, Wada’s board was told on Monday that investigators had also found inconsistencies between a data set passed to it by a whistleblower in 2017 and the evidence extracted in January.Jonathan Taylor, chairman of Wada’s committee tasked with overseeing Russia’s compliance, told the New York Times the Russians needed to “pull a rabbit out of a hat” to avoid new penalties. “There were positive findings that were deleted the question is why … We will give them a chance to explain.”The Russian sports minister, Pavel Kolobkov, said the ministry would cooperate with Wada, adding that experts in the field of digital technology would be involved.The chief executive of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, who has repeatedly warned that Wada was being played by Russia, said he was unsurprised by the latest news.“Let’s hope there are no secret backroom deals but that justice is finally served in an open, transparent and public manner,” he said. “The world, and especially clean athletes, have already been yanked around enough already.”The IAAF also confirmed it would meet the German TV channel ZDF, which said on Sunday it has footage of two Kenyan athletes – one male, one female – competing in the world championships injecting the blood-boosting drug EPO. ZDF also made allegations about positive doping tests being hidden in the country.Athletics Kenya has denied any wrongdoing, with Barnabas Korir, a member of its executive, telling ZDF: “We make sure that our national team follows the rules. The athletes know the consequences: if someone has doped, they are thrown out of the team and never wear the national colours of Kenya again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231bfd83dbba7ef0bc84549ef4ee332bb3888772/0_180_4918_2951/master/4918.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c79fdbe09f7d99c11c656ead7d67509","title":"world cup kicking tactics","story":"Tactical kicking is increasingly important and England and Owen Farrell are masters of the artAfter watching New Zealand, South Africa, England and Ireland – the four most-fancied teams at the World Cup – play their first matches over the weekend it is already clear how much of a weapon tactical kicking is going to be. All four teams needed no second invitation to put boot to ball. In England’s case it was maybe a little too much but, as I have said before in these pages, they are the best tactical kicking team in the world so it is no surprise they played to their strengths.I see it as a popular way of playing at this tournament for a number of reasons. First, the conditions. Whether it is rain, as was the case for Ireland’s emphatic win over Scotland, or a slippery, sweaty ball as with England against Tonga, we are seeing teams more comfortable without the ball. On top of that defences are so strong now that more often than not they are going to be on top. If you add in the fact that the offside line is not being policed as strictly as it could be, then teams with the ball are under so much pressure that kicking becomes a way of negating that line speed.Even a team like Russia were so aggressive off the line and it can be really hard to play against. It can be done – that 10-minute blitz from New Zealand showed how – but most of the time the defending team has 13 men on their feet. They play with two, or maybe even one, in the backfield so the kicking game is a very effective way of getting round that press defence. Maybe this is going to be a World Cup where not having the ball is best in certain areas. You can be in the middle of the field with the ball, turn it over and all of a sudden you are defending a lineout on your own try line. You also have to consider that at the back of the mind of defenders there is the worry of taking the chaser out in the air.In the All Blacks against South Africa match I fully expected the Springboks to go after George Bridge and Sevu Reece in the air, which they did, but Aaron Smith turned the tables on them and New Zealand came out on top in the aerial battle, particularly in that period when they seized control of the match. It was the same with Ireland. Conor Murray was on the money, as was Johnny Sexton, with Jacob Stockdale, Jordan Larmour and Andrew Conway leading the chase against Scotland.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterEngland were equally impressive in the air but, if I have one complaint about their performance, it is that they kicked a little too often when they might have shown more ambition. They just kicked away possession a bit too much. They have a certain style of playing with George Ford and Owen Farrell there. We know that England are going to play that way, back their defence and use the aerial battle, which they used very well. Jonny May was brilliant before he went off, Anthony Watson as well. But it was more the situations where there was turnover ball, in and around the halfway. When Tonga kicked poorly, for at least the first hour England just kicked it back.It is an effective way of playing but you saw what happened when Watson decided to put the afterburners down and have a bit of a crack. Yes, it was against tiring defence and I’m not saying it was a poor tactic but in certain situations, turnover ball or when Tonga kicked poorly, they had an opportunity to play a couple of phases. They could have stretched it to the edge – they have kickers on the edge, May can kick, Watson can kick, Daly can kick, so I just think they could have got the ball there a little bit more.England’s kicking is fantastic, there is such clarity to it, and everyone knows precisely what they need to do. You see it off kick-offs, exiting from their 22, whether it’s five- or six-man lineouts, whether they are driving then a box kick, or there’s one phase with Billy Vunipola hitting up and then a box-kick from there or use Ford and Farrell with those high crossfield kicks. It may be a bit predictable but it’s hard to stop. We will see plenty more of it. I would have just liked to see a bit more variety against Tonga."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67e82bb30b270d4e35c874ff019bb9dc6c823449/0_344_2500_1499/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=311cc98476589cc6aa3aff45ff4e444d","title":"friends at 25 the best episodes","story":"Joey’s hand twin, Rachel’s meat trifle, Ross’s luminous teeth ... as the most popular show on the planet hits 25, here are its most classic momentsTwenty-five years ago, a sitcom debuted on NBC. Starring a clutch of beautiful yet little-known starlets, the sitcom was envisioned as a line in the sand for young Generation X-ers. This was their show, discussing the things they wanted to hear about. It was vital. It was epochal. The sitcom was called Madman of the People, and it was cancelled after one season after reviews called it “impoverished” and “noxious”.However, the show that debuted one hour before Madman of the People was Friends – a sitcom that became so staggeringly popular it still qualifies as one of Netflix’s most watched shows. What better way to celebrate this anniversary than picking through all 236 Friends episodes to find the funniest 25?Season five’s double-length finale might be best known for yanking the RossRachel will theywon’t they thread until it all but snapped – it’s where they get drunk and get married – but don’t forget it’s also the one where Joey discovers his hand twin.The episode where Chandler and Monica announce their relationship to Monica’s parents and where Rachel makes a trifle with meat in it.Nobody in the world wants to watch Apple’s new series The Morning Show. But what if I told you it will reunite Jennifer Aniston with Reese Witherspoon, the woman who played her spoilt little sister Jill in Friends? Still no? Fair enough.After deciding to tell Ross about her feelings for him, Rachel is staggered to see that Ross has a new girlfriend and, in response, gets off with a terrible Italian man. Fun fact: this was the first episode of a new season, and the cast looked so dramatically different from the previous year the writers had to squeeze in an entire plot explaining why.The episode where Ross and Rachel stop baby Emma crying by explaining how sexually attracted they are to large buttocks (“You really do like big butts, don’t you? Oh, you beautiful little weirdo!”). Notable for being one of the only episodes where Ross thinks about other people.Where Monica almost blinds herself to the extent that she kisses the son of a man she used to go out with, and Chandler sits in a box.The plan was for NBC to run four episodes of four shows, all set during the same blackout. Mad About You complied. Madman of the People complied. Friends complied, resulting in the episode where Chandler gets trapped in an ATM with Jill Goodacre. Seinfeld did not comply. Seinfeld is the best.Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part one.Where Ross loses his girlfriend to her ex and he just stands there watching. My theory is that, had Friends been made in 2019, Ross would spend most of his time on Reddit. Maybe when the reunion happens.Ross is so creepy. Take this episode, where he uses his position of power to date a girl much younger than him. When the reunion happens, there will be an episode of Friends where Ross spends the whole time downvoting movie trailers with female leads.Not that there’s a theme here or anything, but this is the episode where Ross mansplains karate a lot then goes out of his way to truly frighten a couple of women to prove a point.A neighbour of the friends suddenly passes away and this moment manages to teach many of them important lessons about their lives. So, you know, at least his death wasn’t in vain.Frasier was better than Friends – don’t argue, it was – but this was Friends at its most Frasierest. Chandler and Monica are dating, and the rest of the gang all know to some degree, but they don’t know how much the others know. A beautifully-plotted episode that ends with Ross watching his sister have sex. Which is very Ross.Ross has a girlfriend he doesn’t love, but he tells her he loves her anyway because he is weak. He gives her the keys to his apartment then changes the locks because he is weak. Rachel wants to have sex with Ross because she is silly.The one where Phoebe is going out with Paul Rudd then kisses someone who isn’t Paul Rudd, because she wouldn’t know a good thing if it pushed her under a steamroller.This came two episodes before The One Where Everybody Finds Out and sees Joey flailing like mad to stop everyone else finding out about Chandler and Monica. It’s arguably one of Matt LeBlanc’s finest performances and therefore one of the episodes that got the spinoff Joey made, so therefore the worst episode of Friends. Also, Ross gets angry about a sandwich, because of course he does.By this point, more out of boredom than anything else, Joey and Rachel are together. This is the episode where Ross discovers the betrayal and has a minor nervous breakdown (“E is for how extremely normal I find it that you two are together!”). Looking back, it was a real shame that Friends ended a year before The Game was published. Ross would have loved that.In which Rachel asks Ross what his deepest sexual fantasy is and he replies that it’s a woman in a bikini from a film made for children to enjoy. God, Ross is the worst.Where Ross gets so protective about the area in a library that contains his doctoral dissertation that he pretty much flat-out becomes a vigilante to ensure it’s treated with adequate respect. Did I mention that Ross was the worst?Where Rachel starts dating someone who looks like Ross, acts like Ross and has a name that sounds similar to Ross.Eddie was the best character ever to appear on Friends, for having an abrasive streak that wasn’t usually present in the series. In this episode, Chandler throws Eddie out of the apartment after waking up to see him standing over him. He chooses to do this by gaslighting Eddie a nice reminder that, while Ross is the worst, Chandler is a pretty close second.One day, our ancestors will realise that people who had been stung by jellyfish liked to urinate all over themselves and they will trace it all back to this episode. It doesn’t even work. Trust me.Ross tries to alter his body but too much, part two. “Oh my God, you can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!”In which Ross opens the door to a woman to discuss the smells of different types of gas until she runs away in a fit of abject panic. Oh Ross, you genuinely troubled man.A truly great episode that manages to flit from comedy to heartbreak to romance with barely a change in gears. This episode is widely considered the best Friends episode of all time, and is apparently a favourite of David Schwimmer, possibly because it’s one of the only ones where Ross doesn’t look or act like a serial killer.What are your favourite moments from Friends?

What the UK is doing is trying to bring people together and de-escalate tensions,” he told Sky.The Stena Impero was dramatically seized on 19 July as it passed through the strait of Hormuz after Iranian officials claimed it had infringed maritime regulations. Footage released by Iran showed Revolutionary Guards descending from a helicopter to take control of the ship and detain its 23 crew members.About two weeks earlier, British Royal Marines seized an Iranian supertanker off the coast of Gibraltar carrying 2.1m barrels of crude oil that UK authorities alleged was to be sold to Syria in breach of EU sanctions against Bashar al-Assad’s government. Iran has denied the Stena Impero’s impoundment was a tit-for-tat move.The takeover, which led the UK to advise its ships to temporarily avoid the strait of Hormuz, was part of a wave of sabotage attacks and seizures of ships over the past six months in and around the narrow waterway through which more than a quarter of the world’s oil supply passes.The US and Gulf states have blamed Iran for the incidents, including the alleged use of explosives against four oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May, suspicious fires on two tankers in the same area in June and the attempted seizure of a British vessel in July, allegedly by Iranian boats that were driven off by a Royal Navy warship.A Gibraltar court ordered the release of the Iranian vessel, then called Grace and since renamed Adrian Darya 1, on 18 August after receiving written assurances from Iran that it would not head to countries under EU sanctions.The Adrian Darya switched off its transported near the Syrian coast earlier this month. Satellite imagery of the ship analysed by the independent service TankerTrackers showed the vessel near the Syrian port of Tartus on Sunday, casting a thin shadow that suggested it could still be laden with oil.That would contradict assessments by the UK, which has said it believes the oil onboard the ship has been sold to Assad’s regime, as well as claims by Iranian officials that Adrian Darya’s cargo was sold to a private company in a ship-to-ship transfer.The Islamic republic’s oil exports have fallen from about 2m barrels per day in August 2018 to about 160,000 barrels a day after the US imposed sanctions in November.Washington is seeking to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement that Donald Trump unilaterally pulled out from in May last year.Trump said the deal, which traded curbs in Iran’s nuclear programme for relief from sanctions, needed to also address Iranian missile development, human rights abuses and sponsorship of proxies. Iran had been in full compliance with the agreement when it was breached by the US.In his Sky interview in New York on Monday, Johnson echoed Washington’s position in calling for Tehran to return to the negotiating table. “Whatever your objections to the old nuclear deal with Iran, it’s time now to move forward and do a new deal,” he said. The incidents in the strait of Hormuz have led the US to create the international maritime security construct, an alliance of countries including Bahrain, Australia and the UK, whose vessels are trying to deter Iranian intervention against oil tankers in the area.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have both signed up to the construct in the past week since the attack on Saudi oil facilities that the kingdom said involved Iranian-made weapons."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3361439d402414a22deeea5a8d1fd9355c0b656b/643_834_2499_1499/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=615526c3abeb318056f257287cc11201","title":"israel boost for netanyahu as three arab politicians refuse to back rival","story":"Israeli president tasked with choosing candidate to form Israel’s next government after inconclusive electionBenjamin Netanyahu has come out narrowly ahead of his rival, Benny Gantz, during consultations with Israeli parliamentarians on who should lead the next government, although it remained unclear if he would be chosen to form a coalition.President Reuven Rivlin ended two days of talks on Monday with representatives from all the Knesset parties, following a stalled election last week that has thrown uncertainly over the country’s political future.Members from rightwing, centre-left, religious, far-right nationalist and Arab parties gave their recommendations on who should lead. By the end of talks, Netanyahu was one point ahead, with 55 endorsements over Gantz’s 54.However, Rivlin, who is tasked after an election with picking a candidate to form a government, has suggested that since neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority of 61 seats that they form a unity government together.“A stable government cannot be formed without the two big parties and this, I believe, is the will of the people,” Rivlin’s office quoted him as saying.The president invited Netanyahu and Gantz to meet him for closed-door talks late on Monday evening in a effort to break the deadlock. Discussion could continue into next week before a decision is made.On Sunday, Gantz appeared to briefly be the favourite after an alliance of Arab parliamentarians who largely represent Palestinian citizens of Israel announced they would endorse the ex-military general.Support from the Joint List, which won 13 seats in Tuesday’s polls, made the bloc the third-largest force in the 120-seat Knesset. However, Rivlin said on Monday morning that three Arab politicians from the Palestinian nationalist Balad party had abstained – putting Netanyahu ahead by one recommendation.Rivlin, whose role is usually ceremonial, is not obliged to pick Netanyahu. He can choose any candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a government. Usually, the decision is clear, and often goes to the leader of the largest party, but the muddied election result has created an impasse.Netanyahu has backed the idea of a unity government, although he has been coy about who would lead or if the role would be rotated. Gantz has ruled out serving with Netanyahu, who is facing the prospect of three corruption indictments.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.If they do not join together, the president has the power to choose either, who will then have up to six weeks to form a majority government. If that person fails, Rivlin could then ask a second candidate.That scenario played out in May after Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition following a similar election result. But rather than give the opposition a chance to forge a government, he instead pushed to dissolve the Knesset, triggering repeat elections and giving himself another chance.Many fear a third election will be called if the current stalemate continues. Israel’s apparent kingmaker, the far-right ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, has said he will not back either and also called for a unity government.Sunday’s endorsement of Gantz by Arab parties, while not giving him a clear lead, broke an almost-three-decade policy of not supporting an Israeli leader while the occupation in the Palestinians territories continues.The last time Arab parties backed a candidate was in 1992, when they  supported Yitzhak Rabin, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Palestinian citizens of Israel, or Arab Israelis, make up close to a fifth of the 9 million population.Leaders in the group made clear they were not backing Gantz, who led a devastating 2014 war on Gaza, but instead attempting to topple Netanyahu, whose election campaign focused on demonising Arab Palestinian citizens and who pushed for a law they say made them second-class citizens.“We have become illegitimate in Israeli politics in the Netanyahu era,” the leader of the Joint List, Ayman Odeh, told Rivlin when informing him of the endorsement. “We are this time recommending Benny Gantz to form the next government.”The prominent Arab parliament member Ahmad Tibi added: “History is done: we’ll do what is needed to bring down Netanyahu.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7c12dc65840fe01812fff2c72776f86719c86e1/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee6ef871518cf590dc0dc1cc15785c98","title":"saudi arabia iran france germany uk","story":"The UK, France and Germany have said they are convinced that Iran was responsible for airstrikes against Saudi oil installations, and called on Iran to negotiate over its role in the Middle East and its development of missiles as well as its nuclear programme.In a joint statement at the UN general assembly, the three European governments supported the US and Saudi claim that Iran had carried out the missile and drone attack on 14 September against an oil field and petrochemical processing facility, but they maintained support for a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran they were party to, but which the US abandoned in 2018.“It is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation. We support ongoing investigations to establish further details,” the statement said following a meeting between the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron.The statement said that the attack raised the risk of a major new conflict, which was of concern to the whole world. It underlined the importance of collective security and multilateral action, and restated the European nations’ commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal.It called for Iran to return to the limits on its nuclear programme imposed by that agreement, which Tehran has begun to ignore more than a year after the US withdrew from the deal.But the statement said Iran would now have to go further, arguing “the time has come for Iran to accept a long-term negotiation framework for its nuclear program, as well as regional security issues, which include its missile programs,” the statement said.Iran has denied responsibility, insisting the strikes were launched from Yemen by their Houthi allies.Monday’s statement came hours after Boris Johnson said he believed that Iran was responsible for the attack.Speaking to reporters on his plane en route to the UN general assembly in New York, the prime minister said: “I can tell you that the UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks. We think it very likely indeed that Iran was indeed responsible, using both drones and cruise missiles.“Clearly, the difficulty is how do we organise a global response, what is the way forward. We’ll be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf region.”France has sent investigators to examine the weapons fragments collected at the site of the attacks. The UN has also sent an investigative team, which has yet to deliver a report. Iran has said it will not necessarily accept the results of that report, calling into question the impartiality of the UN team.The European statement comes as the US and Iran are poised to clash at the UN general assembly. Donald Trump is due to address the assembly on Tuesday, and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has already arrived in New York, will speak the next day. Both are expected to blame the other for the worsening instability in the Gulf.At the same time that the statement was issued, the US envoy on Iran, Brian Hook, was laying out US evidence against Tehran. He told the Asia Society in New York that the projectiles used against the oil installations did not have the range to have reached their target from Yemen. He said the US would await the UN report for a final judgment.It is unclear what would follow if the UN results supported the US, European and Saudi version of events. The US has made clear it is not considering military action for now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/234caad445c21daf82efebf03e67c323f3f7d740/0_143_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094a6fa72a69f6b463bff20231456f95","title":"uk to snub franco german alliance for multilateralism","story":"UK decision not to send minister to meeting is sign of how Brexit is shifting foreign policyBritish ministers are to snub a major new “alliance for multilateralism” being launched by France and Germany at the United Nations general assembly this week in a fresh sign of how Brexit is shifting British foreign policy.The alliance, due to be launched by the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, and the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, is intended to act as a bulwark against what Le Drian has described as “the wilding of the world” and the abandonment of the rules-based order set up after 1945.The initiative, in the planning for six months, has inevitably been seen as a thinly veiled rebuke to the increasingly vocal advocates of national sovereignty such as Donald Trump.The alliance’s first meeting in New York on Thursday is due to be attended by more than 50 ministers but Britain is not sending a minister.The alliance is regarded by France and Germany as its most important joint diplomatic response to nationalism, and the British refusal to embrace the plan underlines how much Brexit may lead to a wider parting of the ways between the UK and Europe.In the past in debates between advocates of national sovereignty and multilateralism, the UK has always sided with the multilateralists.Countries that have signed up to the agreement, according to Le Drian, include France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Singapore, Ghana and others. Le Drian made no mention of the UK. He said: “The symptoms of a true wilding of the world accumulates, putting in peril the multilateral edifice which we collectively developed, as we learned the lessons of two great world wars.”The aim he said “was to give a voice to the immense majority of countries that believe in the efficiency of international cooperation”. Calling the alliance an ambitious humanist project for the 21st century designed “to fight those that are destroying the international order”, Le Drian said the multilateral structures built after the second world war did not threaten national sovereignty.Instead, he said such structures were “a collective guarantee and protection against the law of the strongest, including basic humanitarian law that protects civilians in time of war. Multilateralism is both a method and a goal. In a word multilateralism is humanism.”Confirming the British ministerial absence from the launch on Thursday, a diplomatic source said the alliance was never intended to be a membership group with formal participation but instead an organisation for cooperation.He said the UK supported one of the six initiatives, which are headed: call for trust and security in cyberspace, international partnership for information and democracy, joint position of the group of friends on climate and security, education equality at the centre initiative and finally, 11 principles on lethal autonomous weapons systems.The move came in the wake of the US president cutting funding for the United Nations, withdrawing from the UN human rights council, Unesco and the Paris climate agreement.Le Drian and Maas stressed their initiative was not directed against the US, and Maas added that he would be happy to see the US join the effort.“Whoever wants to join us can join us – it is against nobody,” said Mass.Critics on the left claim the plan is in fact primarily in France and Germany’s national interests since they are the great beneficiaries of the status quo, and so are reluctant to reform institutions to allow currently marginalised nations a greater stake. Others have criticised the plan for being too vague, or duplicatory of the UN’s work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14022c8340f239f5a9c4707be4cb9c08eb02f1c/0_150_4808_2885/master/4808.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92234f28180e2aa6ec6cf9a5ef939557","title":"what is the point of the un general assembly","story":"As its 74th session looms, we examine the annual meeting where world leaders get their 15 minutes in the spotlightThe UN general assembly is the world’s parliament, where all the UN’s 193 member states are represented. Each sovereign state gets one vote so it is not exactly representative of the world’s population but then again, its votes are not binding on the membership, except in budgetary matters.The general assembly is not nearly as powerful as the security council, which can pass binding resolutions, and is dominated by the five permanent members, the US, China, the UK, France and Russia, who each have a veto.But the general assembly can express world opinion, make recommendations to the security council and elect the council’s non-permanent members. The 74th session takes place this month.The general assembly and the security council are two of six main organs of the UN. They sit alongside the secretariat (the general secretary, António Guterres’, office), the international court of justice (seated in The Hague), the economic and social council (a policy coordination body) and the trusteeship council.The only time the world really pays heed to its great talking shop is the week commencing 23 September, when the high-level general debate takes place at its customary moment in the annual diplomatic calendar.The world’s leaders converge on New York, where each is given an (unenforced) time limit of 15 minutes to speak in front of the green marble podium and orate in front of the world. Leaders occupy positions in the hall in alphabetical order by country name, usually with a different nation occupying the first seat each year.In truth, the general assembly week usually makes news in the first day or two, when the US president and other powerful heads of state tend to have their moment, and then attention tends to tail off.For that reason, there is always some horse trading before the general assembly week, with prime ministers from big countries trying to swap speaking slots with presidents of small countries.The general assembly is also the preferred venue for America’s great antagonists to land a few blows while on US soil. Nikita Khrushchev, Hugo Chávez and Muammar Gaddafi all had a go at this. Gaddafi unleashed a 90-minute diatribe in 2009 but that was pithy compared to Fidel Castro’s record 269 minutes in 1960.More recently, Binyamin Netanyahu made headlines in 2012 by bringing visual aids to illustrate his allegations against Iran, one of them a cartoon bomb.Good question. It is more about posturing than policy but there are summit meetings on critical subjects. Barack Obama chaired a meeting on nuclear proliferation at his first general assembly in 2009.This year, there is a climate action summit on the eve of the general debate, attended by the teen activist, Greta Thunberg. Putting the climate emergency centre stage and forcing states to do something are two very distinct things, however.Not a lot, it has to be said. A large section of east midtown Manhattan is closed to traffic and roads outside the zone are frequently blocked to allow for the motorcades criss-crossing the area. The sidewalks are filled with people in suits with collections of passes around their necks arguing with police about which entrances they can use.It is good news for midtown hoteliers, however. They are booked up months in advance. The power centre during general assembly week used to be the Waldorf Astoria, where the US ambassador’s residence was situated in a penthouse suite. It is also where the US would host many of its meetings in the margins of the general assembly. But the US moved out after the hotel was bought by the Chinese insurance group, Anbang.One visitor tried to break with the routine of luxury hotels. When he attended in 2009, Gadaffi tried to pitch an enormous tent in the town of Bedford, 45 miles north of New York, until the locals complained. The owner of the site said he had no previous knowledge of Gaddafi’s camping intentions. The landlord’s name: Donald Trump.The big question this year, like last year and the year before that, is who is going to meet whom on the sidelines of the assembly. In that way it has the same compelling appeal as a dating show, watching two people who plainly hate each other try to find something in common. This year, like last year, there was some early anticipation of a meeting between Trump and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani. That started off unlikely and has veered towards the near impossible following last week’s attacks on Saudi oil installations.Trump and Rouhani both face resistance within their own governments to any form of reconciliation. There would have to be a significant easing of sanctions for Rouhani to agree to a Trump meeting on the sidelines of the general assembly but there are few signs that Trump would be willing to do this.Trump might be keen to spring a surprise encounter, to generate some positive headlines, but that is not how Tehran operates. Rouhani is still being criticised in Iran for taking a phone call from Barack Obama as Rouhani was leaving UNGA in 2013, without checking in first with Iran’s supreme leader.Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro was expected to make his UNGA debut, to defend his policies against the near consensus view that they are destroying the Amazon. But his attendance is in doubt in the wake of surgery for a hernia caused by a knife attack during the campaign a year ago. He has vowed to show up, even if confined to a wheelchair. It is a unique opportunity to grab the global spotlight. By an accident of UN history, it is traditional for the Brazilian head of state to be the first world leader to talk at UNGA, on the first morning while everyone is still paying attention. Bolsonaro’s doctors however, may take a different view.Boris Johnson might welcome his general assembly appearance as a ersion from domestic woes. A second meeting with Trump is likely as both men have an interest in not looking isolated on the world stage. Face time with a US president is always an objective for most visiting leaders, to show their electorates their importance on the world stage.The circumstances of such an encounter can also be important. In 2009, the then UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, was desperate for even a brief meeting with Barack Obama. The meeting finally happened but under humiliating circumstances. Brown got a “walk and talk” with Obama in the UN kitchens. As Obama strode past the pots and pans and gas ovens, Brown had to try to keep up and talk, out of sight of the world’s cameras.Trump could try to achieve something on his stalled North Korea talks at this general assembly, either some progress with the Pyongyang regime, or a meeting of security council powers, in a bid to fix the holes in sanctions enforcement and put the screws back on.Trump’s speech is expected to focus on global religious freedom, and he could well refer to the current US priorities at the UN, fighting abortion rights around the world and for a conservative stance on gender issues.Some leaders might not bother with the general assembly at all. Vladimir Putin is a regular no-show. The Russian president tends to come only once a decade and the last time was in 2015.A bigger question is whether Venezuela’s beleaguered president, Nicolás Maduro, will turn up. He came at the last moment in 2018, but this year, with the US and its allies no longer recognising him as head of state and accusing his regime of numerous crimes, his presence in New York, even as the theoretically protected guest of the UN, would be a much more risky endeavour.Although it is the UN secretary general who gets the limelight for most of the year, the event gives the president of the general assembly, elected each year by the member states ahead of general debate, a chance to shine.This year it is Nigeria’s Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. After the initial excitement of greeting the world leaders, however, it is rather a thankless task, introducing each leader to the assembly and then sitting through one speech after another, most of them turgid and self-congratulatory.This is the world’s biggest summit and it attracts a lot of side events because of the proximity and potential participation of world leaders. The most glittering of these events is the Goalkeepers conference run by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, where celebrities, activists and politicians will talkbout global inequality."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4027793.1569253927!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach says ireland to phase out oil exploration off coast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland is to phase out oil exploration off coast.The Government is to phase out oil exploration off the coast of Ireland, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced.Speaking ahead of Monday’s climate summit in New York, Mr Varadkar said that a decision had been made to stop oil exploration off the coast of Ireland, though gas exploration will be continued.Standing alongside Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton, the Taoiseach said the Government had received advice from the Climate Advisory Council which has recommend to change the policy when it comes to exploration.“Recognising that we end exploration for oil in Irish waters, we will continue to explore for natural gas given that it’s a transition fuel that we are going to need for the next few decades, as new technologies are developed and deployed.”He said Ireland would be one of the few countries in the world to make the decision to start phasing out exploration for oil, because of its commitments to achieve carbon neutrality. He also noted that the decision was made on the basis of scientific advice from the advisory council which is chaired by Professor John Fitzgerald. His comments come after the Government announced it would be ring-fencing funding from a carbon tax for climate policies.“Any extra money raised from carbon tax will be ploughed back into climate action”, he said, including retrofitting, renewable energy and greener farming.Mr Varadkar will address the climate summit later on Monday.He also said he was disappointed that US president Donald Trump will not attend the summit.Instead the US president is addressing a conference on religious freedom, also in the UN complex.“I think it’s disappointing that President Trump isn’t attending the climate conference today… it would be better if the president of America, the country the world looks to for leadership, attended what is the most important event of the day,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4028127.1569272542!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar pledges end to irish oil exploration with gas to follow","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach  Leo Varadkar at the 2019 Climate Action Summit in New York: “By 2030, we will have prohibited the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles.” Photograph: Justin LaneIreland will pursue a policy of ending fossil fuel exploration on foot of scientific advice about its climate impact, the Taoiseach has announced – though the search and extraction of gas will be permitted for some time as the country transitions to a carbon-free economy.“In the last week, on foot of a request from me, our independent Climate Change Advisory Council recommended that exploration for oil should end, as it is incompatible with a low-carbon future,” he told the UN Climate Summit.The Government has been embroiled in controversy in recent months because exploration licences continued to be issued by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which environmental NGOs said was not sustainable given the climate crisis facing the world.The council recommended exploration for natural gas should continue for now, he said, “as a transition fuel that we will need for decades to come while alternatives are developed and fully deployed. I accept this advice and Ireland will now act on it.”Mr Varadkar confirmed that from next year, all new revenue raised from carbon tax would be ring-fenced to fund new climate action and just transition and cited measures already committed to under the Government’s climate action plan.He emphasised that a major portion of this additional revenue would go towards a “just transition to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs and for whom new jobs must be found”. The additional revenues would fund the transformation of transport, electricity, buildings and food production systems. Coal off-gridThis would “provide billions” to make change possible – this is separate to €30 billion allocated for climate action under the national development plan.He confirmed coal would be off the electricity grid by 2025. “Our renewable electricity will rise from 30 per cent today to 70 per cent in 10 years. By 2030, we will have prohibited the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles. By then we will have substantially electrified our fleet. All new public buses bought from now are hybrids.”On land use, Mr Varadkar said Ireland is to plant 440 million trees and “will work with other countries to reform the EU Common Agriculture Policy to shift payments towards farmers who farm in more sustainable and environmentally sound ways”.On Ireland’s green credentials, he added: “For almost a thousand years, my country, Ireland, has been associated with the colour green . . . In the future, I want Ireland to be known as a green country because of how we respond to the climate and environmental challenges facing our planet.”Leadership was required to take action, he added, “And I believe leadership is also required to convince people that it is not too late to act.” Single-use plasticsOn Ireland’s climate record, he said we had already banned fracking.“We have a climate action fund paid for by a levy on oil. Our sovereign wealth fund has ested from fossil fuels. We will outlaw single-use plastics next and our public sector is already doing so.”On the leading role Ireland is playing, at the request of UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, on citizen engagement and ensuring greater involvement of young people in climate policy generated by national parliaments, he told the assembly: “We are leading the preparatory coalition on youth and public engagement in the Marshall Islands, Nigeria and Namibia.“Our new international development policy prioritises those countries who are most vulnerable to climate change – a crisis not of their making – particularly the least developed countries and small island developing states.”The Taoiseach concluded his three-minute speech by saying he wanted “to replace a climate of fear and anxiety with a new climate of action and opportunity responding to the challenge of the century with creativity, with imagination and with courage”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4027960.1569262211!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"labour party votes against adopting remain stance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDelegates voting on Labour’s Brexit policy during the party conference in Brighton on Monday. Photograph:   Gareth FullerPA WireJeremy Corbyn has seen off an attempt to commit Labour to campaign to remain in the European Union in a second referendum on Brexit. Delegates at the party’s annual conference in Brighton instead backed the leadership’s proposal to wait until after a general election to decide on Labour’s position.The rejection of a motion backing an unequivocal Remain position came amid chaotic scenes in the conference hall when the chair refused to call a card vote after a show of hands that some delegates viewed as inconclusive. Wendy Nichols, who was chairing the proceedings, said she initially thought the motion was carried but she was overruled by general secretary Jennie Formby, a close ally of Mr Corbyn.Despite calls from the floor to move to a card vote, Ms Nichols insisted that the decision was final and that the motion was defeated.Monday’s votes mean that if Labour wins the next general election, it will seek to negotiate a new Brexit deal within three months and put that deal to a referendum within six months, with the other option being to remain in the EU.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told the conference that an incoming Labour government would legislate immediately for a referendum.“We need to ask the public whether they are prepared to leave with the best deal that can be secured. Or whether they wouldn’t rather Remain in the EU. The people must have the final say. A referendum in which Remain should – and will – be on the ballot paper. Along with the best leave deal that can be secured. We owe it to those who want to leave to secure that leave deal and put it to them in a referendum,” he said.“So I have a very simple message today: If you want a referendum – Vote Labour. If you want a final say on Brexit – Vote Labour. If you want to fight for Remain – Vote Labour. Labour will let the people decide.”Most of the trade unions affiliated to Labour, who control 50 per cent of votes at conference, backed the leadership’s position and opposed the motion calling for an unequivocal Remain position. Momentum, which supports Mr Corbyn but is pro-Remain, on Monday called on its delegates to back the leadership and reject the pro-Remain motion.Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, whose party wants to cancel Brexit by revoking Britain’s article 50 notification to withdraw from the EU, said Monday’s vote showed that Mr Corbyn was a Brexiteer at heart.“Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart,” she said.“He is determined to negotiate a Brexit deal if Labour win an election, despite all the evidence that there is no Brexit deal that is good for our economy, our NHS and our security.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Andy RainEPAJeremy Corbyn’s allies defeated Monday’s attempt to move Labour behind an unequivocal Remain policy by making the decision a vote of confidence in his leadership. Speaker after speaker in the debate stressed the importance of remaining united behind Corbyn by postponing a decision on the party’s Brexit policy until after a general election.Earlier in the day, Momentum advised its delegates to back the leadership and oppose the Remain motion, despite the group’s deep opposition to Brexit. And most of the unions who control half the votes at conference were also behind Corbyn.If the motion had passed, Labour would have gone into the next general election promising to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU – which it would then campaign against in a referendum. The party could still end up campaigning against its own deal in a referendum where Remain is the other option.But Corbyn’s victory means it will go into the election promising to give voters a final say on Brexit. This distinguishes Labour from the Conservatives, who have ruled out a second referendum, and the Liberal Democrats, who want to cancel Brexit with an act of parliament.Labour activists in Remain-voting seats fear they will lose votes to the Liberal Democrats and the chaotic scenes surrounding the vote did nothing for the party’s image. Wendy Nichols, who was chairing the session, said after the show of hands “in my view it was carried”.But after she was contradicted by general secretary Jennie Formby, a close ally of Corbyn’s, Nichols insisted that it had been lost and could not be put to a card vote in which every vote would have been counted.“If it was carried, I would have said that,” Nichols said to uproar in the conference hall and bewilderment outside.Radical policy initiativesThe tumult over Brexit overshadowed some radical policy initiatives at the conference, including a universal social care system offering free care in the home to the elderly regardless of income. Labour’s proposal to abolish private schools has provoked outrage in parts of the media but it is unlikely to trouble the 93 per cent of parents who send their children to state schools.Labour has had a chaotic, rancorous conference so far and the party’s isions have been on full display in Brighton. But after the supreme court rules on Tuesday morning on Boris Johnson’s suspension of parliament, Labour’s troubles could be forgotten very quickly.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But maybe this time they’ll finally bring him down.  Photograph: Alastair PikeAFPGetty ImagesEveryone here is keyed up for the Big One. The One that’s going to finally bring Donald Trump down.As soon as the news broke Wednesday night in the Washington Post that a whistleblower had accused the president of making some sort of nefarious “promise” during a call to a foreign leader, the hive erupted.Democrats haven’t been able to get Trump on paying off a porn star to protect his campaign. They haven’t been able to get him on being a Russian agent. They haven’t been able to get him on obstruction of justice. But maybe this time. Maybe this was the One where all would decide that they wanted impeachment, that the president’s behaviour was so outrageous that they couldn’t imagine this sleazy business guy sitting in the Oval Office playing a tinpot dictator in a tinfoil hat for another second.Maybe this was the One that would finally move Republicans to turn on the Grendel who is terrorising the village and gulping down their party. Certainly, Trump himself didn’t think so. As the capital was going into overdrive-freak-out mode Friday night trying to flesh out the whistleblower story, the president was busy tweeting about a children’s book by a Fox News host: “Buy this Book – great for the kids!”WhistleblowerIf House Democrats can ever get their paws on the whistleblower, maybe they can make up for the judiciary committee’s performance with Corey Lewandowski this past week, which left many wondering if these hearings designed to pry Trump out of office are just making Democrats look foolish.They certainly provide an ample platform for Trump loyalists to rail against their favourite deep state foils. When failed presidential candidate Eric Swalwell tried to get Lewandowski to read a message Trump had dictated to him, the witness nastily referred to the Democrat as “President Swalwell” and told him to read the message himself.The internecine strains between the impeach-now Nadler crowd and the get-him-out-in-2020 Pelosi crew grew more bitter. Politico reported that in a closed-door meeting, House speaker Nancy Pelosi shocked lawmakers and aides by harshly criticising the House judiciary committee staffers for propelling the impeachment effort far beyond where the Democratic caucus stands. “And you can feel free to leak this,” Pelosi said acidly.In an interview with NPR, she said she hadn’t changed her mind on impeachment, but she does think Congress should pass new laws so future presidents can be indicted. She said everyone had now seen what the founding fathers could not imagine: a president blatantly abusing the constitution he has sworn to protect.Above the lawTrump has certainly been working hard to prove Pelosi right that presidents should not ever be above the law. By Friday night, while Trump was readying for a state dinner with his ultraconservative pal from down under, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times were reporting that the secret whistleblower complaint involved this: Trump repeatedly pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine – about eight times, the Journal said – to work with Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s loony personal lawyer, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden.Giuliani has been pushing a story about the former vice-president and his son, who had ties to a Ukrainian oligarch. After a fair bit of babbling on Chris Cuomo’s CNN show, Giuliani spit out some truth, that he asked Ukrainians to look into the Bidens.Later he tweeted: “A President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job.” Crooked Donald thinks he can create a Crooked Joe narrative just like he created a Crooked Hillary one. Which is it, Donald: Crooked or Sleepy?Escaped the nooseSo just consider this: Around the same time that Trump escaped the noose after Robert Mueller’s tepid testimony, sliding away from charges that he colluded with a foreign country to interfere in our election, he began arm-twisting another foreign country to interfere in our election. “Questions have emerged,” the Times said, “about whether Mr Trump’s push for an inquiry into the Bidens was behind a weeks-long White House hold on military aid for Ukraine.The United States suspended the military aid to Ukraine in early July, according to a former American official. So the president is under suspicion of making like Nixon and abusing power to go after his enemies, saying it would be a shame if anything happened to that military aid that you want because you don’t dig up some dirt on the son of my political rival.Pelosi’s acerbic statementThe administration kept the whistleblower’s complaint from Congress, even though Congress has the legal authority to know what this urgent complaint is about. Pelosi issued an acerbic statement on Friday, noting that Joseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, was violating the law by refusing to disclose the complaint to Congress.“If the president has done what has been alleged, then he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy,” she said. Trump is literally acting like an international mobster. Roy Cohn would be so proud. So is this the Big One? We don’t know because so much has come before. But if it is? Now that would be big.Read more about the Donald Trump administration"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then

replacing them with\u0026nbspalgorithms\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspcheap offshore labour, according to a new report.White-collar recruitment specialist Hays found that with jobs like paralegal work and administration, new technology is making these roles redundant, leaving over-qualified professionals working in lower-tier positions instead.UK wages flatline as robots take office jobs, pushing skilled workers into low-paid rolesPA news agencyGoogle limits storage of audio to be snooped on by human beings\u0026nbspGoogle says it will cut down on the amount of audio it stores from its voice assistant, after outrage over the use of human reviewers to snoop on people\u0027s recordings without their knowledge.\u0026nbspTech firms including Google, Amazon and others have faced anger after it was revealed they hired hundreds of staff to listen in\u0026nbspto clips of recordings from AI assistants.\u0026nbspGoogle said that\u0026nbspit will now ask every user to re-affirm their choice before it starts storing their personal audio.\u0026nbspThe tech giant will also let users make their device less sensitive to the phrase Hey Google, with the hope of reducing false activations which result in audio being recorded and stored without their knowledge.\u0026nbspApple\u0027s Siri and Amazon\u0027s Alexa as well as Microsoft and Facebook - have all faced criticism over similar privacy concerns.Some human reviewers employed by the tech firms, ostensibly to check the accuracy of AI assistants, claimed they heard private, intimate and illegal conversations while carrying out their jobs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTube staff ready to take industrial action over assaults on London Underground\u0026nbspAfter a surge in violent assaults on London Underground workers, the Rail Maritime and Transport union has warned strike action could be stepped up.\u0026nbspA shocking attack took place in East London last week, the RMT said.\u0026nbspRMT general secretary Mick Cash said: It is clear that violent crime is spiralling out of control as staffing levels are hacked back to the bare bones in the dash for budget-driven cuts.A key group of our members will be taking action from later this week and we will have no hesitation in escalating the dispute of that is what it takes.\u0026nbspRMT has warned repeatedly that the all-out drive towards an automated and faceless Tube would turn our trains and stations into a criminals\u0027 paradise and those who have ignored those warnings should act now before more serious injuries or worse occurs on the Tube.Thomas Cook collapse leaves couple\u0027s\u0026nbsp£40,000 wedding in jeopardy\u0026nbspA bride and groom whose wedding party paid £40,000 for flights and hotels through Thomas Cook are nervously waiting to find out if their marriage can go ahead following the collapse of the travel giant.The UK\u0027s largest peacetime repatriation has been launched after Thomas Cook ceased trading in the early hours of Monday morning when they failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal.\u0026nbspHeartbroken Amy Wright, 27, and a wedding party of around 40 people were due to travel on 3 October to the island of Kos in Greece.Her sister Katie Langley, 23, told the PA news agency the group had paid between £35,000 and £40,000 for the two-week trip through Thomas Cook, including flights and hotels.\u0026nbspMy sister got a phone call from the travel agent at 7 o\u0027clock this morning. She\u0027s been helpful and said she\u0027ll put us at the top of the list, she said.\u0026nbspThomas Cook staff have been really helpful but it\u0027s the people from above who aren\u0027t telling people what to do.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s biggest investor seeks to oust controversial CEO Neumann\u0026nbspAdam Neumann\u0027s time in charge of WeWork could be drawing to a close as the firm\u0027s biggest investor reportedly draws up plans to oust him.\u0026nbspWeWork\u0027s much-hyped stock market flotation was put on hold earlier this month after receiving little interest from investors worried about an inflated price, questionable business model and unusual corporate governance arrangements.\u0026nbspJapan\u0027s SoftBank, is now looking for ways to get rid of Neumann, Reuters reported, citing\u0026nbspfour people familiar with the matter.Softbank ploughed millions into WeWork at a sky-high valuation of $47bn in January. Now, the office sharing start-up is struggling to attract buyers for its shares at a third of that price tag and could be forced to launch an IPO at $10bn, according to the news agency.\u0026nbsp\u0027Dreadful\u0027 data from Germany\u0026nbspClaus Vistesen, Chief Eurozone Economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, has issued a damning assessment of the problem\u0027s facing Germany.\u0026nbspAnother dreadful set of PMI data from the Eurozone’s largest economy, Vistesen says.\u0026nbspThe contraction in manufacturing worsened with the PMI sliding to a gruelling 41.4, from 43.5 in August, and what’s worse, the services index also weakened, to 52.5 from 54.8 last month. Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3. Uncertainty over global trade, and the tariff stand-off between China and the US, are now driving a deterioration in German manufacturing, which is as bad as during the 2008 crash.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMike Ashley in yet another takeover bid\u0026nbspMike Ashley appears to have an insatiable appetite for takeover deals - despite swoops for House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa, as well as interest in HMV and Patisserie Valerie, the retail mogul has launched a big for Goals Soccer Centres.\u0026nbspSports Direct, the jewel in the crown of Ashley\u0027s ever-expanding retail empire, revealed today that it put forward a 5p-a-share approach for Goals\u0026nbspon 5 September.\u0026nbspSports Direct already owns 18.9 per cent of Goals, which recently uncovered improper behaviour with its accounts dating back to 2010.\u0026nbspGoals has not yet allowed Sports Direct to look at its books.Thomas Cook collapse latest\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor (a firm which specialises in corporate restructuring), has commented on today\u0027s news.\u0026nbspMs Palmer noted that a number of factors contributed to the collapse, such as Brexit and the rise of online bookings, but said the company\u0027s management strategy\u0026nbspcould have played a role in its demise.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbsp“Questions do have to be asked of the management’s strategy. Other competitors, such as Tui, have faced similar issues yet have weathered this storm and developed a more compelling product offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Unfortunately, the Thomas Cook model was heavily based on a legacy model of high street travel agencies combined with a lacklustre online offering.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“But whatever the reasons for Thomas Cook’s demise, the UK travel industry will be reeling for some time with the loss of one of its most respected and historic names.”\u0026nbspTo follow all the latest updates on Thomas Cook\u0027s collapse, head over to our dedicated live blog:\u0026nbspLabour pledges 32-hour working week\u0026nbspThe UK would move from being one of Europe\u0027s most overworked nations to being one with the most leisure time, under plans unveiled by shadow chancellor John McDonnell.\u0026nbspHe told the Labour Party conference that, if elected, his party would reduce the average full-time working week to 32 hours with no loss of pay within a decade.\u0026nbspA new Working Time Commission would be handed the power to recommend increases in annual statutory leave requirements while a Real Living Wage of at least £10 an hour would be introduced.\u0026nbsp“We should work to live, not live to work,”\u0026nbspMr McDonnell said.\u0026nbspLabour would also restore powers to trade unions on day one, he added.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s political editor Andrew Woodcock has the full story:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour commits to 32-hour working week within a decade\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour’s embrace of Universal Basic Services “can renew social contract”, say academics\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s latest plans for the economy show a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate, say a group of experts at the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London.\u0026nbspThe academics and economists praised John McDonnell\u0027s pledges to massively expand the provision of social housing\u0026nbspfree bus travel, meal provision for those most at risk of food insecurity and basic phone and internet access.\u0026nbspThey said the cost of the policy - around £42bn - could be entirely funded through changes to the Personal Allowance on income tax.\u0026nbspProfessor Henrietta Moore, Director of the UCL Institute for Global Prosperity, said:Adopting the Institute for Global Prosperity’s vision for Universal Basic Services as policy represents a major step forward in renewing the social contract in the UK. It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Billions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal. Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement today.No-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 effect on millions of car industry jobs, say manufacturers\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook is no more – what now for its 21,000 staff?\u0026nbspThe collapse of Thomas Cook has left over 150,000 holidaymakers currently abroad facing a premature end to their holiday. For hundreds of thousands of others, who were yet to travel with the company, the only remaining option is to claim their money back.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut for Thomas Cook’s 21,000 employees, the end of the line for Britain’s oldest travel firm means something much worse: the loss of their jobs. That is usually the outcome of the type of the insolvency procedure used to wind up the company – a compulsory liquidation.\u0026nbsp“Generally on a compulsory liquidation, with some exceptions, staff unfortunately lose their jobs as the business quickly ceases trading,” explains Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova has the full story:\u0026nbspWhat now for Thomas Cook\u0027s 21,000 staffCarlos Ghosn agrees US settlement over $140m of income hidden from shareholders\u0026nbspFormer Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has agreed\u0026nbspto pay the US financial watchdog $1m to settle charges of concealing $140m of income he was set to receive in retirement.\u0026nbspGhosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly, along with other Nissan subordinates, engaged in a scheme to hide Ghosn\u0027s income, the Securities and Exchange Committee said.\u0026nbspEach year, Ghosn fixed a total amount of compensation for himself, with a certain amount paid and disclosed and an additional amount that was unpaid and undisclosed.\u0026nbspInvestors are entitled to know how, and how much, a company compensates its top executives. Ghosn and Kelly went to great lengths to conceal this information from investors and the market, said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC\u0027s Division of Enforcement.\u0026nbspSimply put, Nissan\u0027s disclosures about Ghosn\u0027s compensation were false, said Steven Peikin, Co-Director of the SEC\u0027s Division of Enforcement. \u0026nbspThrough these disclosures, Nissan advanced Ghosn and Kelly\u0027s deceptions and misled investors, including US\u0026nbspinvestors.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThis would result in higher car prices for consumers because manufacturers will not be able to absorb all of the extra costs, the group said.The car industry is one of the most deeply integrated across Europe, meaning it faces some of the biggest disruptions of any sector as companies with sites in the UK are forced to adapt to the new reality of tariffs and delays caused by border checks and additional administrative tasks.Across the EU, one in 16 of the workforce is employed in the car industry, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Within the UK, close to a million people are employed in the sector or in jobs supported by it, a number of which are at risk from the impact of\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspInvestment by carmakers has plummeted from an average of £2.5bn to £2.7bn over the past seven years to just £90m in the first six months of 2019.Car industry workers want to leave the EUWhile the UK is expected to be hit hardest by a disorderly exit from the EU, manufacturers across the English Channel are not immune either.“Brexit is not just a British problem,” said Christian Peugeot, president of the French automotive trade body\u0026nbspCCFA. “We are all concerned in the European automotive industry and even further.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Many analysts will use this as justification for evidence that the manufacturing recession is spreading into the rest of the economy, but the problem is that the services PMI is an unreliable indicator for such a shift.\u0026nbspIt often exhibits large swings for no reason whatsoever. That said, we don’t want to stand in the way of the main story here. These headlines are ugly, and more-or-less confirm that the German economy entered recession in Q2 and Q3. Uncertainty over global trade, and the tariff stand-off between China and the US, are now driving a deterioration in German manufacturing, which is as bad as during the 2008 crash.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMike Ashley in yet another takeover bid\u0026nbspMike Ashley appears to have an insatiable appetite for takeover deals - despite swoops for House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Sofa, as well as interest in HMV and Patisserie Valerie, the retail mogul has launched a big for Goals Soccer Centres.\u0026nbspSports Direct, the jewel in the crown of Ashley\u0027s ever-expanding retail empire, revealed today that it put forward a 5p-a-share approach for Goals\u0026nbspon 5 September.\u0026nbspSports Direct already owns 18.9 per cent of Goals, which recently uncovered improper behaviour with its accounts dating back to 2010.\u0026nbspGoals has not yet allowed Sports Direct to look at its books.Thomas Cook collapse latest\u0026nbspJulie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor (a firm which specialises in corporate restructuring), has commented on today\u0027s news.\u0026nbspMs Palmer noted that a number of factors contributed to the collapse, such as Brexit and the rise of online bookings, but said the company\u0027s management strategy\u0026nbspcould have played a role in its demise.\u0026nbspShe said:\u0026nbsp“Questions do have to be asked of the management’s strategy.

It shows a clear commitment to enhancing the living standards of millions in an increasingly insecure economic climate.Our ideas around UBS were developed in response to the changing realities of the modern economy. The livelihoods and life chances of millions of people are coming under increasing threat from rising costs for housing, food and other essentials. At the same time, too many are faced with insecure work, low pay and the prospect that their jobs and whole industries could disappear due to automation and technological change. Simply carrying on as we have before will not alter these trends.UBS provides an affordable way for us to meet these challenges, providing an enhanced safety net that can simultaneously provide the foundations for full participation in our economy and stem the rampant inequality that’s eating away at our society. To operate effectively, we have outlined how it must go hand-in-hand with democratic accountability at local level. UBS must be an expression of our shared social needs, with communities themselves in control.Billions of euros in revenues supporting millions of jobs are at risk from the “seismic” impact of a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit, Europe’s car makers have said.As the UK hurtles towards the 31 October Brexit deadline with little sign of a new deal, bodies representing the industry united to issue a joint plea to avert a no-deal. Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement today.No-deal Brexit will have \u0027seismic\u0027 effect on millions of car industry jobs, say manufacturers\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook is no more – what now for its 21,000 staff?\u0026nbspThe collapse of Thomas Cook has left over 150,000 holidaymakers currently abroad facing a premature end to their holiday. For hundreds of thousands of others, who were yet to travel with the company, the only remaining option is to claim their money back.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBut for Thomas Cook’s 21,000 employees, the end of the line for Britain’s oldest travel firm means something much worse: the loss of their jobs. That is usually the outcome of the type of the insolvency procedure used to wind up the company – a compulsory liquidation.\u0026nbsp“Generally on a compulsory liquidation, with some exceptions, staff unfortunately lose their jobs as the business quickly ceases trading,” explains Emma Shipp, partner at law firm Hewitsons.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBusiness and economics editor Olesya Dmitracova has the full story:\u0026nbspWhat now for Thomas Cook\u0027s 21,000 staffCarlos Ghosn agrees US settlement over $140m of income hidden from shareholders\u0026nbspFormer Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has agreed\u0026nbspto pay the US financial watchdog $1m to settle charges of concealing $140m of income he was set to receive in retirement.\u0026nbspGhosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly, along with other Nissan subordinates, engaged in a scheme to hide Ghosn\u0027s income, the Securities and Exchange Committee said.\u0026nbspEach year, Ghosn fixed a total amount of compensation for himself, with a certain amount paid and disclosed and an additional amount that was unpaid and undisclosed.\u0026nbspInvestors are entitled to know how, and how much, a company compensates its top executives.

The survey, of more than 3,000 adults, showed that 28 per cent are undecided.Andrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, said: “Private schools entrench inequality and Labour is right to seek to integrate private schools into the state system by removing their tax breaks and changing how universities select students.“But private education cannot just be banned because that will breach the human rights which the Labour party rightly cherishes. Instead, Labour needs to make sure that private schools are not an attractive option for parents when compared to a brilliant system of state education.”However, shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued scrapping private school fees could boost the economy.He told BBC Radio 5Live: “What I think we’ll find is that for the large number of people who would be, at the moment, spending money on private education, that money actually will go into the wider economy and stimulate the economy.”Both the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Mr Corbyn attended private schools.On Sunday, Mr Corbyn tweeted: “Every child deserves to get the very best education, no matter their background. A Labour government will end the privilege that is entrenched by private schools.”Mr Johnson has criticised Labour’s plans to abolish private schools as being both expensive and “pointless”.The Eton-educated prime minister has said it would cost £7bn of taxpayers’ money to educate all the pupils who would no longer be educated privately.He also accused Mr Corbyn of “unbelievable hypocrisy” over the proposal, highlighting that the Labour leader, as well children of several Labour cabinet ministers, attended a private school.“It’s extraordinary that they’ve excavated this from the crypt of what I thought to be long buried socialist ideology,” Mr Johnson said.\u0026nbspAsked if he thinks he would be PM if he had not been privately educated, Mr Johnson replied: “I’ve been very fortunate in my life in all sorts of ways and I certainly owe a lot to my education.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All these things, they required effort, and they cost more money but my bosses never presumed to know better than I did.“They understood that when you put value into a person, it empowers that person to get in touch with their own inherent value. So the next time a woman, especially a woman of colour – because she stands to make 52 cents on the dollar compared to her white, male counterpart – tells you what she needs to do in order to do her job, believe her. One day she might stand in front of you and say thank you for allowing her to succeed because of her workplace environment and not in spite of it.”Chernobyl\u0026nbspalso won in the Writing and Directing for a Limited Series category.

These qubits make use of a quantum phenomena known as superposition, meaning they exist in two states at once.The ability to act as both a ‘one’ and a ‘zero’ at the same time,\u0026nbspquantum computing systems are theoretically able to be exponentially more powerful than classical computers with every qubit added.This exponential rate was called into question earlier this year by computer scientists at Google’s quantum computing lab, who observed that their systems were gaining power at a “doubly exponential” rate.IBM plans computers millions of times faster than any beforeHarmut Neven, director of Google’s Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, told\u0026nbspQuanta\u0026nbspmagazine in June that their most advanced quantum processor was improving at a rate far beyond what they thought was theoretically possible.Mr Neven said that such a rate of development was almost unfathomable, as there is nothing that grows that quickly in the natural world with which to draw a comparison.“It looks like nothing is happening, nothing is happening, and then whoops, suddenly you’re in a different world,” he said.The Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment on the leaked research paper.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most of the patients are young men, in their teens, twenties or early thirties.The University of Adelaide researchers said their findings show tougher government regulation of vaping was now required.“There are no regulations on the manufacturing of e-liquids. There are also no requirements to list the ingredients or their quantities,” said Miranda Ween, one of the scientists behind the study.Mystery vaping-related illness kills man in eighth US deathAs such, no two ‘’apple’, ‘chocolate’ or ‘cotton candy’ e-liquids will be made with the same flavouring ingredients, or even concentrations. These are the things that we know can affect how unsafe a particular e-liquid is.”E-cigarettes and the vapour they produce must no longer be considered to be essentially harmless alternatives to traditional cigarettes, the study’s authors concluded.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is monitoring the US outbreak of illness, said they had not yet been able to identify which particular chemicals or substances might have triggered the vaping deaths.But the CDC investigation has found many of the victims had pockets of oil clogging up cells which are responsible for removing impurities from the lungs.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That could let people lay their AirPods or Apple Watch on the back, and have them take power out of the phone\u0027s battery.New iPhone update will include bugs and have missing featuresiFixit now says that Apple appears to have worked on that feature for the iPhone and then pulled it. The decision presumably came late in the phone\u0027s development, given the parts are still inside.The site reported that the extra connector in the battery appears to connect straight to the wireless charging coil in the back, and that it appeared to behave in a way that suggested it was watching to ensure it did not get too hot while charging up.The discovery has led some to speculate that Apple could turn on the feature at a later date, using a software update that would remotely activate it. But Apple may choose not to mention the feature at all, or only bring it to future devices.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths.

Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  West performed with a choir of 80 singers flown from California to Wyoming on Sunday morning.The music included 14 choir pieces focused on worship and nontraditional hymns, as well as reworked versions of songs by No Doubt and Nirvana.West recently purchased a ranch property south of Cody.He\u0027s expected to release his new album,\u0026nbspJesus is King, on 22 September.\u0026nbspHis most recent studio album\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspYe, which debuted in June last year.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music.

Such an outcome, they said, would have an “immediate and devastating” impact on one of the continent’s most successful sectors and employer for 13.8 million people across the EU.“The UK’s departure from the EU without a deal would trigger a seismic shift in trading conditions, with billions of euros of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability on both sides of the Channel,” a group of 21 national trade associations, along with a number of Europe-wide bodies, wrote in a statement on Monday.“The end of barrier-free trade could bring harmful disruption to the industry’s just-in-time operating model, with the cost of just one minute of production stoppage in the UK alone amounting to €54,700 (£50,000).”Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, chief executive for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocateThis would result in higher car prices for consumers because manufacturers will not be able to absorb all of the extra costs, the group said.The car industry is one of the most deeply integrated across Europe, meaning it faces some of the biggest disruptions of any sector as companies with sites in the UK are forced to adapt to the new reality of tariffs and delays caused by border checks and additional administrative tasks.Across the EU, one in 16 of the workforce is employed in the car industry, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Within the UK, close to a million people are employed in the sector or in jobs supported by it, a number of which are at risk from the impact of\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspInvestment by carmakers has plummeted from an average of £2.5bn to £2.7bn over the past seven years to just £90m in the first six months of 2019.Car industry workers want to leave the EUWhile the UK is expected to be hit hardest by a disorderly exit from the EU, manufacturers across the English Channel are not immune either.“Brexit is not just a British problem,” said Christian Peugeot, president of the French automotive trade body\u0026nbspCCFA. “We are all concerned in the European automotive industry and even further.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By simulating all the variables, town planners would be able to figure out ways to eliminate traffic congestion and pollution issues – or at least understand them better.But if they could simulate entire cities, then why not entire universes? This was the question posed by MIT professor Seth Lloyd, who suggested that the world we exist in is in fact a giant quantum computer.\u0026nbspBeyond theories that we are actually living inside\u0026nbspThe Matrix, this ability to perform complex simulations could eventually see quantum computers simulate the beginnings of the universe and maybe one day answer some of science’s most puzzling questions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon denounced it as an “abdication of responsibility”, while Conservative chair\u0026nbspJames Cleverly said it showed Labour was offering only “more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay”.There was anger after the crucial vote, which took place amid chaotic scenes at the Brighton gathering, as disputes broke out over whether the vote by a show of hands had been passed or not.\u0026nbspNational Executive Committee official Wendy Nichols, who was chairing the session, admitted she had initially thought the vote was in favour of Remain, but was told by general secretary Jennie Formby that delegates had in fact voted against. She resisted angry demands for a card vote to get a precise measure of the balance of opinion.Under rule changes agreed last year and implemented at this conference, delegates no longer have the right to demand a card vote, which is instead at the discretion of the chair.Created with Sketch.Brexit and climate protests at Labour party conference: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn walks past anti-Brexit campaigner on the second day of the party conference in BrightonA protester holds a sign mocking Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Brexit stance at the party conference in BrightonActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightonDelegates take part in an informal vote on Labour\u0027s Brexitr stance at the party conference in BrightonShadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry leads a march in support of a second referendum on BrexitAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonExtinction RebelliActivists from anti-climate change movement Extinction Rebellion march on the Labour conference in BrightononExtinction Rebellion activists march on the Labour conference in BrightonA delegate arrives carrying a briefing from the Labour Representation Committee to the Labour party conference in BrightonProminent anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray protests on Brighton beach during the Labour party conferenceAnti-Brexit protesters take part in a People\u0027s Vote rally during the Labour party conference in BrightonActivists raise a banner calling for the Labour party to restore the original Clause 4 of its constitution, which would pledge the party to nationalising all industryOne Labour\u0026nbspRemainer\u0026nbspsaid: “It was the grassroots against the party machine and the machine won.”Remain-backers’ hopes were boosted earlier in the day when a string of trade unions, led by the country’s largest union Unison, came out in favour of a motion tabled by more than 80 constituency Labour parties, calling for the party to campaign “energetically” for continued EU membership in any referendum.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer left little doubt where his sympathies lay, telling delegates moments before the vote: “I have a very simple message today: if you want a referendum – Vote Labour. If you want a Final Say on Brexit – Vote Labour. If you want to fight for Remain – Vote Labour. Labour will let the people decide”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s what the Labour Party does.”Sir Keir said he would continue personally to campaign for Remain, and said that the NEC position represented “quite considerable movement” over the past 12 months.Mr Corbyn’s plan, approved by a show of hands, envisages a Labour government negotiating a “credible”\u0026nbspBrexit deal within three months of taking power, with the UK remaining in the EU’s customs union and maintaining a close single market relationship, while safeguarding European-style workplace, environmental and consumer protections.The plan commits Labour to a referendum within six months, but leaves the question of which side the party would take to be decided at a special conference after the election. Starmer announced that Labour would legislate to fix the date of the referendum\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp”immediately” after taking office.Following the vote, close Corbyn ally Ms Abbott said: “The message is –\u0026nbspdespite the chatter from commentators –\u0026nbspthe party is determined to unite behind its leader.”But Michael Chessum of the pro-EU Another Europe Is Possible group, which drafted the Remain motion, said:\u0026nbsp”Labour members, 90 per cent of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision. It is possible that the Remain motion had a majority in the constituency Labour parties, but because there was no card vote we will never know.”Mr Chessum said it was “not too late\u0026nbspfor Labour to make clear that it opposes Brexit outright”.“Though it is not the policy we supported, the calling of a special conference to democratically decide Labour’s Brexit policy was a concession which we won,” he said. “But a fudge is not a unity position. It is deeply isive among members, and risks losing a large chunk of our voter base.”Andrew Lewin, founder of Remain Labour, said “We were told the Labour Party would embrace democracy, but today it was the grassroots against the party machine – and the machine won.“If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away. It simply isn’t viable to be ‘neutral’ on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, whose own party committed to revoking Brexit at its conference last week, said:\u0026nbsp“Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country. Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.”Ms Sturgeon tweeted: “Labour rejects a clear pro-Remain position and instead stays firmly perched on the Brexit fence... It beggars belief – from a practical and principled point of view – that Corbyn thinks he can go through a General Election without saying if he backs Remain or Leave. The SNP’s\u0026nbspposition is unequivocally Stop Brexit.”Labour’s mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “I\u0026nbspdo not believe this decision reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members who desperately want to stop Brexit. Labour is\u0026nbspa Remain party. I will continue campaigning with London Labour to give the public the Final Say and stop Brexit.”Labour MP Ian Murray, a prominent campaigner for Remain,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It’s important to recognise that we now have a policy of a public vote on any deal with the option to Remain. That’s really the only show in town.“But it is of course deeply disappointing that we have not chosen to campaign for Remain at this stage, as that certainly does not reflect the strong views of the overwhelming majority of our members and supporters.“It is simply not tenable for our leadership to be neutral when we face the biggest crisis our country has witnessed in modern times.”And Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “After the climate crisis, the biggest issue we face – and Labour refuses to take a side. At a time when we need a strong opposition more than ever, they’ve left the pitch. This is a tragedy for our politics and our country.”Mr\u0026nbspCleverly said: “Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have once again dodged making any decision on Brexit, proving yet again all they offer is more of the same – more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It was said the DUP has agreed to a move that could pave the way for a Brexit deal.The Times reported the party accepted some changes that would see Northern Ireland sticking to some European Union rules post-Brexit.But it would be a new deal to replace the hard Irish backstop, a sticking point for many in the Brexit negotiations.The paper claimed the DUP, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, had also privately said it would drop its objection to regulatory checks in the Irish Sea.A point it had previously said was unacceptable as it would separate Northern Ireland politically and economically from the mainland.Boris Johnson said any move to block a No Deal Brexit would weaken his hand in attempting to negotiate an agreement with Brussels.If MPs backed a bill that would force him to seek an extension to our leaving datethere was no deal, then he would seek a general election.After they did just that, the Prime Minister followed suit with a motion seeking the two-thirds majority needed to go to the polls on October But  MPs backed him - far short of  MPs he needed to get it through.Earlier in the week, addressing the nation outside Number  on Monday, September , the Prime Minister insisted: I dont want an election, you dont want an election.”He said thatMPs voted to block the option of a No Deal Brexit they would plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position when he is negotiating.The vote was lost after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to abstain in the knowledge this would prevent Boris getting the two thirds majority he needed.That prompted a furious Mr Johnson brand Corbyn chicken saying he was “the first leader of the opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation of an election”.Labour’s mass abstention came despite Mr Corbyn and other senior figures in his party having called for a general election as soon as possible more than  times so far — in this year alone."},{"url":null,"title":"mythical monsters loch ness bigfoot goat sucker","story":"But there have been hundreds of other sightings of terrying monsters around the world whose legitimacy is still being questioned.One such beast is the Honey Island Swamp Monster in Louisiana.The horric creature is said to look like a seven-foot man with grey hair and yellow eyes, who reeks of a disgusting smell.It became famous in America in  when large webbed footprints were found by the swamp near the body of a wild boar whose throat had been ripped open.And incredibly, images which some claim show the monster were found on a reel of Super  film belonging to a wildle photographer — but they only came to light after the photographers death.Sceptics say the footage is just a hoax — but sightings of some other beasts have never been explained.Name: Bigfoot SasquatchLocation: Pacic Northwest, USAAppearance: Giant ape-like man covered in fur with enormous feetBigfoot or Sasquatch is probably one of the best-known mythical creatures on Earth, with chilling sightings of the beast dating back at least to the late nineteenth century.The creature is said to be a huge, muscular gorilla-like animal between six and nine feet tall and covered in dark hair.Its name comes from large footprints which were discovered by a bulldozer operator in Bluff Creek, about  miles north of San Francisco, in .Even though it was later revealed that the footprints were a hoax, people still believe in the monster.Bluff Creek is also where the famous grainy video clip of Bigfoot was shot in , which has been the subject of a raging debate between enthusiasts and sceptics ever since.It was even revealed in  that more Americans believe in Bigfoot than the Big Bang Theory as theres been over , recorded sightings.Last year, conspiracy theorists went berserk for a video recorded in the Canadian wilderness which they claimed proved that Bigfoot was real.Name: ChupacabraLocation: All over the world, first seen in Puerto RicoAppearance: Varies, but usually some kind of dog-like body with a spiny backChupacabra, which literally means goat-sucker in Spanish, is a monster said to drink the blood of livestock animals.The first sighting was revealed in Puerto Rico in  when Madelyne Tolentino says she saw a creature with black eyes, the skin of a reptile and spines running down its back.She caught a horric glance of the beast in Canóvanas when  pets and farm animals were killed by a mystery predator in August.In most cases, the animals had been completely drained of their blood through small puncture wounds in their chests.Since then reports of the Chupacabra have cropped up all around the globe including in India, Russia and the Philippines.In , pitchfork-wielding villagers in Ukraine claimed to have killed the vampire-like beast.One local, Ivan, said he slayed the monster while it was raiding his barn.He said: The Chupacabra was hunting and I killed it.It had been scaring local people for a long time. It was eating our chickens and rabbits.Name: Champ ChampyLocation: Lake Champlain, USA and CanadaAppearance: Massive water snakeNessie isnt the only lake-based monster to capture the imagination of terried locals.Champ or Champy is a giant monster said to swim beneath the surface of Lake Champlain, which is split between New York, Vermont and Quebec.Over  sightings have been made of Champ, with the first recorded in .A sailor named Captain Crum said he saw an enormous serpentine monster which he reckoned to be around  feet long with three teeth and eyes the colour of peeled onions.He added that the creature had a belt of red around its neck and a white star on its forehead.P.T. Barnum, the historical figure played by Hugh Jackman in The Greatest Showman, even offered a reward to whoever brought him the monster.Interest in the lake snake exploded in  when Sandra Mansi snapped a picture of a huge creature sticking out of the water, and dozens of other images supposedly of Champ have been captured since.In , an article was published in a peer-reviewed scientic journal describing the discovery of sound measurements in the lake consistent with killer and beluga whales — neither of which are known to live in Lake Champlain.Name: Underwater panther MishipeshuLocation: Michipicoten Island and Great Lakes, CanadaAppearance: Scaly lynx with a spiked spineThe underwater panther or Mishipeshu is one of the most important mythical beings to the indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands around the Great Lakes in the USA and Canada.It has the head and claws of a giant Lynx-like cat, but has scales all over its body and has sharp spikes along its tail and back.The underwater panther is known for guarding huge copper reserves in the Great Lakes, with the copper on Michipicoten Island considered especially sacred property of the beast.A seventeenth century missionary called Claude Dablon told a tale of four Ojibwe people all being ripped apart by the underwater panther for taking its precious metal.Name: RompoLocation: Africa and IndiaAppearance: Skeletal body with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bearRompo is one of the strangest mythical creatures reported anywhere in the world.Its thought to have the head of a hare but with human ears on top a of a skeleton-like body, dragging itself around with the arms of a badger and the legs of a bear.Most disturbing of all, it only feeds on human corpses, making a soft low noise as it does so.When it finds a body, witnesses claim it circles the dead person several times before it begins feasting.Its also claimed that the Rompos skin changes colour, turning green when it moves among bushes and trees.Although sceptics think the Rompo is actually an old world porcupine, encounters with the beast have been logged in both India and across Africa.Name: Jersey Devil Leeds DevilLocation: New Jersey, USAAppearance: Goat-headed flying beast with hooves and the wings of a batThe Jersey Devil or Leeds Devil is a terrying bat-winged kangeroo-like creature with the head of a goat and cloven hooves.Its said that the devil moves quickly and cries with a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.The legend of the Jersey Devil began in , when New Jersey resident Jane Leeds cursed the baby in her womb when she found out she was pregnant for the thirteenth time.Then, on the stormy night when the child was born, it changed rapidly from a normal baby into a nightmare creature with a forked tail.Witnesses present at the horric event claimed the devil child screamed and growled before flying up the chimney and off into the woods.And then  years later, in , hundreds of sightings were reported in local newspapers about sightings and attacks of the Jersey Devil.Cops say they shot at it without effect and schools were closed in the Delaware Valley because of the widespread fear and panic.At the time, vigilante groups even took up arms to rid their communities of the beast.The fearsome legend lives on in the terrying -storey Jersey Devil rollercoaster set to open at Six Flags in New Jersey next year."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas slashies multiple jobs","story":"The growing trend sees people work in multiple jobs — and   its name originates from how they describe themselves, such as “I’m a blogger dog walker waiter”.A record , of us are now estimated to be slashiesInstead of freelancers, who tend to work  in a single industry, “side hustlers” who have a main job then make money from a hobby on the side, slashies deliberately choose to work a few days or even hours in multiple roles in dferent sectors.Experts claim this avoids the pressures of searching for a single  “ideal” role and provides job satisfaction by avoiding office politics and keeps work options open.But slashies risk burnout by trying to do too many jobs at once.Amanda Augustine, career advice expert at TopCV, explains: “They can be nimbler when adapting to changes in the job market.“Instead of  one career — and one narrow set of job opportunities — slashies can cast a wider net using their erse skills and experience.“If you’re interested in pursuing the slashie lestyle, start by listing what you enjoy doing and do well.“What  were your favourite ­subjects in school and why   Do you have any hobbies you wish you could turn into a job  Which jobs have you most enjoyed and why “This will help you create a shortlist of potential career paths you can then research.”The -year-old, from Farnborough, Hants, said: “The best thing about being a slashie is the quality of le.“I work very hard, but I choose the best times to work.“Rather than being stuck at my desk from -

Corbyn hasn’t committed to either side. In an interview yesterday, he refused to answer the question EIGHT TIMES.So, we are in the absurd position of a man running to be Prime Minister not being able to say where he would stand on the biggest issue facing the country in decades.Little wonder that more than three quarters of voters are dissatisfied with his performance.Corbyn is betting that he can quarantine the issue of Brexit. His strategy is to offer a second referendum then fight a general election on classic Left Right lines.The problem with this plan is that British politics is so dominated by Brexit that you HAVE to have an answer on that before you can talk about anything .Is Jeremy Corbyn really intending to spend the entire election campaign refusing to say how he would vote in the referendum he is calling for Corbyn’s equivocation is a particular problem, given the clarity in the other parties’ positions.The Lib Dem conference agreed this week thatthe party won a majority in a general election — stop sniggering at the back — they would simply revoke Article .This clear policy is helping them scoop up more and more Remainer votes. One poll this week had them overtaking Labour and pulling in support from more than  per cent of those who backed Remain in .If the Lib Dems get anywhere near this level of support in a general election, then Labour will lose seats to BOTH the Lib Dems and the Tories.As one gleeful Cabinet minister points out, the Lib Dem position “shines a spot-light on Labour’s ambiguity”.Many in the Shadow Cabinet are worried about Corbyn’s refusal to say where he stands. Many of them want Labour to state clearly that it is the party of Remain.Expect an effort at next week’s Labour conference to change the party’s position to make it clear that as a party Labour WILL IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES campaign for Remain in a second referendum.The other problem with Corbyn’s position is that it means this whole debate will just drag on. Another negotiation with Brussels followed by another referendum would take at least six months, and maybe more.This isn’t going to be popular with an electorate that wants this issue resolved so the country can move on and start addressing the domestic issues voters care about most.At the last election, Corbyn managed to skilfully straddle the Brexit ide.He hoovered up the votes of Remainers but with a manesto that promised to respect the referendum result, held on to heavily Leave-supporting seats too.It will be far harder,not impossible, for Corbyn to pull off that trick again. The danger for him is that his fence-sitting ends up alienating both groups.AT his book launch, David Cameron told the assembled guests that he had tried to avoid writing too much about scandals in the memoir.But he did remember when a Tory peer got caught up in an SM sting early in his leadership.It was put to him that he should remove the whip, to which Cameron replied: “Shouldn’t we take the handcuffs off too ”“WHAT was he thinking ’ one loyal, long-time supporter of David Cameron declared to me after the former PM revealed how he had worked behind the scenes to get the Queen to make an intervention in the Scottish independence referendum.The Palace is understandably cross about the revelation, which undermines the Queen’s political neutrality.One Whitehall source tells me the Palace are “apoplectic” about it and can’t understand why a former Prime Minister would break such an important confidence in such a pre-meditated way.Belatedly, Cameron seems to have realised the trouble he’s caused – refusing to answer further questions on it for TV.But as someone who has worked for three Tory leaders tells me: “It is one of the weirdest unforced errors I have ever seen.”As part of efforts to deal with this problem, Operation Anson has been launched. This week, the team involved arrested  people on suspicion of involvement in this activity after targeting  marinas and harbours.The test of this surge in enforcement activity will be whether it stamps out this vile trade before more people perish in the Channel.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition.

He quit Labour to be an independent MP in February over the “culture of extremism and intolerance” created by Mr Corbyn.Today Mr Austin launches cross-party campaign group Mainstream, aimed at combating extremism in public le.He said: “I grew up listening to my father, a Holocaust refugee, warning of the dangers of prejudice and hatred.“I joined Labour as a teenager and campaigned for it all my adult le.“But the party of today is not the one I grew up in.“Under Jeremy Corbyn it has been poisoned by a culture of extremism and intolerance. It is the responsibility of everyone who opposes extremism in all its forms to stand up against this destructive force.”The poll found  per cent are proud of Britain’s history over the past  years, with  per cent “ashamed”.Only  per cent believe in retaining the monarchy while  per cent want a republic.Twenty per cent would be “happy” or “proud” to sing the anthem but half would be “bored, embarrassed or angry”.More members,  per cent, blame the Government for the atrocities of the Troubles than blame Republican terrorists like the IRA .Just  per cent think groups like al-Qaeda are the most to blame for Islamist terrorist attacks in the UK. A total of  per cent think the UK and its allies are most to blame, while  per cent blame both sides equally.Meanwhile  per cent support using strikes to overthrow a Conservative government.A huge  per cent agree with getting rid of Britain’s nuclear weapons. Almost half,  per cent, want to abolish our country’s borders.A total of  per cent support new laws limiting who owns national newspapers. And  per cent say a Labour government should take more control of broadcast media.We stand up to extremism, racism and prejudice. That’s the British way.Sun readers expect their government to defend their country abroad, maintain their security at home and keep their streets safe. They certainly don’t expect a party which might be in power in just a few weeks to tear itself to pieces in the way Labour has done in the last  hours.Tom Watson has given the party he loves decades of service. But because the extremists who now control Labour don’t trust him to bow to all of their demands, they tried to abolish his job while he was at home looking after his son.Mainstream is a new campaign to stand up for these values and warn people of the dangers of extremism.We will promote respectable and responsible politics wherever we can, and we will oppose extremism - wherever it comes from.We’ll oppose extremism on the far left or the hard right, and today we are highlighting the impact of a government led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left.I thought I knew how badly Jeremy Corbyn had poisoned the Labour Party.I quit after  years as a member to shine a spotlight on the extremism and racism.But even I was shocked by this new poll showing what Labour members now actually think.Under Corbyn, half say they would be bored, embarrassed or angryasked to sing the National Anthem.Just  per cent are proud of our country’s history. Almost three times as many are ashamed.More than six out of ten want to abolish the monarchy and more of them blame the British Government and our brave army than the IRA and other republican terrorists for the violent troubles in Northern Ireland.Almost half want to abolish our country’s borders and nearly seven out of ten members think it would be ok for trade unions to hold a general strike to remove a Conservative Government.More than half either blame the media or Jeremy Corbyn’s political opponents for the allegations of racism against Jewish people instead of the members responsible or the leadership that has allowed it to happen.Sixty-nine per cent of Labour members now blame Western Governments instead of Terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS for Islamist terrorist attacks on the streets of Britain or think they are equally to blame as groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS!You would never have got results like that under previous Labour leaders, but the Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left is completely outside Britain’s mainstream political traditions. They can’t be trusted to uphold our country’s values or safeguard the institutions on which our democracy depends.Corbyn’s supporters claim he is ing the party to its socialist roots, but it’s just not true.Clement Attlee’s great post-war government established the NHS and the Welfare State, but he was a proud British patriot who set up NATO, insisted on Britain having nuclear weapons and booted communists out of the party.There are still decent people in the Labour Party, fighting for common-sense, but good MPs have been targeted, smeared or driven out and all sorts of people from the fringes of politics have joined to support Jeremy Corbyn.All this explains why we are setting up Mainstream, a new campaign - led by a group of people from dferent political backgrounds – to encourage ato respectable and responsible politics, and to banish extremism from British politics once and for all.To lead Britain, you must love this country, but Jeremy Corbyn is the opposite of a patriot. He could not be trusted with our national security or to defend our country. At every available opportunity, he has backed Britain’s enemies, whether that’s the IRA at the height of the Troubles or groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.No previous Labour leadership would have supported dictatorships in Cuba or Venezuela or have sided with the Russian dictator’s line on Ukraine or when his killers used chemical weapons to bring death to Salisbury. The hard-left think that wealth is the problem and the people who create it the enemy. A government led by Jeremy Corbyn would see John McDonnell in the Treasury, but our economy has never before been run by someone who says he wants to overthrow capitalism or says Marx, Lenin and Trotsky are his most signicant influences.Jeremy Corbyn surrounds himself and works with people from the far-left fringes of politics and they could not be trusted to respect and uphold the independence of our civil service, the impartiality and fairness of our broadcasters or the freedom of the press.It is a disgrace that he and the people around him have allowed a party with a fine tradition of fighting for fairness and equality to be poisoned by racism against Jewish people.Under Corbyn, mainstream ideas are being replaced by views that are wildly out of step with the views of the general public. Extremism is rearing its way back into the public discourse in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.We encourage everyone who wants to support our country’s mainstream values in political and public le to join us. The left-wing grassroots body — set up just weeks after Corbyn won his  leadership contest — now has , members. It was based on the Syriza movement in Greece and Podemos in Spain, both of which  also fought against austerity measures.Cambridge graduate Lansman, , tried to run the party machine last year by mounting a failed bid to replace  out- going Iain McNicol as general secretary.

Labour will let the people decide.He said this evening he was disappointed the party had voted to hold off on a decision but was confident the party would back Remain later.I think most people will realise that the Labour Party membership is so overwhelmingly in favour of Remain, it’s obvious where this will end up, he told Politico.But Lib Dem boss Jo Swinson said he was a secret Brexiteer and refused to show leadership.She stormed: Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country.Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of the Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.JEREMY Corbyns plan passed through Labours annual conference today.It will call a second referendum within six months of getting into power -they ever do.The party will spend thre months trying to get a new Brexit deal with the EU.And they will then have a special conference to decide whether to campaign for or against it in a second referendum.Mr Corbyn could also give his shadow cabinet a free vote on the issue, meaning they could campaign however they liked.Unions Unite and GMB saved Mr Corbyns skin by backing his plan this evening.Unites Len McCluskey told conference: Please give Jeremy the support he needs later.But Unison OPPOSED Labours ruling bodys motion - in a huge break with tradition which could have tipped the balance towards Remain.Earlier today MP Stephen Kinnock joked that Labour has had more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra.The Aberavon MP described the first few days of the conference as utter shambles and slammed the partys move away from respecting the referendum.Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency, he said.Momentum boss Jon Lansman blasted: I’m incredibly disappointed with the process by which today’s NEC statement on Brexit was produced. There was no meeting, no discussion, no consultation with the membership.And Tories immediately launched into their confusing Brexit stance.Jake Berry MP said: Labour will negotiate a new Brexit deal, then hold a special conference to decide which side to back.Theyll then ignore the  referendum and hold another, where theyll either support Remain, the deal theyve negotiated or stay neutral.Got it  🤔Jeremy Corbyn launched into a huge rant this morning as he crumbled under Brexit pressure.The Labour boss raged at the media just hours before the crucial showdown.As he was followed by reporters this morning Mr Corbyn shouted: This is our conference, these are our stalls!Your behaviour, pushing past people, pushing people over and pushing people who want to visit stalls, is totally unacceptable!And he blasted: I’m asking you to behave with respect to our members and our conference.It comes after he snapped repeatedly at BBC boss Andrew Marr yesterday during an interview.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said this morning: I think people should express their own judgement on this.There will be some who think we can get adeal, but there will be others like myself who think you cannot get a better deal than Remain.If the Labour boss had lost it would have been a huge blow to his authority.Andrew Gwynne Shadow Communities Secretary told Radio s Westminster Hour last night that the shadow cabinet have been told by Jeremy Corbyn that they can campaign as they want on Brexit in a future referendum - just like in the  EU vote."},{"url":null,"title":"steve irwin family feud joy bob australia zoo","story":"The Crocodile Hunter star died in Batt Reef, Australia, after a stingrays barb pierced his heart.Joy says she would have spoken about the rt earlier, but there was a confidentiality agreement stopping her from doing so.But since it has now lapsed, Joy told the Daily Mail, the state of her familys current relationship is very sad.She added: I keep away from all that.

Epstein, who is a hair transplant specialist and facial plastic surgeon in Miami, Florida, told his office to be prepared for the inevitable calls and emails.At least  people have made comments in recent months, the plastic surgeon told Gen.Medium.He added that his -year-old daughter got a hard stare and look of empathy when she borrowed his credit card.Epsteins death came two weeks after he was placed on suicide watch when he was found nearly unconscious in his cell with injuries to his neck.Law enforcement officials confirmed on August  he had taken his own le at politan Correctional Center in Manhattan, which is where he had been held without bail pending trial on child sex-trafficking charges.Chief Medical Examiner Dr Barbara Sampson announced on August  that the death was a suicide.She said she made the determination after careful review of all investigative information, including complete autopsy findings”.Epsteins autopsy revealed that the financier had multiple broken neck bones, often consistent with strangulation.When the paedo was found dead in his cell, the Arizona businessman tweeted: Its been an amusing morning having @JeffreyEpstein as my Twitter handle.Pretty surreal to have my name tagged next to words like death, suicide, rapist, pedophile, monster etc.... The other Jeffrey Epstein was a despicable human being and as far as I am concerned good riddance!Hopefully the truth still comes out about his actions but I look forward to my name becoming more obscure as the news of his crimes and death passes over time."},{"url":null,"title":"thomas cook air hostess instagram","story":"Chloe Bain, , who built up , Instagram followers, is one of the , employees, including , in the UK , left jobless after the holiday firm collapsed.It wasnt just a job for me it was something I loved,” she said.It was my dream job because I had found a job I had fell in love with.

The usual rep hasn’t turned up today.“Last night we were told everything would be OK, but now everything seems far from OK.“I’m sure we won’t kick anyone out on the street but we might ask people to pay for their rooms.

The mission is expected to cost around £m and will be met by the British government.Diane and Geoff Haslam, from Bolton, arrived from New York on the first repatriation flight to land at Manchester airport.Geoff said: We checked in as normal but only found out about the news five minutes before we departed, when the Thomas Cook staff told us.“I feel so sorry for the staff but they carried on working through the flight even though their job was gone. It was quite a relaxing flight and we were relieved to be able to get home.“I think the bosses should pay back their bonuses to the staff, seeing as they owe them this month’s wages.”Geoff and Ann Clfe, from Cheshire, had just arrived from Split, Croatia, on the second repatriation flight to land at Manchester.Geoff said the lack of communication was very poor and they were so glad to be home.Mick Fraser and his we Maria, from East Grinstead in West Sussex, touched down at Gatwick shortly after pm -  hours later than planned.But the -year-old Tube driver praised the staffs professionalism, saying: The reps were good as gold, they kept us fully informed. You cant fault the Thomas Cook local reps.Elsewhere there were scenes of chaos as Brits waited in airports across the globe for information, some missing weddings, honeymoons and dream holidays.The -year-old British travel firm had until .pm last night to pay the £m it owed its creditors or  theyd go under.The company’s , employees, including , in the UK, have been made redundant.Travellers expecting to board Thomas Cook planes in the UK today were told to stay at home as ALL flights are grounded permanently.What we know so far...Announcing it was ceasing trading, Thomas Cook said on its website: All future flights and holidays are cancelled.The brief statement added: A dedicated support service is being provided by The Civil Aviation Authority to assist customers overseas and those in the UK with future bookings.Worried customers were asked to visit www.thomascook.caa for more information - although the site has crashed several times.Devastated Thomas Cook staff spoke of their heartbreak at the firms collapse today and told of their dream job going in the blink of an eye.Have you been affected  If so please email thomas.burrows@thesun or call    A passenger one of the last flights to land at London Gatwick this morning said they felt emotional for Thomas Cook staff.She said: Some of the cabin crew looked like they’d had a little cry.

It is expected to cost the taxpayer up to £ million.Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the liquidation of Thomas Cook as a very dficult situation and vowed his Government would do its level best to get Brit holidaymakers home.The CAA warned: Due to the signicant scale of the situation, some disruption is inevitable.The watchdog added in a statement that it will endeavour to get people home as close as possible to their planned dates.It was unclear what will happen to the firms , foreign customers now stranded in resorts around the world.Mike Churcher, , who is currently on a Thomas Cook package holiday with his we and -year-old son at the Royal Wings hotel in Antalya, Turkey, said he feared being thrown out of his hotel.He told the : “There’s no information. It’s all very stoic – we’re all stf upper lip, they’re all tight-lipped...we don’t think they’ve been paid for our holiday [by Thomas Cook] yet so we’re worried they may throw us out. The Royal Wings staff are being very nice now though.Transport Secretary Grant Schapps added: Thomas Cook’s collapse is very sad news for staff and holidaymakers.The Government and UK CAA is working round the clock to help people.Our contingency planning has helped acquire planes from across the world - some from as far away as Malaysia - and we have put hundreds of people in call centres and at airports.But the task is enormous, the biggest peacetime repatriation in UK history.So there are bound to be problems and delays.He said he was not convinced a £ million public bailout would have saved the travel agent.He told the BBC: I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate them in any case.Q: I only bought Thomas Cook flights. Am I still protected A: No. Unfortunately, only package holiday customers are covered by the company’s Atol licence. Rival airlines may offer special rescue fares.Q: I am on a Thomas Cook holiday and my hotel is insisting I pay them again. What do I do A: Refuse to pay. You have already paid Thomas Cook. The hotelier will have to apply via Atol.Q: I have booked a Thomas Cook holiday  What happens now theyve gone bust A: Anyone who has booked a package holiday is also covered by Atol and can apply to the CAA for their money back.A Thomas Cook plane was “seized” at Manchester Airport with a “Notice of Detention of Aircraft” for non-payment of airport charges.Thomas Cooks chief executive Peter Fankhauser said his company had worked exhaustively to salvage a rescue package.He said the tour operators collapse was a matter of profound regret as he apologised to the companys millions of customers, and thousands of employees.Thomas Cook - which began in  with a one-day train excursion in England - failed to convince lenders to cut the money it owed to see them through the winter period.The devastating news came after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab insisted none of the , holidaymakers currently abroad with the tour giant would be left stranded.But he sparked trade union fury by signalling the Government would NOT be pumping in a £million bailout.He said: We don’t systematically step in with taxpayers’ money when businesses are going under unless there’s a good strategic interest for doing so.Sources told The Sun that Ministers had been working with the aviation watchdog on contingency plans for weeks.The salvage scenario has been dubbed Operation Matterhorn.One insider said: “We’re readywe’re needed. The key is that not everyone will have to come home straight awayit comes to that.People will be able to finish their holidays.The Government’s desperate hunt for spare jumbos has been harder by the forced grounding of the Boeing  Max over safety fears.Worried holidaymakers spent yesterday frantically trying to work outthey would be booted out of their hotel – as creditors and directors thrashed out last-ditch survival plans.Guests at one hotel in Tunisia were allegedly locked in by security guards as staff demanded extra money – worried they won’t be paid by Thomas Cook.Ryan Farmer, from Leicestershire, said the hotel had on Saturday afternoon summoned all guests who were due to leave to go to reception “to pay additional fees”.With many tourists refusing to pay on the grounds they had already paid Thomas Cook, security guards were keeping the hotels gates shut, refusing to allow guests out, or to let new visitors enter.We cant leave the hotel. Id describe it as exactly the same as being held hostage, Mr Farmer said.Furious Labour MPs and union leaders demanded Ministers save the holiday giant – claiming the cost of the company going bust would run above £ million in redundancy and pension costs.Critics said the Government appeared to have learned nothing since the Monarch collapse in .Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said today it was the Conservatives ideological bias against state intervention that prevented the Government acting.Pilots union Balpa yesterday: Thomas Cook is at the last chance saloon today and decisions about staff and passengers are being taken in secret.Its a much bigger scale than Monarch.There is a real risk thatthe worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowingthey have a job or will even get paid for this month.“It is a matter of profound regret to me and the rest of the board that we were not successful.I would like to apologise to our millions of customers, and thousands of employees, suppliers and partners who have supported us for many years.Despite huge uncertainty over recent weeks, our teams continued to put customers first, showing why Thomas Cook is one of the best-loved brands in travel.“Generations of customers entrusted their family holiday to Thomas Cook because our people kept our customers at the heart of the business and maintained our founder’s spirit of innovation.“This marks a deeply sad day for the company which pioneered package holidays and made travel possible for millions of people around the world.”"},{"url":null,"title":"greta thunberg world leaders un climate speech","story":"In impassioned speech at the UN climate action summit, the -year-old said they had “stolen my dreams” with their “empty words”.She told delegates they would never be forgiventhey failed to tackle rising temperaturesThe teenager, who travelled to the US by yacht to avoid flying, said she should not be up on stage, but should be in school on the other side of the ocean.You come to us young people for hope - how dare you  You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words,” she said,People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth.

Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save.

The Duke and Duchess left their four-month-old son behind as they attended their first engagement of the -day trip, visiting the township Nyanga - which is known as the countryaposs murder capital. Even though he wasnapost at the event, which was filled with traditional music and dancing, the royal tot was still in everyoneaposs thoughts and he was even presented with a new name during the celebrations. The communityaposs grandmothers picked a traditional South African Xhosa name for little Archie - Ntsika.   Jessica Dewhurst, executive director of Justice Desk, the charity Meghan and Harry were visiting, told Town  Country that itaposs normal for visitors to be given a traditional name when they arrive in the township.She told the magazine: The reason we chose that was mostly because Archie means the same thing that Ntsika does. So Archie means strength, it means bravery and the South African equivalent of that is Ntsika. When you get your traditional name it’s what you will look up to be. So when they give you a name it’s your wish for you and your future. Even though we havenapost officially seen little Archie yet, we did see snaps of him arriving at the airport with his parents.    Carried by mum Meghan, he looked adorable in a white bobble hat when they stepped off the plane in Cape Town at .am this morning local time. The Duchess was wearing white trousers and a loose shirt, covered by a light grey coat with her hair tied up in a neat bun, while Harry looked happy and relaxed smiling broadly in a grey blazer with dark trousers and a white shirt. Archie is making history today as he becomes the youngest ever member of the Royal Family to go on an official tour, taking the title from his cousin Prince George.  As well as watching performances from local people and having a quick dance with women dressed in traditional costume, Meghan and Harry both gave moving speeches. Meghan praised the work the organisation has been doing, and said she was visiting on a personal level as well as in her role as a member of the Royal Family. She said: I want you to know that for me I am here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister.  I am here with you and I am here for you and I thank you so much for showing my husband and I the spirit of Ubuntu and I look forward to our time over the next few days together. When it was Harryaposs turn on the microphone he spoke about his love for South Africa, menaposs treatment of women and being a role model for Archie.

Christopher Beddallaposs taste for the luxurious le is feared to have cost the jobs of  staff. A court heard how the -year-old pilfered company money to whisk his partner off to New York, and treat her to an engagement ring, expensive watches and a British bulldog.He has now been jailed for almost three years over nicking £, worth of company money, reports the Manchester Evening News .The commercial director, who had a company BMW, boasted of having aposthe dream jobapos.    But he stole more than £, from the till after being hired by the owners of construction company Town and County Piling based in Chorley, Lancashire, to take charge of the finances. In just  weeks of employment at the firm, he set up a string of companies in his weaposs name using virtually identical names to the firmaposs suppliers - then transferred stolen money into the bogus firmsapos accounts. Beddall was caught after the firmaposs bank noticed a payment of £,, which appeared to be going to a regular supplier, was going to an account with a dferent number. It emerged he had tried to buy a vintage Suzuki motorbike with £, of company money.His laptop was used to Google the search terms aposinvoice fraud’ aposcountries that don’t extraditeapos aposjobs in Barbados’ ‘jobs in Jamaica’ and ‘speedboats for sale’. Beddall also posted bragging pictures of his le of on Facebook - and bought a private registration plate for his BMW. The total loss to the firm was £,. His we knew nothing of the thefts. At Burnley Crown Court, one of the companyaposs directors, Suzanne Hayes, said Beddallaposs greed had contributed to the loss of  jobs at the firm due the damage to the firmaposs reputation following the scandal. She told the hearing when the thefts were discovered initially it left her shocked and extremely anxious. She was forced to carry out an extensive audit. I personally was extremely stressed, unable to eat or sleep and unable to spend time with my family or in a social situation. There are ongoing tensions in my family which is all caused by Mr Beddall’s manipulative and isive lies to cover his criminal activity. I am unable to trust anyone  and I feel I cannot give his position to anybody, which gives me less time to grow the company. She said she also felt responsible as she had interviewed Beddall and judged him fit for a pivotal senior role. Ms Hayes added that the offending was a contributing factor to the loss of  jobs, affecting the businessapos reputation: Yet we feel like he has been taunting us by showing his extravagant spending on his social media.    The thefts began soon after Beddall took up his post at the firm in June . Arthur Gibson, prosecuting, said Beddall was on a £K salary and had an expense account, a company car and a laptop. The court heard Beddall had signicant access to the companyaposs financial tools, including control of its bank account. The prosecutor told hte court how on September , , while she was on holiday, Mrs Hayes, was contacted by the fraud department of Santander who said the bank had picked up a payment of just over £, to a regular supplier but noticed the banking details had changed. She and a fellow director inspected the companyaposs accounts when she got home and they discovered a number of discrepancies. One transaction showed a payment of more than £, to a motorbike supplier. Mrs Hayes searched Beddallaposs desk and found a piece of paper referring to a Suzuki machine delivered to his home. He was subsequently fired from his post. Beddall, from Warrington, denied theft, attempted theft, and fraud. He claimed his bosses were aware of the transactions, but was convicted after a trial.    He will face a Proceeds of Crime hearing in January. The firm have managed to recoup £,. In mitigation, defence lawyer Charlotte Kenny said: His we is shocked by his convictions and that will impact on her and currently as she cannot financially support herself. Jailing Beddall for two years and  months, Judge Nicholas Barker told him: I find you to be a devious and dishonest inidual and it seems to me that you began your dishonest enterprise with alarming speed. You had what you describe as a aposdream jobapos, one that many aspire to be a aposdream jobapos.

A no-nonsense defender in his time, Parker also helped England to the World Cup semi-final at Italia ’ before that well-documented defeat to Germany characterised by Gazza’s tears. What Parker, now an established broadcaster, seldom talks about is the racist abuse so horric back then that his parents did not go and watch him in a single game. Or the times thousands of fans, home and away, would chant at him: “There ain’t no black in the Union Jack!” among other, far worse insults. Parker broke that silence during the Mirror’s Boot Out Racism event at #Lab. “My parents never watched me play one professional game,” he said. “Not one. “It was not because they didn’t want to come. They were two people who worked very, very hard and mostly wanted to come. But I was scared of what would happensomeone said something in front of them.

It is the reason why the Mirror’s Boot Out Racism campaign has been so important for so long. Footballers don’t just need a vehicle to tell their stories.

The player, who cannot be named for legal reasons, jumped out of the window wearing only his underwear after the two men entered the room. Rowe, from Birmingham, said he agreed to go to the hotel after his friend Tyrone Coleman - a former contestant on ITVaposs Take Me Out - discovered Wood had been contacting the footballer.  He said to me that his girl had some form of contact with the player -they had met on several occasions previously, Rowe told police after his arrest.

He denied taking either the footballeraposs Rolex watch or designer tracksuit, which he was wearing when arrested days after the hotel room incident.

Tyrone Coleman told police Wood was not his girlfriend at the time but they had been seeing each other after meeting on social media. He said Wood revealed she previously met the footballer and had sent him videos and pictures, which he had asked for. I didnapost believe her at first, Tyrone Coleman told police. She said aposheaposs a nice guy, itaposs crazy how footballers live, he has a nice carapos.

As well as watching performances from local people and having a quick dance with women dressed in traditional costume, Meghan and Harry both gave moving speeches. Meghan praised the work the organisation has been doing, and said she was visiting on a personal level as well as in her role as a member of the Royal Family. She said: I want you to know that for me I am here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister.    I am here with you and I am here for you and I thank you so much for showing my husband and I the spirit of Ubuntu and I look forward to our time over the next few days together. When it was Harryaposs turn on the microphone he spoke about his love for South Africa, menaposs treatment of women and being a role model for Archie. He said: No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle. Your strength is in your spirit which for me means honouring and protecting my we and being a positive role model for my son. Here are both of their speeches in full:    Meghanaposs speech in full Hello! It is such privilege to meet all of you today and to start our visit, my first time in South Africa, here in Nyanga. We have just spent some time seeing all the incredible work that the Justice Desk does and of course all of you amazing women and the men who are here helping you, Mbokodo, you are incredible and what you’re doing is so powerful, because you’re all powerful. The work that’s being done here is to keep women and children safer, which is needed now more than ever. This is an issue that’s been at the forefront of people’s minds here in South Africa, and of course across the globe, particularly over this past month. Please know that my husband and I have been closely following what you’ve been experiencing here – as best we can from afar. But now that we are with you, we are eager to learn and see first-hand the work that you’re doing, the vital work that you’re doing, and that everything that is being done on the ground is making the great change that you not only need but that you deserve.    You have welcomed us into this community, have been open and honest with us, both about the dangers women and children face, and about how you are addressing them. The rights of women and girls is something that is very close to my heart, and the cause I have spent the majority of my le advocating for because I know that when women are empowered, the entire community flourishes. So to be able to meet all of you today who are standing up for what’s right in the face of adversity, I applaud you. We are encouraged to hear your President take the next steps to work towards preventing gender-based violence through education and necessary changes to reinforce the values of modern South Africa. I do have to say I feel incredibly humbled to be in the presence of all of you as you stand firm in your core values of respect, dignity and equality. I read a quote a few weeks ago and it resonated with me as I’ve been watching what’s been happening here and your active efforts. Maya Angelou, the legendary poet and civil rights activist, once said: “Each time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it, possibly without claiming it, she stands up for all women.” Now I know it’s not easy and I know it must feel insurmountable at times, but your commitment to what is right gives all of us hope, especially your brothers and sisters here in your community who need you to continue to shine your light brightly. Your commitment is inspiring, it is energising and it is extraordinary. You must keep going, you must know that what you’re doing not only matters, it is vital because YOU are vital.    And just on one personal note, may I just say that while I am here with my husband as a member of The Royal Family, I want you to know that for me I am here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister. I am here with you and I am here FOR you and I thank you so much for showing my husband and I the spirit of Ubuntu and I look forward to our time over the next few days together. Thank you so much for having us. Prince Harryaposs speech Thank you very much for the warm welcome today. It was incredibly important for my we and I to begin our trip here in Nyanga with you so thank you for having us. As someone who has visited this amazing country many times, and as someone who regards Cape Town as a uniquely special place in Africa, I wanted to ensure that our first visit as a family, with my we by my side, focused on the signicant challenges facing millions of South Africans while acknowledging the hope that we feel so strongly here.    We are so incredibly grateful to be able to listen and learn from you about the issues that define your daily lives in these communities. And thataposs what this is: a community. A community where men and women have a vital role to play. Touching on what your president said last week, no man is born to cause harm to women this is learned behaviour and a cycle that needs to be broken. Itaposs about redefining masculinity, itaposs about creating your own footprints for your children to follow in so that you can make a positive change for the future.

The couple seemed delighted to be starting their tour, and neither of them could resist a dance with the members of the community who had turned out to greet them. Meghan and Harry both gave moving speeches during their visit, in which Harry spoke about honouring and protecting his we and being a positive role model for Archie.     Nyanga, which is about  miles from Cape Town, is known as the country’s “murder capital” after recording more murders -  - than any other police precinct in  . Meghan is wearing a £ black and white patterned dress by Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand, with dark wedges. The dress has already sold out online. Harry is in dark trousers and a white shirt.  They were also wearing matching red and white beaded bracelets bearing the word aposJusticeapos, a nod to the charity they are visiting. During their visit both Meghan and Harry gave speeches, and the Duchess told the crowd: When women are empowered the entire community flourishes. You are all powerful. Harry stopped halfway through his speech to go and pick up a picture which flew out the hand of a child sitting in the crowd, before ing to the stage and carrying on. Harry said: “No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle. Your strength is in your spirit which for me means honouring and protecting my we and being a positive role model for my son. Meghan and Harry watched a workshop that teaches children about their rights, self-awareness and safety and provides self-defence classes and female empowerment training to young girls in the community.  Specialist British police have spent months scouting Nyanga to ensure the safety of Harry and Meghan. They are in the township to learn about the work the Justice Desk, a human rights organisation, is doing to support the development of Nyanga township children. The organisation is supported by the Queenaposs Commonwealth Trust, which has Harry as its president and Meghan as vice-president. Jessica Dewhurst, Justice Desk founder, and Theodora Luthuli, a Justice Desk community leader, were hosting the royal visit and Ms Dewhurst took the couple on a tour of ious activities being showcased in the grounds of the church.  Later today, Harry and Meghan will visit a museum dedicated to telling the story of , inhabitants of ious races who were forced to relocate during the apartheid regime in the s. The District Six Museum will be a focal point for the Duke and Duchess to learn about the history of the area and meet former residents. However, the committee which represents  families who have who have fought for decades toto the homes from which they were forcibly removed by the apartheid regime, has slammed the couple saying they have not been invited.    Shahied Ajam, chair of the District Six Working Committee, said: “I’m perplexed that the committee hasn’t been invited.”He called on Prince Harry to apologise for “the monster that his forbears created”.“Prince Harry is a representative of a former colonial power that was the architect of what transpired in District Six. Forced removals and the other apartheid evils had their roots in colonialism. “The English don’t have a good history in South Africa. They enforced and implemented segregation,” he said.    District Six is about “the people and the place, and not about a museum”, said Ajam.Earlier today they were pictured landing at the airport in Cape Town , however their British Airways flight from London Heathrow was delayed.As they stepped of the plane at about .am local time, Meghan was carrying Archie who looked adorable in a white bobble hat.

Meghan spoke during a apossharing sessionapos after watching a self defence class for girls as young as seven living in a township plagued by violence in Cape Town. The demonstration formed part of a community action day run by The Justice Desk, which runs outreach programmes tackling a crisis of violence against women and young girls sweeping South Africa.Meghan spoke of her “deep sense of pride” at the community spirit showed by the youngsters during her first engagement with Prince Harry during their  day tour of the region.   Barely a couple of hours after landing in Cape Town, the royal couple visited the Arts Centre in Nyanga - dubbed the “murder capital” of South Africa. The notorious community has one of the highest murder rates in a country plagued by violence - with one in  dying  each year -  and huge rates of men beating women and girls. Jessica Dewhurst, who founded the award winning human rights organisation, said: “The Duchess said how proud she was of the girls and how amazing she though they all were. “She held everyone’s attention in that moment, the girls were just transfixed.     “After watching the boxing class which we hold as a means of teaching self defence and self worth to the young girls, we all sat in a circle and everyone can choose to share their stories, whatever is on their mind. “Some of them spoke about how they used to fear growing up in Nyanga but now they have an outlet for their fears. “We teach them to be strong and support each other, that they can educate themselves about their worth and in turn educate the men around them to be better iniduals. “When it came to her turn, the Duchess seemed very moved by what she has heard. “She said ‘I admire you all and your strength. If you stay strong and stay true to supporting each other as sisters, you  can go and change the world.    “It was incredible. The girls were inspired. She knew the important of being a mentor to the younger generation and was so in tune with what we are doing here.” Prince Harry also spoke to the male coaches at the Mbokodo Club - which translates to ‘The Rock Club’. The mantra of the group is set upon making girls and young women strong so they stand up to gender violence to give them strength, their motto being “If you strike a woman, you strike a rock”. Jessica said: “Harry also recognised the value of mentoring and really encouraged the guys to go into their communities to get more men involved. “He said ‘because that’s how you make the dference as well, right  Not only working with the girls but educating the men to change their behaviour or to not behave that way in the first place’.    “They both just get it and it means a lot to have the recognition that we are doing something right.” Jessica, , founded the Justice Desk in  has transformed it into an organisation across South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In just a short time it has reached , people through seminars and workshops in schools and community centres. On leaving the Nyanga arts centre, traditional African dancers lined the exit and entertained locals and their special guests. Meghan and Harry stopped to dance with -year-old Lilitha Mazana while laughing and bopping to the tribal beat. She said: “Meghan was a good dancer. She’s very nice and I liked her very much.

Meghan, , appeared to be deeply affected earlier today as she listened to former residents of Cape Town’s inner city District Six neighbourhood recall how they were forced to move into Townships during the apartheid era. She and Harry listened intently as Noor Ebrahim, , and Joe Schaffers, , showed them on a giant floor map where they had been living when the government declared District Six a whites-only area in . “When she realised the enormity of the forced relocations, she was very moved,” Joe said later.  “They had never looked at the psychological aspects of it. So many people have never been able to recover from that. She was really moved by all this and how people are still struggling with unemployment in this country. She felt it and said it was going to take a long time to change things. “Harry said it was true that it would take a long time to heal but I said we had fought against an oppressor before so we would come through in the end. “Our people were affected not only physically but psychologically – many have never recovered, especially the elderly. They lost out on everything.” Referring to the Duchess’s mixed heritage, the retired health inspector said: “I think Meghan could identy with that because of her own family’s past.” Joe was  when he was given notice to leave the neighbourhood. “They moved people out and demolished,” he said. “The destruction of District Six, in my opinion, was nothing more than a form of ethnic cleansing.”  He said of Harry and Meghan’s visit there: “It gives us hope that out there there are still people very concerned about what’s happening in this country and a visit by royals has strengthened that hope. If they go back they might be able to go back and tell people about the positive things that are happening here. He said of the atmosphere outside: “It was like a pop festival out there. The children and the girls were just shouting ‘Harry’, calling him by his name. “Protocol went out of the window! Where ever do you have people being able to hug a member of the royal family, right in front of police  People were hugging them and they were hugging back, not pulling back.

Although Her Majesty undoubtedly puts in a fair amount of hard graft and is still holding down a job at -years-old, being a monarch has its perks. With house prices having roughly tripled in the UK since , arguably top of the pile is the property portfolio afforded to the Queen - including, but not limited to, Windsor Castle, Kensington Palace and Sandringham House. To sweeten the deal further, Elizabeth II is worth an estimated £ million and benefited from a £. million sovereign grant courtesy of the tax payer this year. While bags of cash and big homes are privileges she shares with other high net worth iniduals, Her Majesty enjoys one perk no one  in the UK does. The Queen is the only person in the country who is allowed to drive without a licence.    Along with her ability to form a government and bestow honours on members of the public, the head of state can and does drive the roads of Britain without having passed her test.As much as Her Majestyaposs competence in the wheel has not been called into question - with David Cameron implying the Queen was a dab hand when it came to car control in his new book - a further perk ensures she is free from legal reproach.Unlike every other driver in the UK, the royal is not required to drive with a number plate.    The Queenaposs demeanour when in the driving seat was the subject of a story earlier this year. According to Shepard Cowper-Coles, a former British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, in  the countryaposs then king Abdullah had a fright when he jumped in the passenger seat while visiting Balmoral.

Thomas Cook was founded in  and was one of the the worldaposs oldest travel companies. They operated in around  high street stores across the country and employed , employees at its Lynch Wood headquarters in Peterborough.    The news came after Peterborough MP and former Thomas Cook employee Lisa Forbes urged the government to save the jobs at risk. In a passionate statement, released on Friday she said: I am deeply concerned about the news that Peterboroughaposs Thomas Cook is on the verge of collapseit cannot find an extra £m in funding. Having worked for Thomas Cook myself, my thoughts are with the , employees here in the city whose jobs and livelihoods are at risk and the additional , staff employed worldwide.  A few months before Christmas, I canapost begin to imagine the worry faced by many in the city today. These are good, hard-working people who deserve better. It is vital that the management are in regular discussions with trade unions and employees on how jobs can be protected and on the state of play financially. Lisa Forbes earlier today passed on her immediate thoughts to those facing redundancy.

They also face a probe into their conduct in the years before the travel giant collapsed yesterday. It is expected to mean all , staff losing their jobs and thousands more among its suppliers. Directors at Britain’s oldest travel agency received £million in pay and perks in the past  years. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “They have a moral responsibility totheir bonuses.    “They created this mess and there are large numbers of people losing their jobs. [Bosses] should hand the money back to compensate those workers.” The firm’s rivals are being accused of taking advantage of the collapse by hiking prices by hundreds of pounds.As the Government began the biggest peace-time repatriation – with an estimated , Brits stranded abroad after the company’s demise – Boris Johnson stopped short of demanding the bonuses be paid back.The Prime Minister said: “It’s not possible for me to know exactly what happened with the directors of the board... and how it came about when they paid themselves x, y or z. “But we’ve got to have a system in the future whereby we make sure that tour operators are in some way prevented from simply going belly up and then requiring the taxpayer to bring everybody home.” Hundreds of thousands of people who were yet to leave have had their holiday dreams shattered.    They include terminally-ill Matt Dominic and we Lyndsay who were given £, from well-wishers to fly to Tenere today for a kids-free week. It was to be their last holiday. Former Rolls-Royce employee Matt, , who has brain cancer, was given six months to live more than a year ago. The pair, from Derby, expect to get the money back as the holiday is covered by ATOL, but Lyndsay, , fears there will not be enough time to arrange another break. She said: “He was really looking forward to it. He’s not got a lot to look forward to.” A wedding party of  people were stranded at Manchester Airport yesterday after their Thomas Cook flight to Jamaica was cancelled. Distraught couple Lindsay Coupe, , and Lee Bramhall, , were set to jet out ahead of the ceremony on Saturday. Lindsay, of Sheffield, said: “I am gutted. You spend all that time planning and looking forward to your wedding day.” Nine-thousand of Thomas Cook’s workforce are based in the UK.    Some were in tears as they left the firm’s HQ in Peterborough, Cambs, after news broke they had lost their jobs. Peterborough MP and former Thomas Cook employee Lisa Forbes said: “These are good, hard-working people who deserve better.” The firm’s suppliers, including , hoteliers, also risk being out of pocket, with some not paid for months, threatening a wave of job losses. The first Thomas Cook “rescue” flights arrived in the UK last night. Operators including easyJet and Virgin have supplied aircraft to help with the operation co-ordinated by the Civil Aviation Authority.  The CAA admitted it could take two months for those who booked Thomas Cook hols and have yet to travel to get a refund under the ATOL scheme. Customers face the choice of either cancelling their holiday, or paying out for replacement flights and accommodation. The Insolvency Service will probe the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook going bust, with the role of directors part of the inquiry. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom called for a “fast-track” process.    Thomas Cook’s board, led by chief executive Peter Fankhauser, threw in the towel in the early hours of yesterday after a £.billion rescue bid failed. Cabinet ministers face criticism after rejecting the firm’s late plea for a £million bailout. Mr Fankauser insisted they had “worked exhaustively” to salvage a deal. The Swiss businessman said: “I know this outcome will be devastating to many people and will cause a lot of anxiety, stress and disruption.” The £.million he has received since taking charge in  includes a £.million bonus in . Mr Fankhauser and his two previous full-time chief executives got roughly £million between them in the past  years. The collapse has sent shockwaves through the industry. Alan Bowen, of the Association of Atol Companies, warned of a “domino effect”. Brits have hit out at “greedy” travel firms for hiking prices after Thomas Cook went bust.

A total of  Brits had their rooms at the Hotel Cabot Pollensa Park Spa in Menorca aposheld to ransomapos after the travel company went bust this morning. Furious families ed from morning trips to find key cards had been deactivated with all their belongings locked inside. When they questioned the hotel manager he demanded they apospay up or get outapos. Cath and Harvey Hurst flew out from Manchester to Menorca last Friday along with friends Susan and Daryl to celebrate their joint Golden Wedding Anniversary. The Hursts, from Oldham, paid £, for the two-week stay at the hotel.    Cath, , told Mirror: We went out to the beach this morning and when we ed at midday we went to find out what the transfer situation is for ourflight Friday and were told aposyour room is locked and you canapost get intoapos. The manager told us we had to pay £,. I explained that we didnapost have the money and he said apospay it or  you will have to leave the hotelapos. There are seven rooms affected with  people involved including a baby. Weaposve been in a meeting with the rest of the people involved.  Weaposve tried to explain that weaposre with with ABTA and the holiday is ATOL protected and that they would pay but he wasnapost interested.    He said he wanted the money up front because he was saying they wouldnapost pay him. I feel like weaposre being held hostage here. He did eventually say he would reopen the room until noon tomorrow and thenhe hasnapost been paid by us or the others then heaposs going to kick us out. It makes me feel sick. Itaposs absolutely disgusting. We are supposed to be celebrating our wedding anniversary and he has ruined it. Weaposre going to be homeless on holidaywe canapost find another hotel to stay in. Weaposll be either on the streets or in the airport. New mum Grace Buckley,  and her husband Alexander, , are among the  guests affected. They flew out to Menorca for their first holiday abroad with baby Theodore who is eight months old. The couple, from Frome, Somerset, booked the holiday so that Grace was nice and relaxed for herto work after maternity leave. She said: We woke up to the news but were reassured that we would be able to stay in the hotel and not to worry - so we didnapost. We went out for the morning and took in the local sights. When we came back we found our room was locked and our key card didnapost work. We went down to reception and then other people in the same situation started gathering.  The manager came down and we asked why are our rooms had been locked. He said it was because we were Thomas Cook customers and the hotel were getting no money. He told us to pay up or go. There were people that needed medication from their rooms. I needed baby stuff for Theodore. He said it didnapost matter. He didnapost have a care in the world. He was holding our room to ransom. He just didnapost care. Engineering consultant Grace aded: After a two hour negotiation we were allowed back into our room until noon tomorrow. Weaposve given advice from CAA not to pay anything and the manager has been told to let us stay but heaposs ignored that. Itaposs really upsetting. We totally understand itaposs a dficult situation and that staff have lost their jobs but there has been no empathy towards Thomas Cook customers from hotel staff and a complete lack of concern from the manager of the hotel.

Her Audi became airborne after it was shunted in Welling High Street, London.  Becky, from Chatham, Kent, said in the post: Just a quick reminder to anyone who drives like a mad person or forgets to check their mirrors. It can all change so quickly - within a second your le could flash before your eyes like mine did! I hope this brings awareness to you all. Stay safe. The shocking video shows a Hyundai driving down the right lane and then cutting in front of a white van as they approach a set of traffic lights.  As the Hyundai driver cuts in front of the white van, Becky in the black Audi can be seen driving at around mph in the right lane. Just as Becky became level with the Hyundai driver, he then turns right and sticks the front of his car in the path of Becky. The impact sent Beckyaposs Audi into a somersault as it flipped  degrees, landing on it wheels on the other side of the road. The Hyundai driver can then be seen pulling up next to the wrecked Audi as many bystanders flock to Beckyaposs aid.  The video has left many in the comments criticising the Hyundai driver.  Loretta May Tarlington said: Glad you were ok. What a total idiotthat other driver was!Kevin Pritchard added: You could tell he was at the way he pulled in before pulling out again. Looks dramatic! Glad youaposre ok. Darcy J de Sade wrote: Glad youaposre well. I hope the driver got a ban and a record, that was incredibly reckless in a built up area and yes... I spotted him before the crash, he did cut up another driver just beforehand. Keris Swaden said: What a d * head. I hope he loses his licence for this. Driving way too fast, swerving and clearly not paying any attention whatsoever to other road users. No signalling nothing. Shame it werenapost him that flipped. Itaposs always someone  that ends up in the accident. Not the idiot driver. However, one commenter Stephanie Louise said both drivers should take the blame. She commented: The speed of the car that was flipped! Coming down the outside like a maniac. Looks like both drivers at fault. One pulls in then out without checking mirrors and other speeding. Becky today said she wanted to share the video to make people aware of how easy it can happen and how it can affect your whole le. Becky said: I just wanted to get it out there and people have been so kind with their words.

Michelle Eling was watching daughter Brittany, , and one-year-old grandaughter Olivia playing on the kitchen floor of her house in Alvin, Texas. Suddenly the -year-old granaposs rescue dog Harvey approached the baby and attacked her. Before the hound could be stopped it had caused permanent damage to the young girl, nearly ripping off her right ear. The three-foot-tall pooch since been put down after trying to get Oliviaaposs whole head in his mouth. Dog lover Michelle, an accountant, said: “I was standing in the kitchen, Olivia and Brittany were on the floor playing, Brittany was making her giggle.  “I heard Harvey growl. Then I just heard Brittany scream ‘no’, I turned round and saw him lunge at Olivia. “If he hadn’t and he had got hold of her head, I would have had to decide who to save, my pregnant daughter or my granddaughter. All that was going through my mind was, ‘she is not dying in my kitchen’.  There was so much blood, I thought she was going to bleed out. Brittany has three children with chemical plant worker husband, Taylor, , including Mason, three, and Madison, two months. At the time of the attack she was eight months pregnant with her youngest. Regardless, she helped rush Olivia to hospital, where she was kept for two days undergoing one hour of surgery to reattach the tip of her right ear and a two hour skin graft on the top of her head. The attack has left her with permanent scars on her face.  Harvey, who is believed to have been abused by his previous owners, was taken into quarantine for  days by animal control before being put down. Brittany said: “We were supposed to be going home but my Mason wanted to see his grandmother. “It started off normal. I usually tell the dogs to go awaythey approach us but he was been calm. “For some reason I let him come over and out of nowhere he bit her head, he was trying to get her whole head in his mouth.While Brittany remains hopeful that Olivia can’t remember what happened, the youngster is now wary and cautious around other dogs and sometimes wakes up in the night grabbing her ear. “I’ve blocked it out so I only remember bits, the mum continued.I remember my mum and brother trying to pull him away and I put my arm in his mouth. “All I could think was please keep crying because I knewshe was crying then she was alive. “There was blood everywhere. I was pregnant but I wasn’t thinking about me. I just wanted to save my daughter.” Brittany wanted the dog put down, as she realised how close she had come to losing her daughter. But Michelle said she felt sorry for the pooch and blamed his previous owners for the way they had treated him. Michelle added: “It was a complete shock because was a sweet dog, you could just tell he’d been abused. “He didn’t know how to be a dog, he didn’t know how to run and didn’t like going on the grass. “He didn’t have a good le, but he was sweet and he wanted attention. “Shame on the people who owned him before, I just hope in the two months he spent with us it showed him a dferent le. The grandma was conflicted when it came to whether the dog should be out down. “You don’t want to see an animal put down but once they have done something like this there’s no going back, she said. “It’s catch .

The -square mile island of Ikaria claims to have more nonaganerians than any other place on the planet. Research suggests one in three inhabitants of the picturesque island reach the age of .  So itaposs no surprise that researchers have been trying to decode the secret to the elderly islandersapos longevity - finding clues in their Mediterranean diets, midday naps and sex well into their vintage years.    Anthropologists have long pointed to fresh, healthy Mediterranean diets rich in fish and olive oil as an elixir of long-le. The so-called blue zone describes the regions dotted around the world where populations are thought to live the longest. Along with Ikaria, in the Aegean Sea, anthropologists have identied the worldaposs blue zones to include: the Japanese island of Okinawa, claimed to be home to the worldaposs longest-lived women, Costa Ricaaposs Nicoya Pensinsula where there were lower than normal rates of middle-aged mortality, and Italian tourism beautyspot Sardinia. Backed by National Geographic, bestselling author and longevity Dan Buettner and his research team of demographics experts have in recent years explored blue zones including Ikaria in hopes of unlocking their secrets to long le.   He wrote in the New York Times in  of his visit to the island - noting how previous claims of long-living populations were often debunked - but Ikariaaposs reputation held steadfast.Researchers found record-keeping in some villages storied for localaposs longevity meant many people didnapost actually know their own ages. Whataposs more, some beauty-spots discovered that reputations for longevity drew tourism. But researchers in Greece found solid documentation to back Ikariaaposs claims of a long-living population. They discovered locals reached the age of  at two-and-a-half times the rate Americans do.    Successive studies have found the islandaposs villagers were in comparatively better health, and living longer before they were beset with cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia and depression. A University of Athens School of Medicine study analysed the diet of hundreds of Ikarians, finding they consumed plenty of beans and fish - and ate meat only about five times a month. The Ikaria Study also found the elderly islanders had a diet low in refined sugar but high in olive oil. They noted the islanders consumed two to three cups of coffee and two to four glasses of wine a day. Mr Buettneraposs own research teamaposs interviews found islanders enjoying diets low in heart disease-inducing saturated fats found in meat and dairy, and high in antioxidant-rich and pesticide-free greens grown in their own gardens.

Luna Fenner was born with Congenital Melanotic Nevus - an abnormally dark skin patch composed of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It affects just . per cent of the worldaposs population and puts sufferers at an increased risk of developing a cancerous melanoma. In Lunaaposs case, she was born with a large dark aposnevusapos on her face which is reminiscent of a Batman mask. Her mum Carol, , of south Florida, has been searching for a treatment and only found doctors in the US willing to perform laser surgery.  But following media attention earlier this year a Russian surgeon came forward and offered to perform pioneering treatment which is not available in America. Carol said: “They have technology there that isn’t available in the US yet, in the US it would take four years for Luna to be treated, but in Russia I’m told it will be  months. “The doctors in the US kept giving me dferent advice, I felt so lost, and didn’t know what to do. “Everybody thinks I’m crazy to go to Russia but I have done a lot of research and gained advice from several doctors and I really think that this is the best option for Luna right now.”    It took doctors six days to diagnose Lunaaposs condition after her birth in March . Carol said: “I was in complete shock. When Luna was first born nobody in the room knew what the condition was. “My last ultrasound before the birth had revealed nothing abnormal. MRI scans did not detect cancer but Carol was warned that the condition could evolve into the disease in future. She began desperately searching for surgeons who could perform operations to help her daughter’s condition.    Full-time mum Carol said: “A surgeon in Boston all told me that Luna must be subjected to over  sessions of laser treatments. “I didn’t feel comfortable with that, I wanted her to start school at the right time and feel like she could fit in with the other kids. “Other surgeons in New York, Chicago and Florida told me that laser would be the worst thing for Luna. They all had very dferent opinions about what to do and when.” Just as Carol was losing hope a new message arrived from across the world.She received a message from the office of surgeon-oncologist Pavel Borisovich Popov, MD, PhD of  laserterapy.ru .Carol said: “He had seen Luna’s case in a Russian newspaper and he said he had some options for Luna that weren’t available in the USA yet.    After discussions with Dr. Popov, Carol and her husband, Thiago Taes, , who works in construction, decided that they would give it a try. Carol said: “They will check her and do some exams.” “Dr. Popov agreed for me to meet some parents of patients who have done it before.” “My husband will stay here to pay for bills and everything.” If her initial tests go to plan then Luna will receive six to eight surgeries over the course of  months, with each procedure costing around , USD - a total of ,. A GoFundMe page set up by the family has so far raised , out of a target of , to pay for her ongoing treatment. Carol said: “It’s been very dficult for us to raise the money. We still have a long way to go.” Tomorrowsix-month-old Luna will head to Krasnodar in southern Russia with her mother for tests.    Amid all the uncertainty regarding Luna’s condition Carol says she hasn’t taken time to process what is about to happen. She said: “I haven’t stopped to think about it yet. I think I am probably going to freak out when we get to the airplane.” “It will be a huge reliefit works for Luna.” Carol says that besides her unusual skin condition Luna is just like any other six-month-old child. “She just learned how to jump and she giggles all the time, she’s very calm, she doesn’t cry often. “I want to finish the surgeries before she heads to school. “I don’t want her to get bullied.

Rhian Binns, , had queued up at the chain in Wakefieldaposs Westgate rail station to buy a cup of tea. She ordered it with lactose-free milk but as as she tried to get her words out out she became stuck on the sound lac. She said it prompted the female member of staff who was serving her to start laughing, with the laughter continuing when Rhian struggled to get her words out a second time. Rhian paid for the tea and quickly left before later tweeting her disgust at the way she was allegedly treated in front of other customers. I only queued up so I could get a tea before catching the train, she said.    When I tried to ask for lactose-free milk I got stuck on the aposlacapos, so it came out as aposlac, lac, lacapos over and over. The woman who was serving me just started laughing. I paused and tried speaking again but the same thing happened and the woman just laughed at me again. I was conscious of the other customers in the queue and I felt so embarrassed and humiliated by what happened I left as quickly as I could. Having a stammer draws attention to you already but when someone laughs at you that makes it even worse. One campaign group described the member of staffaposs reaction as appalling.    Rhian, a communications officer from Wakefield, says sheaposs lived with her stammer since she was two years old and has often been ridiculed as a result. My stammer is completely random, she said. So I never know when itaposs going to come on, or which words will trigger it. It can be hard enough to get the words out but when I visit shops and other places thereaposs the pressure of having to speak more quickly. Iaposve been laughed at before and I donapost usually complain. But after this Iaposve decided enough is enough and I need to speak out. Rhian was travelling to a business event at Birminghamaposs NEC on Thursday morning when the incident happened. She says it dented her confidence and made her reluctant to network at the event as she usually would.  And sheaposs now calling on Costa to ensure staff are trained properly so they treat speech impediments as they would any other disability. Unfortunately, thereaposs still a stigma around stammering and there needs to be more training for staff, she said. The woman who served me may laughed because she didnapost know how to react but that stigma will remain unless people are educated. Jane Powell, CEO of the British Stammering Association trading as Stamma, said: A stammer is a physical struggle to speak. The idea that people can laugh at this is appalling. We hear time and again from people who stammer that while living with a stammer is tough, the reactions of others that can cause profound and long lasting hurt.

With only Mark Reynolds a stick-on starter, there are big decisions to be made over the fitness of new boy Troy Brown or whether to opt for Paul Watson or midfielder Calum Butcher against the Red Lichties.Going for the latter in central defence would likely see Ian Harkes come into the midfield.And the American’s inclusion would be a welcome one, in my opinion.His impact in the derby win over Dundee was clear, not only with his goal but overall play.Up top, Louis Appere has impressed but when Nicky Clark came on at Ayr he looked lively and is a proven scorer at this level.Much to ponder as United look to remove the spoke from their wheel and get back on the title charge."},{"url":null,"title":"joy for dundee united fan after lawrence shankland accepts marriage proposal","story":"A Twitter user has shared a picture of him #proposing# to Dundee United striker Lawrence Shankland.mdash andy crichtonSeptember , Hundreds of people have liked the tweet by user Andy Crichton, who pictured himself with the player holding a candy wedding ring, with the caption: #He only went and said yes##Shankland scored twice in four minutes to seal an unlikely win for United against Arbroath on Saturday, his second goal coming deep into injury time .A number of well-wishers congratulated the United fan for his #proposal#.Shankland has scored an impressive  goals in  games for United this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d8892db442333.34918417.jpg ","title":"playtime for youngsters as trail opens at dundee primary school","story":"Young children’s imaginations have been running wild as they enjoy active play on a new wooden trim trail area at their school.Pupils at Downfield Primary School gave the seal of approval to their new outdoor play area at its official opening.The event brought together many people who helped make the new play area possible, including members of Downfield PS Parent Partnership, who raised £, towards the total cost of the project.The other £, was paid for using a grant from Strathmartine Regeneration Forum’s community fund, at Dundee City Council.The equipment has been a roaring success with the kids since it was installed.Karen Emmett, the school’s head teacher, said: “As soon as the fencing came down and the contractors were out, the children were all over it. It’s been so well used and made such a dference to their playtime.”The area is part of a larger project within the school to promote and encourage outdoor play and education.Karen continued: “The wooden trim trail area allows children to actively play together, socialise and engage in more purposeful play.“They can climb, jump, balance and duck around the horseshoe- shaped structure using lots of dferent active skills.”Pupils helped come up with ideas for the playground and these were made a reality by the school’s parent council.John Anderson-McGuinness, chairman of Downfield PS Parent Partnership, said: “The kids came up with things they wanted to do, rather than asking for traditional equipment.“They said they wanted to climb, use ropes and have a rolling pole that they had seen somewhere , which we managed to incorporate.“The kids think it’s great. They have to be let on in groups because there’s so many of them wanting to go on it at playtime.”John said the partnership has already started gathering ideas from pupils of what they would like to add to the area to extend it in phase two of the project – yet to secure funding.Ideas for this next phase include a seating area and a decked area which could also be used as an outdoor classroom in summer."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street dundee seek back to back wins as united aim to bounce back","story":"This week Tele sports reporters Calum Woodger, George Cran and Graeme Finnan askDundee can make it two wins in a row as they travel to Morton and will United come back from defeat at Ayr  Elsewhere, former Tangerines boss Craig Levein is feeling the heat.Call the #Twa Teams, One Street# fan line on   to leave a message for the boys about all things Dundee and United.For iTunes: click hereFor Spoty: click hereOr search #Tele Twa Teams, One Street# in the podcast app of your choice."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.34205102-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.34205102-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.34205102-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.34205102-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win tickets to oktoberfest in dundee or tickets to a movie with our two fantastic competitions","story":"Four lucky readers could win tickets for Oktoberfest being held in Dundee this weekend!Organised by Dundee Rotary, Oktoberfest is bringing a taste of Germany back to the Slessor Gardens.You can enjoy great beer, tasty food and fantastic live entertainment during the three day festival.The event will feature live music from bands including Heaven .We have one pair of tickets for Friday September , and one pair for Saturday September .To be in with a chance of winning just answer the following question and tell us whether you would prefer to go on the Friday or Saturday:Q: What is a “stein”  a a large beer mug b a German footballer c a unit of currency.Or,you#re more of a film buff than a beer swigger, you can be in with a chance of winning a pair of cinema tickets for Cineworld in Dundee.To enter the prize draw simply answer the following question:Q: John Wayne starred in which famous film  a True Grit b Truly, Madly, Deeply c Vlad the Impaler: The True Story of DraculaPlease include your name, address and contact details.Good luck!Terms and Conditions: Competition closes at pm on Wednesday September   at and winner will be chosen at random from combined correct entries.Prizes are as stated.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world.

They reported their exercise every two years.Increasing consumption of any type of nut was linked to less long-term weight gain and a lower risk of becoming obese.Increasing nut consumption by half a serving a day was associated with a lower risk of putting on two or more kilos over any four-year period.Substituting snacks such as chocolates, pastries, pies and donuts with half a serving of nuts was associated with staving off weight gain of between . and .kg in any four-year period.A daily half serving increase of walnuts was linked to a % lower risk of obesity.The findings remained after taking account of changes in diet and lestyle, such as exercise and alcohol intake.The researchers say that, as the study is observational, it cannot establish cause.They suggest that chewing nuts takes more effort than eating fast food, while the high fibre content can make people feel full for longer.Nut fibre binds well to fat in the gut, meaning more calories are excreted.The study is published in the online journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention  Health..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: The key to keeping trim could be nuts"},{"url":null,"title":"cockenzie-man-wrongly-claimed-thousands-pounds-benefits","story":"William Stewart, of Winton Park, knowingly made  declarations to officials at the Department for Work and Pensionsby stating he did not have capital that was in excess of the allowed amount.But following a DWP investigation, it was found that Stewart did have more savings than he had declared.Stewart claimed pound,. in employment and support allowance between October , , and November , .He also claimed pound,. in Universal Credit between September , , and August  last year.And the -year-old was also paid pound,. in Universal Credit he was not entitled to between November , , and July , .Stewart admitted his guilt at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he ed to court last Wednesday for sentencing.Sherf Peter McCormack heard that the money had been paid back to the DWP and decided to fine the offender pound."},{"url":null,"title":"celebrations-mark-25-years-port-seton-centre","story":"The centrersquos management committee and staff held the weekend of celebrations on August -.They began in the main hall on the Friday evening with the community awards .

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real. We just need to start noticing it, and valuing it.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet. It would be stupid of me to say lsquothis could happenrsquo or lsquothat could happenrsquo when it might not.According to East Lothian Council the plans are still at ldquothe initial stage. However, the local authority has stressed it is aiming to ldquoenhance parking provision in such a way that the number of available spaces in Haddington is increased beyond current levels and that better use is made of each space.Currently, Haddington town centre is home to more than  spaces.The long-stay car park at Tesco has  spaces, which includes two disabled and car club spaces and four public electric charge spaces.On the opposite side of Court Street, the car park at East Lothian Councilrsquos headquarters, John Muir House, has  spaces.The majority of those ndash  ndash are long stay but the car park is reserved for ldquocouncil-based activities between am and pm throughout the week and is only available to the general public at the weekend and outwith those times.Proposals suggest a revamp of High Street, which has  spaces Market Street, which has  spaces Hardgate, which has four spaces and Court Street, which can accommodate  cars.Meanwhile,  town centre residents have parking permits, which enable them to park in any of the restricted -minute maximum parking areas for any duration.East Lothian Council has not revealed the number of spaces ndash or the site ndash for any proposed car park at Whittingehame Drive, although it has been suggested as having between  and  spaces.Liz McDougall, chairwoman of the Nungate Gala committee, told the Courier that the council had not been in touch about the proposals.She was concerned about the impact it could have on their gala activities. Andshe questionedthe local authority were ldquotrying to slide it in the back door and said: ldquoWe have never heard anything from the council.ldquoI was told about it from another colleague and then I spoke to Moira Graham, of Graham the Jeweller, and she was telling me about it and saying this was going to happen.Irsquom not exactly thrilled about the idea to be honest simply because this is going to cause a lot of issues for the gala.The new car park would need a planning application to progress.Ward councillor Craig Hoy, who lives in the town, said: ldquoI welcome plans for signicant long-stay parking facilities at Whittingehame Drive and have been pressing for action in this area.ldquoThis could be the missing piece of the jigsaw which allows us to press ahead with investment to enhance the town centre, overcoming very valid concerns about a net loss of parking.

Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"dear-children-thank-39-re-sorry-voices-climate-strike","story":"Esther Silverton, , EdinburghThe biggest dference from when I did my first strike at the beginning of February to now is how people view the issue. When we started the strikes,I look back at my first speech, it was all about how we need to wake up the world. No one was talking about climate change. Now what wersquore saying is that the world knows and now we need to act.To me the first step to changing everything is awareness. Itrsquos a really huge thing and powerful. I do feel itrsquos working. Everybody knows that climate change is a thing now, and itrsquos an actual issue that will affect us. Before, it was like, ldquoYeah, I need to turn off the lights to save the polar bears. Now people we leaflet to in the street will say, ldquoYes, I get why you are doing this, eventhey donrsquot agree with it. Thatrsquos probably the biggest indication that itrsquos working.I think itrsquos kids that are doing this because we havenrsquot been swayed by normal society as much. As soon as you get a job and go into normal le you do what you do to get by, whereas wersquore still in a place where we can try things like striking and do as much as we can. We can imagine something dferent and a world that isnrsquot shaped as much.Finlay Pringle, , UllapoolThis is my fortieth climate strike. When I was younger I always had a fascination with the ocean and that was reaffirmed when I went snorkelling with my parents. I realised it was beautul, and this beautul place needed protecting.I felt pretty angry that we as human beings were destroying that incredible place ndash whether it be through plastic pollution or climate change. So I decided, with my sister, that we were going to start climate striking on December . We believe we were the first in the UK. Back then there was no Extinction Rebellion in our area, no Scottish Youth Climate Strikes. So we got in contact with Fridays for Future, the organisation that Greta set up. It grew from there.It angers me that we as human beings have let it get this bad. We were being told back when it was black and white TV that there was such a thing as climate change. What did we do  We just pretended it didnrsquot exist. Itrsquos human nature to leave everything to the very last minute. If we do that with climate change there will be no stopping it.I would like our governments to actually do something. Politicians can say climate emergency, but what does it actually mean  We need radical action. We need net zero by . Wersquove got till  to turn this ship around. If we donrsquot reach that deadline then the world is basically doomed. And I hate to put it like that because Irsquom usually quite optimistic.I find it shocking that people my age donrsquot think that climate change is real. It is the greatest threat that we as humanity have ever faced. I read books, IPCC reports, online articles. Because we know the stuff, we become the teachers and we teach everyone . I feel like we as climate strikers have almost a role to educate. We shouldnrsquot be having to do this. It should be the government. But currently it is us ndash and we can educate people about the climate crisis and about some of the small things they can do.Martine Miller, parent, EdinburghIrsquove become more and more educated recently about climate change and what our future is going to look like. Irsquove got a daughter who is three years old and Irsquom terried about what world shersquos going to inherit ndash and not even in that far off distance. Becoming a parent just really brought it home to me. The young people have really galvanised support for the issue and raised awareness. This is my first climate protest. Irsquove not been on any sort of protest before. Everything wersquove done so far has just been at an inidual level, making small changes at home.Charlotte Muller-Stuart, , PeeblesItrsquos insane how much the strike has progressed. When we first started it was literally just  of us including a few friends from Peebles that I managed to drag up to Edinburgh. Now its tens of thousands. I do think people are starting to listen. I think therersquos not enough panic though. Irsquove found that quite a lot of the time with the politicians, they will secretly tell us, ldquoI shouldnrsquot be saying this but I think itrsquos really good that yoursquore striking. They just think itrsquos good that wersquore getting involved in activism and that wersquore having a political say.Quite a lot of the debate about the strikes is more about the action of us striking rather than what wersquore actually trying to say and the reasons why wersquore striking.There is also still so much that our government can do in Scotland that they arenrsquot doing right now. Things like more peatland restoration.People take it far more seriously when kids go out on strike rather than adults protesting because when adults do it, it comes off as hippyish. Itrsquos not taken as seriously as children sacricing their education and making this statement that says, lsquoWhy should we go to schoolwersquore not going to have a future rsquoI think itrsquos really important not just to educate the youth, but also to educate the adults. People know about climate change but they donrsquot know the scale of the problem. I think so many adults are in denial about it. I think they donrsquot want to acknowledge it. Also there are quite a lot of adults that donrsquot know about it as well. In March I asked five teachersany of them had heard of the IPCC report and all of them said that they hadnrsquot.Mike Shepherd, retired petroleum geologist and author of Oil Strike North SeaOur city streets echo with youngsters campaigning for action on climate change youngsters who care passionately about the future of our planet. The environmental groups that support them insist that Big Oil must be shut down to prevent further global warming. It all seems very worthy, and herersquos my opinion: they are distracting us from the real problem.Donrsquot get me wrong here ndash climate change is all too real and will cause dficulties in the decades to come. My grouse with the protests is that they drown out the discussion that should be taking place instead.The world population of humans are increasingly city dwellers. In the UK almost  per cent of us inhabit the urban landscape. Our food is produced by farmers with their diesel-fuelled tractors the food they harvest is then transported to our shops by diesel-fuelled lorries. Electric tractors and lorries do exist but are not common yet.The climate protestors should note that oil as a fuel must not be phased out until alternative methods of fuelling tractors and lorries are in place and can be shown to cope with the challenge of feeding our huge urban population. Get this one wrong and billions will starve - itrsquos that serious.Step back to  when the world population was . billion. The global economy had been recovering from the recent war, and received a boost when huge oil fields were brought on stream in the Middle East and North Africa. Cheap energy fuelled a humongous increase in human activity lsquothe great accelerationrsquo academics call it.From  to now, humans, particularly in the affluent west, have seen a substantial change to their standard of living.During this time the world avoided major famines, not the least because of the lsquoGreen Revolutionrsquo in the s when wheat and rice yields increased substantially. In consequence, the world population has increased to over . billion today. Thatrsquos an extra five billion people since . Cheap oil is responsible for underpinning this huge population increase. If oil runs out and nothing takes its place, the props fall away . Plan A is thus to replace oil with alternative energy sources as a priority. We have to.Dylan Hamilton, , LinlithgowOne analogy I use to explain why young people are pushing this is the boiled frog. If you put a frog in a pot of water and slowly heat up the temperature the frog will boil and die. Butyou put a frog into already boiling water, it will immediately jump out. So the boiled frog represents the grown up, but the young people are the frog that jumps out. The dference is wersquore tied to the boiled frog andwe all donrsquot act then we all die.Irsquove been striking weekly since February . I met Greta in August in Switzerland. What struck me was that she is a really down to earth person. I was on crutches at the time and she was the only person in the entire room that helped me carry my food.The things Irsquove learned over the past eight months are actually less to do with climate change and more to do with society ndash the little political tricks, how to talk to politicians. I think wersquore having an impact on how politicians think. Every time they make a policy, wersquore in the back of their minds. Nicola Sturgeon declared a climate emergency and the Greens have said wersquove given them momentum to push harder because they can say wersquove got tens of thousands of young people pushing for this as well. Scotland likes to claim that theyrsquore a world leader andthis is threatening their status as a world leader, theyrsquoll try to keep up the the good profile. Not quite enough is being done but itrsquos better than it was.Obviously what I want from these strikes is for us to stop the emissions of greenhouse gases. But more specically what I think they could do is implement a Green New Deal. So we would become a renewable and completely sustainable society ndash because at the moment our system isnrsquot built to be sustainable and renewable. We use the term Just Transition a lot. We would have to have a Just Transition to get jobs in renewables so people wouldnrsquot be out of work. Everything would have to be renewable and not killing the earth.Hilary Brown, marketing manager, EdinburghAlthough I am a politically aware person and have marched many times over the years, it is fair to say that my daughterrsquos concern about climate crisis and her much repeated plea, \"Wersquove just  years to stop climate change before itrsquos too late\" led me to commit to joining the global strike. I should have been working, but made a very last minute decision to walk away from it and support the strike. She and her friends have attended some the Friday climate strikes and I am proud of their commitment to raising the urgency of the climate emergency as a political priority. I also find it demands a personal response from me. Younger people are understandably able to focus on the immediate threat posed by climate emergency and donrsquot hedge their bets in terms of what needs to be done about it. There are so many lsquoah butsrsquo and lsquowhat srsquo that plague any debate for politicians and that stop people from committing to radical change. I have very valid distractions plus a degree of complacency and,Irsquom honest, cynicism about the ability to make change happen. I find that the young climate strikers are bringing clarity to the issue and making me acknowledge the need for urgent and sustained action. I am blown away by Greta Thunberg ndash how well informed she is and the way she articulates the reality of the situation facing the world ndash not in her first language either! I donrsquot really like the generational blame game. Many people my age and older have marched and campaigned all their lives and won many rights. They have made the world a better place for all of us lucky enough to claim those rights. But I do understand the anger young people feel about the future they face. Itrsquos not so much that they are more aware of the issue than their elders. We are all well aware. The dference is their sense of urgency about doing the things needed to tackle it. I find there is less and less excuse for me, as a person with dependents and a whole iety of responsibilities, not to make this as much of a priority as they do."},{"url":null,"title":"39-re-gloomed-cope-times-eco-anxiety","story":"ldquoI was thinking way more about humans rather than nature.

One, -year-old Dylan Hamilton, says there are times when he has felt ldquoreally down. ldquoIrsquove never felt like giving up. But I struggle a lot because I also have chronic fatigue, so it makes everything ten times more dficult. I have to constantly keep up and be on top of my learning. That can be really stressful and Irsquove had a few burn outs, but I never stop striking.Dylan first started to question how we were behaving around the environment when he was eight. ldquoI was in the eco committee at school, he recalls, ldquobut I got really fed up because it felt like all we were doing was taking out the bins.

Over the past year, it has become a question for me.

What would you suggest we do Sophiarsquos reply, she says, is something she often quotes. She said: ldquoThe thing is, it is dficult, but you must tell me the truth. Andyou donrsquot tell me the truth yoursquore lying to me ndash and Irsquom not a baby.ldquoI loved the way she put that, says Hickman. ldquoShersquos spot on. We mustnrsquot treat them like theyrsquore babies. They do need to be prepared for the realities of these things. But a parent needs to be able to process their own feelings a little bit to talk to the child. They need to have taken a little bit of time and thought, well how do I feel  How upset am I  Whatrsquos getting in the way of me talking to my child  Irsquove talked to a few children about this and they saidyou donrsquot talk to us, we feel abandoned.In , The Mental Health Foundation published a poll of parents exploring how, in an era of -hour news and social media, they felt their children were responding to larger world events andthey were able to adequately discuss the issues with their children. Around a third of parents said their children were anxious around global warming and climate change.Off the back of their poll, they published some advice, which, they suggest, might be relevant to parents concerned about how they handle their childrenrsquos exposure to climate crisis news. ldquoThe advice that wersquove developed, says Julie Cameron, head of programmes at The Mental Health Foundation Scotland, ldquois that trying to have a news black-out and shield your children isnrsquot helpful. Likewise, of course, neither is extreme over-exposure.Cameron suggests taking time to watch the news with your child, particularly an age-appropriate show like Newsround, and making sure that there is plenty of opportunity for conversation following it. ldquoItrsquos taking the time to explore this with them. Itrsquos okay to acknowledge that this is quite scary and tricky stuff and that none of us have complete control over it. You also need to reassure them that itrsquos okay and in their day-to-day le they are safe. Amongst their advice too is that itrsquos good for adult mental health to get ldquocivically involved. ldquoThis is probably applicable to children too. We say become civically active, become engaged.That activism can be good for mental health is something that Hickman echoes. Itrsquos also a frequent reflection from those young people who are deeply involved in the climate strike. ldquoStriking helps me deal with it, says Muller-Stuart. ldquoItrsquos definitely empowering. Because otherwise you can feel so helpless ndash like yoursquore the only one. You go to a global strike where there are thousands of other people and itrsquos more empowering and it makes you think itrsquos not just you. Therersquos a lot more hope. Another emotion that climate strikers frequently express is anger ndash often at the older generations. As John Thorne, secretary for Climate Psychology Alliance Scotland notes, ldquoIf yoursquore , yoursquove done very little to cause this issue, and yoursquove got a total right to be angry about it and thatrsquos a good thing. Because being angry and upset means we do something.But it would be wrong to paint a picture of a modern world ided into adults who are in denial and young people who are the truth speakers and sufferers of eco anxiety. Itrsquos not quite like that. Many adults in the environmental and other radical movements, or working in renewables, or researching related science, have been trying to address this issue for a very long time. Adults get despair too ndash and grief, and another more hampering emotion, guilt.Another problem, Hickman says, parents find, in dealing with their childrenrsquos climate-related distress, is that there is nothing in their personal histories to relate the current crisis to. ldquoIf your child comes home upset because of bullying, as a parent you can call on your own experience of dealing with those problems. But we havenrsquot got our own history of dealing with this.Of course, all of us will recall some global or national threat from our own childhood: the nuclear threat, HIV Aids. Hickman believes this is not quite the same. ldquoWhat makes this subtly dferent is the fact that wersquore all culpable for this, even through the small decisions we make. There is also a great deal of uncertainty attached to it. It may be man-made, but itrsquos not in our control ndash we donrsquot know when the tipping points will be. That makes us utterly vulnerable and hugely aware of our dependency on our environment.These are things I hear echoed by many young people. They are acutely aware of their own impacts, yet at the same time of their smallness in relation to the problem. ldquoItrsquos so big, says Charlotte Muller-Stuart, ldquoand therersquos so much. Itrsquos also hard to switch off from. You canrsquot really brush it off. Everything that you do, every single day, is somehow affecting the environment in some way.We are lucky, in this country, to be, as yet, relatively little impacted by climate change. This makes it easier to comfort our children, tell them they are currently safe. Thatrsquos not the case for all children. Hickman has also interviewed children in the Males, who are on the frontline of sea-level rises. ldquoThe children there, she observes, ldquoare saying itrsquos happening now. They said to me, lsquoPeople in Iceland had a funeral for a glacier, we watched it online ndash wherersquos our funeral  Who is going to care about us rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"Labour s self-destructing Brexit policy     negotiate and reject     is incoherence on stilts","story":"Labour are of course correct that the Liberal Democrats have made a nonsense of their own party name by refusing to recognise the democratic vote for Brexit in . Of course, I sympathise. I would revoke Article  tomorrow,I had the choice. But you simply cant tell people that their vote in a referendum is to be ignored, cast aside, because they werent clever enough to understand what they were voting for.UK voters were promised in  that their decision would be honoured, not least in the millions of government leaflets put through their doors. The LibDems claim to be the great champions of civil liberties and human rights, yet they are prepared to abandon the most important right of all: the right to vote.We now know what would have happened in Scotland had voted for independence. The Liberal Democrats, who were in government at the time with the Tories, would simply have just rejected it. Impossible to implement. Scots didnt know what they were voting for. Chaos wasnt on the ballot paper.So the LibDems have made an egregious error, but this doesnt mean that Labours policy is much better. It is marginally more democratic, at least in offering voters a choice. But what a choice.Jeremy Corbyn says that he will negotiate a new and better Brexit than the Tories. Britain would remain in the EU Customs Union with the closest possible alignment with the European Single Market. Britain would retain all the work place and environmental protections that Theresa May offered to add to her Withdrawal Agreement that Labour rejected.Under Labours plan the UK would therefore remain under the rules of the single market, overseen by the European Court of Justice, and would have all trade policy set by Brussels. Now, Im not knocking this. It is essentially the Norway option of remaining in the European Economic Area that was rejected by parliament in March. However, just how would this look to a Brexit voter Labour is proposing to put Remain and their Norway Plus as the only choices in their Final Say referendum. But is that really a choice  It sounds like Remain v Leave-in-name-only. Thinking back to the Scottish vote, it would be like holding an independence referendum in which the choices were: Remain in the UK versus Federalism. That would have been condemned, rightly, because independence supporters were denied any say.I am a supporter of remaining in the European Union. I have long argued that the Norway option is the obvious compromise. But it seems to me inconceivable that a referendum on leaving the European Union could exclude the option of, er, leaving the European Union. What are they thinking The trouble with both Labour and the Liberal Democrats is that theyrsquore talking to themselves. Brainwashed by their social media feeds, they think that Brexiteers are a species of bigots who dont deserve to have the vote at all. Some academics have actually said that there should be an educational qualication before people are allowed to vote.But this isnt the worst of Labours Brexit policy. Mr Corbyn first has to negotiate his ldquocredible Leave option\", a bespoke deal that allows the UK to have all the benefits of membership of the European Single Market without actually being a formal member of it. But Labours Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, and the Shadow Foreign Secretary, Emily Thornberry, say theyll campaign for Remain in the Final Say, against their own partyrsquos policy.What is Brussels going to say  Well, Mr Corbyn, we really dont see why we should be bending over backwards, sideways and upside down in order to offer a deal that your lot are going to reject in a referendum. Thank you for coming.If Labour get a deal that meets all their criteria on jobs, environment, trade, free movement etc, so why on earth would they vote against their own negotiating triumph, their own policy  ldquoWe the Labour Party have reached an agreement with the European Union that gives us everything we asked for, so we are going to reject this disgraceful sell-out.Not so much a Final Say as Famous Last Words. No wonder Fiona Bruce was confused on Question Time. This incoherence explains why Labour has been overtaken by the Liberal Democrats in the latest YouGov opinion poll.The opposition have lost the plot on Brexit. Its not a good look when political parties make fools of themselves. Im almost tempted to say: come back Theresa May, all is forgiven. Perhaps the Labour MP, Stephen Kinnock, is right: Labour should have voted for Mays compromise, or at the very least abstained, when they had the chance.Her Withdrawal Agreement is the best that Brussels was prepared to offer, and she conceded quite a lot to Labour on employment rights and the environment. The UK was going to be allowed to remain, effectively, in the single market and customs union until a new trade deal was negotiated. The idea that the EU would offer more to Jeremy Corbyn, only for his party to reject it, is for the birds.Boris Johnson is clearly going to bring back a version of Mays Withdrawal Agreement, sans the Irish Backstop, even though it was rejected three times in parliament. And yes, I know it wasnt rejected solely over the backstop, but times change. Anyway, there will still be a backstop, only it will have moved to the Irish Sea in Boriss cunning plan. But parliament is going to have to take a good look at itself when this is put before MPs on October .The Benn Act, that compels the government to avoid no-deal, will surely be null and voidparliament rejects the only deal on offer. The only certainty then will be Article , which triggers Britains departure from the European Union whether or not there is a deal. MPs voted by a majority of  to trigger Article  in . They have voted down every alternative since then.I dont actually believe that Boris Johnson wants a crash-out Brexit: he is proud that he has managed to get movement from Brussels. But make no mistake. If parliament continues to preicate, and fails to come up with a majority for any kind of compromise, then Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October . It is irresponsible to demand a further extension of Ait is to no purpose.It sickens me to say it, but there is a half-decent Brexit deal on offer and MPs will have to think very carefully before rejecting it. The alternative will not be revoking A, or a referendum, both of which have been rejected by MPs. The alternative will be a hard-right Brexit. And parliament will be as much to blame as Boris Johnson."},{"url":null,"title":"wild-swimming-becomes-scotlands-latest-tourism-craze","story":"In winter ndash even with the troubled funicular abandoned and out of service ndash skiers and snowboarders whizz by the lochrsquos sandy beach on their way to the Day Lodge car park, padded in expensive layers of Gore-Tex and soft down to deflect the bitter cold and biting wind.On the Loch Morlich beach, however, Alice Goodridge can be found in her swimwear, clutching a sledgehammer to bash through a layer of ice, ready to dip her toe into shockingly cold water.Wanting to shed warm layers to tiptoe over a snow-covered beach to reach the ice-covered loch for a dip may sound a niche activity to be savoured by a masochistic few.However, wild swimming in the shadow of Scotlandrsquos once premier ski facility ndash and at a multitude of picturesque spots around Scotland throughout the year ndash has become one of the nationrsquos fastest-growing sports.Previously a way of le for generations who did not have the luxury of heated indoor pools or foreign holidays, outdoor swimming has soared in popularity in recent years, fuelled by adventurous outdoors explorers keen to embrace new challenges and increasing evidence of the therapeutic values of the great outdoors.Itrsquos now among a range of lsquowellnessrsquo activities which national tourism body VisitScotland is encouraging businesses to embrace in order to tap into a growing global market for mood-enhancing natural experiences.Recent research into tourism trends carried out by VisitScotland showed lsquorestorative recreationrsquo ndash the involvement in activities like wild swimming or lsquoforest bathingrsquo, which soothe the soul or inspire feelings of lsquowellnessrsquo ndash is gathering momentum.The body has called on tourism businesses to consider how to attract a slice of a poundbn wellness sector, pointing to research which found lsquowellness travellersrsquo tend to be high-spending, high-yield visitors, with international wellness tourists spending an average of % more than others.To help highlight the potential, the lure of the bitterly cold dip from the Cairngorm Wild Swimmersrsquo perspective will be explored in a new VisitScotland podcast, Ceud Migravele Fagraveilte, due to be broadcast later this month.Helen Campbell, head of visitor marketing at VisitScotland, said: ldquoWith many of our waterways and lochs set against stunning backdrops of magical forests and dramatic mountains it is little wonder we have seen a trend for wild swimming over the years, most recently as part of the growing global wellness movement.ldquoWellness tourism has grown more than twice as fast as tourism overall worldwide, with more and more visitors looking for immersive experiences or ways to improve self-development.ldquoOur coasts and waters embrace opportunities for wellness, increasing the desire of the traveller to escape, recharge and experience new things, and there is potential for wild swimming to grow even further in  as Scotland celebrates the Year of Coasts and Waters.Cairngorm Wild Swimmers launched in  with just ten people but now has over  members in its Facebook group.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We should not underestimate our achievements to date in tackling climate change – we have already almost halved emissions since . “We cannot, however, be complacent.

They are then being asked to report where and when they saw them on the Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels websitescottishsquirrels.org.uk.Saving Scotland’s Red Squirrels is a partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust that is working to protect red squirrels where they are most under threat from the spread of non-native grey squirrels. Squirrel sightings received from the public help the project understand how red and grey squirrel populations are changing over time and decide where to focus conservation efforts.Prject manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: “We monitor squirrel populations throughout the year, and in  we received an incredible  squirrel sightings from members of the public.“This year, thanks to support from National Lottery players, we’re trying something a bit dferent.“By going out and looking for squirrels during the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey people can help us create a more detailed snapshot of the current situation on the ground.”Autumn is an ideal time of year for squirrel-watching. With leaves falling they can be easier to spot as they move through the treetops, foraging for the autumn harvest of seeds, nuts and berries. They will also be spending more time on the ground, building up stores of food in preparation for the colder months ahead.Mel added: “During the survey week you could visit a well-known squirrel stomping ground to help us keep our records up-to-date. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.gallowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Jon Marshall, Zero Waste Scotlands recycling sector manager, and chief executive Iain Gulland want recycled food waste to be used to power vehicles, just like the DeLorean car in the movie Back to the Future. \"  \"  Food waste really can power cars like in the s’ Back to the Future movies viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"“Or,you’re feeling adventurous, you could visit a woodland where few sightings have been recorded before. “The more information we receive from the public, the better our understanding of Scotland’s squirrel populations will be.” Gordon Buchanan, wildle filmmaker and Scottish Wildle Trust ambassador, said: “The red squirrel is an iconic Scottish species. “Thanks to conservation efforts their populations are beginning to stabilise, but their future is still under threat. “Taking part in the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey is a really simple way you can help.”The results of the Great Scottish Squirrel Survey will be published later this year.

The labels specy what can be recycled at kerbside and give details of where more information can be found.Crews will aim to cover all recycling bins by the end of the month, but stickers will also be available for residents at household recycling centres .More information about recycling can be found on the council’s website, from checking recycling bin day to an A-Z recycling guide and what happens to the materials afterwards.Councillor Peter Argyle, chair of the infrastructure services committee, said: “Recycle Week is a great opportunity for householders to make a positive contribution to Aberdeenshire’s recycling efforts. “We hope the information provided during the week will encourage residents to make a push towards increased recycling rates.”For a complete guide on the materials that can be recycled in Aberdeenshire, see the A-Z guide at http:bit.ly AshireAZ.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..!

This year Orkney boasts seven venues — some of which are participating for the first time,As far as local people are concerned, Doors Open Days is about getting into buildings for free and seeing things that you don#t often see. If buildings are usually charging an entrance fee they can take part by offering to open for free,The event benefits the organisations or venues by attracting more visitors. It helps them by becoming more involved in the community, as a volunteer or a visitor, and enhancing appreciation of local architecture and local heritage.The seven venues taking part in Orkney all have free entry.

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And so surely it is both appropriate and welcome that it seeks to make its expertise and experience available to those trying to save lives in other countries, and supports those efforts where they can “Much of the work the RNLI is doing overseas appears to be targeted at young people and children – helping making the water safer for them # and that is something I would fully support.“As someone who has, from a very early age, helped raise funds for the RNLI, I am proud of its work home and abroad, and I thank every crew member, volunteer, fundraiser and supporter for all their efforts.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They reported their exercise every two years.Increasing consumption of any type of nut was linked to less long-term weight gain and a lower risk of becoming obese.Increasing nut consumption by half a serving a day was associated with a lower risk of putting on two or more kilos over any four-year period.Substituting snacks such as chocolates, pastries, pies and donuts with half a serving of nuts was associated with staving off weight gain of between . and .kg in any four-year period.A daily half serving increase of walnuts was linked to a % lower risk of obesity.The findings remained after taking account of changes in diet and lestyle, such as exercise and alcohol intake.The researchers say that, as the study is observational, it cannot establish cause.They suggest that chewing nuts takes more effort than eating fast food, while the high fibre content can make people feel full for longer.Nut fibre binds well to fat in the gut, meaning more calories are excreted.The study is published in the online journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention  Health.copy -.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective. From IPCC  Report , Summary for Policymakers, Paragraph SPM .. .“Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale#, and.#Effective mitigation will not be achievedinidual agents advance their own interests independently.#The current, tawdry campaign is disreputable. It is based on Old Testament-style, apocalyptic prophecies, cynically intended to raise public alarm for grubby, political purposes and the Green Party is up to their ocksters in it.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses.

Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them.

Gareth’s identity was revealed in a News Letter article and the story was picked up by This Morning who invited him and his we Kirsty to appear on the show this morning.Lea also appeared on the show along with her sister Shannon and niece Akeelah, who slept soundly throughout the interview. Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We were contacted by the show on Sunday and the next morning we were on the This Morning sofa.“We had so much more we wanted to say but it was tight for time but so nice to continue to be able to talk about Hannah.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"thomas has been behind the lens for","story":"TO many people in North Belfast Thomas McMullan is a familiar face in the local community.A multiple award-winning photographer, Thomas has been the man behind the camera for  years ever since the North Belfast News started publication in .Hailing from Chatham Street in old Ardoyne, Thomas was born in  in the Mater Hospital on the Crumlin Road and came from a family of three brothers. He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38519427.ece/e923f/BINARY/courts%20gavel.jpg","title":"jon tonge another divisive week in brexitland and theres no sign of fog clearing","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It ought to be a resignation issue but wont, given the proximity of a general election in late Autumn or early .Amid the noise, bluster and faux outrage, there will be a sizeable number of Labour MPs privately anxious to avoid a resumption of Parliament. Why would they want to be dragged from the fun of a party conference by the Brighton seaside to hear parliamentary arguments played on a repeat loop for the last year  While it is unlikely that the Supreme Court, should it find against the Government, will determine the date Parliament should resume, the pressure for an immediate restoration would be huge. That could take a wrecking ball to the Conservatives gathering in Manchester at the end of this month.In truth, Parliament prorogued is probably as effective as Parliament sitting. MPs wasted the last year voting against all options. The Liberal Democrats have now decided that all options are off now, anyway. They will simply cancel Brexit. This from a party that supported a referendum.Any chance of a deal will owe precious little to Westminster, where posturing and pantomime had long displaced any serious consideration of the issues at stage. Instead, progress will be a product of often fractious but, of late, somewhat more measured exchanges involving the UK and Irish governments, the EU and the DUP.Arlene Fosters party made a signicant concession in accepting all-Ireland - in effect, EU - alignment in agriculture and food, butthat is the limit to the DUPs movement, there is still huge distance to travel. More than % of cross-border trade is in other sectors and the demand for the backstop remains for those aspects.There is a reasonable chance that the backstop is re-labelled as it is politically toxic - but a renaming is not a dispelling. Resolving the issues will require much more moderation and considerable fudging.Assurances might be given to the DUP that any checking of goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to, at most, token checks. A revival of Stormont could be talked up as part of a triple-lock on any EU expansion of regulations covering all-Ireland trade, involving the Westminster and Dublin parliaments and the Northern Ireland Assembly. Some concessions to the technocratic approach to customs and regulations checks offered by the Alternative Arrangements Commission might be forthcoming. The sum of modest parts might be sufficient to claim victory in modying the Withdrawal Agreementor upholding all its principles .The DUP needs a win to take to its own party conference at the end of October, which, like Sinn Feins Ard Fheis three weeks later, might take on the appearance of a pre-election rally. Given the DUPs long-standing opposition to the backstop, the party needs to show how it made a substantial contribution to its modication. Bilateral discussions between Arlene Foster and the Taoiseach indicate that neither party wants to be responsible for a no-deal failure. Leo Varadkar has got most of his electorate onside in the blame game.

said.“TheCommission has been very clear in saying that the twin objectives are to do just that, ensure that there’s no infrastructure on the border, but also to protect us in the single market.“If you

“He also said that they could not be on the border, there could not be a hard border between North and South, and also that we cannot go back in history, that we cannot allow history to repeat itself.“We know what happened in the past when we had checks along the border and infrastructure along the border.“So anything that we’re doing now, particularly in the event of no-deal, will not replicate the backstop, it will not be as good as what we have negotiated now.“But it will hopefully meet the twin objectives to prevent border infrastructure and also to protect the single market and our place in it.”Her comments come as the Irish premier Leo Varadkar is due to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday in New York.Mr Johnson, who has demanded that the backstop should be scrapped, met Mr Varadkar in Dublin two weeks ago.Ms McEntee said that Mr Varadkar will outline the Irish Government’s concerns.She added: “My understanding, and I think similar to their meeting two weeks ago, which was a very positive meeting, the Taoiseach will, yet again, outline our concerns, not just in terms of Brexit, but obviously the fact that we don’t have a ing Executive in Northern Ireland, which is crucial to all of this.“But he will also say that we are very willing, we’re very open and ready to accept any proposals that the UK may have, to replace or attempt to deal with  the backstop.“We know the papers were presented to the Commission last Thursday, they weren’t actual legal papers, they did not fulfil the same requirements as the backstop, so we need more.“There is still a huge gap between what we need and what has been presented by the UK, and in order to reach an agreement by October  we really do need to see more progress from the

Labour IS a Remain party. I will continue campaigning with @LondonLabour to give the public the final say and stop Brexit.— Sadiq KhanSeptember , It was announced this motion was defeated following a show of hands among delegates allowed to vote.Wendy Nichols, who was chairing the afternoon session of Labour conference, said there was disagreement in the group on stage looking at proceedings.As delegates cast their votes, the chairwoman Ms Nichols could be seen having a discussion with Labour general secretary Jennie Formby.So @jeremycorbyn Brexit position triumphed at @UKLabour conference this afternoon. The message is, despite the chatter from commentators, the party is determined to unite behind its leader.— Diane AbbottSeptember , Announcing the result, Ms Nichols said: “Sorry I thought it was one way… and Jennie said something , so.“Yes, that was lost.”Further confusion followed, with Ms Nichols reiterating the motion was rejected despite appeals for a formal card vote by some members.Andrew Lewin, of the Remain Labour campaign, said the party now faced going into a general election without a clear position.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Some delegates were left disappointed by the outcome He told the PA news agency: “We are going to be unable to answer the question ‘are you for Remain or Leave’.“Obviously, lots of good people and senior people like Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry etc. are going to say inidually, but that’s not what the public will see.“The public will see the leader – and therefore by definition a party – that can’t make its mind up and I think that will be really damaging.”Vote at Labour Party conference decisively decides the a decision on Labour’s Brexit position should be decided AFTER a general election. And they want to run the country. 🤦🏽‍♂️— James Cleverly MPSeptember , London mayor Sadiq Khan said Labour is a Remain party and that he did not believe the decision “reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of Labour members”.But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the result showed the party is “determined to unite behind its leader”.Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly accused Labour of having “dodged” making any decision on Brexit and claimed the party had proved that “all they offer is more of the same – more talk, more indecision and more pointless delay”.“It is now official Labour policy to delay Brexit until at least  and even longerthe EU demand it.“Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will get Brexit done by  October, whatever the circumstances, and get on with delivering the change that people voted for.”The failure of Labours Composite  motion underlines one simple fact: Corbyns Labour will not fight for Remainers.The Liberal Democrats will. Weve led the fight against Brexit for  years  our membership is surging. Help us stop Brexit now https:t.co MpXkNJxv— Liberal DemocratsSeptember , Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, whose anti-Brexit party hopes to benefit from Labour’s neutral stance, said: “Jeremy Corbyn has again shown a total lack of leadership on Brexit and settled on yet another fudge on the biggest issue facing our country.“Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly had the opportunity to put the full force of Labour behind a Remain position, but he has once again shown today that he is a Brexiteer at heart.“He is determined to negotiate a Brexit dealLabour win an election, despite all the evidence that there is no Brexit deal that is good for our economy, our NHS and our security.“By refusing to say how the Labour Party would campaign in a second referendum, Jeremy Corbyn is letting down the millions of people who want to see the UK remain in the EU.”"},{"url":null,"title":"labour pledges to halve food bank usage in first year in government","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry trades union council calls public back youth climate strike","story":"Derry Trades Union Council have said they are to stand with the Youth Strike  Climate Derry organisation this Friday fighting for climate justice.DTUC have called on everyone to mobilise on September  and attend the Youth Strike  Climate Rally, Guildhall Square, for pm.Niall McCarroll, Chairman of DTUC said: \"Young people today are both politically and environmentally aware, the young people organising this event are an inspiration and deserve huge credit for this campaign, however, for any campaign to success it needs support and a radical mass mobilization to get behind the campaign objectives.We need to fight for our planets survival but we also need to look at our habits as humans and the damage our le choices and lestyles are creating.\"More than  percent of the Amazon rainforest is already gone, and much more is severely threatened as the destruction continues.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American.

Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"montgomery couple aiming high

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

We were contacted by the show on Sunday and the next morning we were on the This Morning sofa.“We had so much more we wanted to say but it was tight for time but so nice to continue to be able to talk about Hannah.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

They reported their exercise every two years.Increasing consumption of any type of nut was linked to less long-term weight gain and a lower risk of becoming obese.Increasing nut consumption by half a serving a day was associated with a lower risk of putting on two or more kilos over any four-year period.Substituting snacks such as chocolates, pastries, pies and donuts with half a serving of nuts was associated with staving off weight gain of between . and .kg in any four-year period.A daily half serving increase of walnuts was linked to a % lower risk of obesity.The findings remained after taking account of changes in diet and lestyle, such as exercise and alcohol intake.The researchers say that, as the study is observational, it cannot establish cause.They suggest that chewing nuts takes more effort than eating fast food, while the high fibre content can make people feel full for longer.Nut fibre binds well to fat in the gut, meaning more calories are excreted.The study is published in the online journal BMJ Nutrition, Prevention  Health..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: The key to keeping trim could be nuts article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London. Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
