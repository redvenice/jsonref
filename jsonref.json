Come on, it\u0027s staying on your finger, it\u0027ll be fine, let\u0027s go,\u0027 John remembered telling his new fiance.   Officers had posted these surveillance images of the couple and a photo of the engagement ring on Twitter as they tried to find Daniella and John, who had already returned to the UK \u0027So, your fault,\u0027 Ellen remarked as the audience laughed. The couple then went out and walked around Times Square. At one point John went to grab Daniella\u0027s hand and the ring suddenly slipped off. \u0027In slow motion, I can still visualize this,\u0027 he said. \u0027It bounces once, it bounces twice, and then right into the grate.\u0027 \u0027It was every girl\u0027s nightmare,\u0027 Daniella added. The couple said many people stopped on the street to console them, including a little girl who gave Daniella a hug and told her not to worry. \u0027I was sobbing,\u0027 John said. \u0027I never want to see Daniella that upset in my life again.\u0027 \u0027From joy and happiness to absolute devastation. And I\u0027m trying to pull up at this grate, trying my best to pull this thing up - those things don\u0027t move!\u0027           A friend of the couple saw the NYPD\u0027s tweets on Twitter and they soon learned of the happy news, which the NYPD shared in tweets Daniella then called over an NYPD officer, who radioed for more help. \u0027They sealed off the place, they got the special equipment out, opened up the grate, down there - torches - having a look,\u0027 John recalled. \u0027After, it must have been an hour-and-a-half to two hours, they just said Sorry.\u0027  The couple were absolutely devastated, but little did they know two police officers had gone back to look for the ring again the next day. Priyanka Chopra\u0027s first wedding gift is extravagant $80K...\u0027Her Majesty has seen it all\u0027: Royal insiders urge Meghan to...Share this articleOfficers posted surveillance images of the couple and a photo of the engagement ring on Twitter as they asked for help locating Daniella and John.  The couple said they now plan to enjoy being engaged for a bit and are thinking of a June 2020 wedding. But before they left, Ellen presented them with one final gift - a check for $10,000 to help with their wedding. Now that\u0027s a second proposal the couple will be sure to never forget.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/13/15/283E58AE00000578-6492439-image-a-29_1544715384079.jpg","title":"Ed Miliband rolls ed stone mocks Camerons Christmas card","story":"    Ed Miliband\u0027s card shows the grinning Labour MP in a Christmas jumper jumping out from behind a monument which looks like his ill-fated \u0027ed stone\u0027 (pictured)            The Labour MP took aim at David Cameron\u0027s infamous 2015 tweet (pictured) warning Britain faced an \u0027inescapable\u0027 choice between stability with the Tories or \u0027chaos\u0027 with Labour          Jeremy Corbyn unveiled his Christmas card - of his beloved cat called El Gato - Spanish for \u0027the cat\u0027 Teflon Theresa and her ever-present \u0027rock\u0027: PM\u0027s husband\u0027s...Corbyn STILL refuses to call Commons no-confidence vote in...Share this articleHis card won plaudits on Twitter as voters hailed the hilarious card and said Mr Miliband had \u0027owned\u0027 David Cameron and taken an early lead in the Christmas card competition.Mr MIliband, the MP for Doncaster North, struggled to connect with voters while labour leader  and was pilloried for awkwardly eating a bacon sandwich.  But he has gained a reputation for his wit since returning to the backbenches after losing  the 2015 General Election to Mr Cameron.Last year he put out a  Christmas card showing himself in a leather jacket astride a motorbike tucking into a bacon sandwich under some festive holly.Mr Cameron has been widely mocked for sending the infamously poorly aged tweet warning of the \u0027chaos\u0027 which would ensue if Labour were elected in 2015.The Tories won a majority after promising to hold a referendum on Britain\u0027s membership of the EU - triggering what has proved to be one of the most turbulent and  bitterly isive peopled of politics in modern British history.But just over a year later Mr Cameron had dramatically quit as PM after losing the Brexit vote in a campaign which has left the country bitterly ided.And the past two years has seen the Tory party plunged into a bloody civil war which nearly saw Theresa May ousted as PM yesterday, while the crunch Brexit talks have lurched from one crisis to another.            Theresa May and Philip unveiled the No10 Christmas cards - they are designs drawn by children in the PM\u0027s local constituency           Ed Miliband (pictured in 2015 with his notorious \u0027ed stone\u0027 - a rock with pledges scrawled on it which became symbolic of his inability to connect with voters ) has gained a reputation for being a joker since he quit as Labour leader and returned to the backbenches "},{"url":null,"title":"Woman 58 left battered bruised bundled car","story":"    The injuries suffered by the 58-year-old victim of a kidnapping and assault, who was held in the boot of her own car by two menShe remains in hospital as medical staff treat her injuries.

Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage. Pictured: Ukrainetz with her mother Evelyn and her three children           Ukrainetz says she believes Maurice, 4th Baron Fermoy (pictured) first saw her actress mother on stage in 1943 and fell hopelessly in love before beginning an affair that lasted until his death in 1955          The 75-year-old wants to dig up the remains of Maurice\u0027s twin brother Francis, who is buried in New York, and compare his DNA to hers to prove she really is Princess Diana\u0027s aunt   Ukrainetz says she has attempted to contact the Fermoy family, Princess Diana\u0027s brother Charles, Earl Spencer and the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex but has been largely ignored.She told DailyMailTV: \u0027I am their flesh and blood. Why can\u0027t they accept me? They accept Meghan who is a orcee.\u0027The royals have come a long way in that they have accepted others. Yet myself, who is blood related, they want nothing to do with. It makes me angry.\u0027Ukrainetz was born Ann Rudderforth in Kings Lynn, England, on November 22, 1943 to Evelyn – an actress who was the leading light of the local theater company.Ukrainetz says she believes Maurice, 4th Baron Fermoy first saw her mother on stage the same year and fell hopelessly in love before beginning an affair that lasted until his death in 1955.Growing up, she says there were regular Friday visits from the \u0027insurance man\u0027, who she says she later realized was Maurice.She said: \u0027He was introduced to me as the insurance man and he would come quite often on a Friday and we would have to get all dolled up.\u0027My grandmother would take a walk because she lived with my mom and dad – she was bombed out during the war – and I would sit on his knee.\u0027I thought that was a little strange when I got older – why am I bouncing around on this man\u0027s lap when he\u0027s the insurance man? But it seemed that my mom and he had a very close relationship and so I felt it was OK.\u0027He would always bring some little toy. I remember he bought me a bicycle for my birthday. I think it was blue - a blue Raleigh bicycle. I just loved it.\u0027           Ukrainetz says she loved growing up in rural England but that changed in 1955 when Maurice died and her family relocated to Canada. There, her actress mother Evelyn (left)  became a book keeper and raised her only daughter away from the rest of their English family           In 1995, her mother Evelyn died. Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage (pictured)          A portion of the letter reads: \u0027My dearest, darling Ann, I know one day you will have this letter in your possession, maybe after I have passed from this world. Please try to understand. I just have to get this off my chest. Charlie was not your biological father. I fell in love with Lord Fermoy and we had you as a result. He was married and I was just a commoner\u0027But her mother, Evelyn, was married - to Charles, a foreman at a local timber mill - and so was Maurice: to Ruth Roche, a confidante and lady-in-waiting to the Queen Mother, and the mother of his son Edmund and daughters Mary and Frances.Frances – who Ukrainetz believes is her half-sister – later went on to marry John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, with whom she had a son Charles and three daughters, including Princess Diana.          Evelyn was married at the time of the affair to Charles, a foreman at a local timber mill According to Ukrainetz, her family appeared to be of modest means but always had money – given to them, she believes, by her aristocratic biological father.She also attended events at Sandringham – the royal family\u0027s Norfolk home – and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, at the behest, she claims, of Maurice, who had a house on the estate.But although she says she loved growing up in rural England all that changed in 1955 when Maurice died and her family relocated to Canada.There, her actress mother Evelyn became a book keeper and raised her only daughter away from the rest of their English family, including Ukrainetz\u0027s grandmother who had to be left behind.In 1964, Ukrainetz met and married her husband Len, with whom she went on to have three children, although the couple are now orced.A year later, the pair left Canada for Detroit, Michigan, before moving briefly to Los Angeles and then Escondido, a small city 30 miles north of San Diego, where the family still live.In 1995, her mother Evelyn died. Four years later, while going through her possessions, Ukrainetz discovered a letter hidden inside a music program that revealed the truth about her parentage.           While Ann\u0027s mother Evelyn was having an affair with Maurice, he was married to Ruth Roche (pictured together in 1933)           Another find was a series of letters from Maurice to Evelyn, including one that referenced her birth and commiserated with her mother over the pain. It said: \u0027I am so sorry the birth of our Ann caused you so much pain. I feel it too. I love you so very much\u0027          Another note addressed to \u0027my precious Rose, Evelyn\u0027 asked if she could bring Ann to a house party and that his driver could take them home afterwards   Evelyn also revealed how Maurice had been able to secretly snatch moments with his illegitimate daughter          Ukrainetz said: \u0027He would always bring some little toy. I remember he bought me a bicycle for my birthday. I think it was blue - a blue Raleigh bicycle. I just loved it\u0027          The confession read in part: \u0027I fell in love with Lord Fermoy and we had you as a result. He was married and I was just a commoner. There was nothing we could do. We stayed in close touch and he loved you very much\u0027 (pictured Ann Ukrainetz) It said: \u0027My dearest, darling Ann, I know one day you will have this letter in your possession, maybe after I have passed from this world.\u0027Please try to understand.

He was married and I was just a commoner.\u0027There was nothing we could do. We stayed in close touch and he loved you very much.\u0027Evelyn also revealed how Maurice had been able to secretly snatch moments with his illegitimate daughter.She wrote: \u0027Remember we went to a lot of functions? This was so your father could see you without creating a scandal. I wanted you to know because this makes you a \u0027\u0027lady\u0027\u0027.\u0027I wanted to tell you so much in person, but I lacked the courage.\u0027Another find was a series of letters from Maurice to Evelyn, including one that referenced her birth and commiserated with her mother over the pain.It said: \u0027I am so sorry the birth of our Ann caused you so much pain.

I don\u0027t like to do that, I really don\u0027t want to do it. But they leave me no option. Just not even responding to anything is callous.

How do you dispose of someone and bury them in the basement and pour concrete over them and nobody knows about it?\u0027 his brother Steven Carroll, 61, said.  The veteran\u0027s death is being now probed as a homicide. But cops say they may never know just who was behind his death. Mike\u0027s mother Dorothy, provided vague details about how his father just left one day for a pack of cigarettes and never returned. Mike says his family never filed a missing persons report and moved on with their lives. If she had any secrets, she took them to the grave with her when she passed away in 1998. Mike said a person who could have known something about his father\u0027s death would have been Richard Darress, his mother\u0027s second husband who moved in not long after George Carroll died. However Darress later moved to Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and passed away in June at the age of 77. Mike said: \u0027I\u0027m trying to avoid pointing a finger at this point\u0027. According to records, Dorothy orced Darress in 1983 after she  suspected him of cheating on her and threw him out of the house four years earlier.In 2000, a woman he was married to obtained a temporary order of protection against him ahead of their orce, according to court records cited by Fox News. He was ordered to stay away from her and surrender any guns.          Cops ruled George Carroll\u0027s death a homicide. Mike\u0027s mother Dorothy told her four kids that George went out for cigarettes then never returned home. If she had any secrets on his death, she took them to the grave when she passed away in 1998   Police and Mike Carroll say that Dorothy\u0027s second husband Richard Darress, who moved in not long after George Carroll died, would have been a good person to question. He passed away earlier this year Mike purchased the Suffolk County home before his mother died and employed the help of ghost hunters and psychics to see if the mystery of his father could be solved. They pointed to an energy sensed in the basement of the Lake Grove home.

Under his leadership, Tesla would go on to sell 50,000 Model S cars in 2015. The company soon became worth $7billion and Musk\u0027s star  continued to rise, landing him spots on The Simpsons and Big Bang Theory as he racked up five houses in Los Angeles\u0027 swanky Bel Air neighborhood - for a total of $72million.  Musk - who has five children with first wife Justine Wilson - also began dating celebrities, marrying actress Talulah Riley before later dating Heard. \u0027He went from nerd famous to Hollywood famous,\u0027 said one former longtime executive. \u0027It changes you when you suddenly become a celebrity.\u0027Executives revealed to WIRED that they began reading tabloids. If there were reports of trouble in Musk\u0027s relationship, they held off on telling him any bad news.           When Elon Musk announced the Model 3 (pictured), a new electric sedan that would sell for just $35,000, he sent shockwaves through Wall Street - and through AmericaBut things were still going well in Tesla, thanks in part to the fact that Musk was surrounded by people who had been there for a while and knew \u0027how to push back on him\u0027, according to one former executive. \u0027He listened to us when we said he needed to dial it down,\u0027 they added. \u0027But then the Model 3 happened and everyone started leaving, and then everything started falling apart.\u0027 The original plan for the Model 3 was already ambitious. Tesla had sold fewer than 150,000 cars total. Now it was planning to make 5,000 Model 3 cars a week. \u0027You are now working at a different company,\u0027 Doug Field, the company\u0027s senior vice president of engineering, told his staff. \u0027Everything has changed.\u0027 Little did everyone know that Musk had been dreaming of far more changes - inspired by a literal dream. He wanted a manufacturing plant that was fully automated, one in which robots built everything at high speed and conveyor belts delivered parts at exactly the right time.Musk wanted his departments to completely rebuild their manufacturing plants for the Model 3, telling them: \u0027We\u0027re going to build the machine that builds the machine\u0027.The announcement completely shocked the company. Engineers began handing in their notices as executives tried to push back on Musk\u0027s plan. But he wouldn\u0027t relent. Whenever someone raised an alarm, Musk would pull their manager aside - sometimes to reassign them, sometimes to fire them, it is claimed.          But Musk sent shockwaves through his own company when he declared he wanted the Model 3 manufacturing plant (pictured) to be fully automated, one in which robots built everything \u0027If you were the kind of person who was likely to push back, you got disinvited, because VPs didn\u0027t want anyone pissing off Elon,\u0027 said one former executive. \u0027People were scared that someone would question something.\u0027 As the company started burning through an estimated $100million a week, Musk only became more and more frustrated. In one meeting, Musk was so furious he broke a phone, it is claimed. In another, he angrily called an executive who hadn\u0027t attended because his wife had recently given birth. He reportedly once refused to interview a job candidate because they were wearing blue shoes. \u0027Everyone came to work each day wondering if it was going to be their last day,\u0027 one former executive said. Another remembered Musk coming to work and declaring \u0027I\u0027ve got to fire someone today\u0027. \u0027I\u0027d say, No, you don\u0027t and he\u0027d say, No, no. I just do. I\u0027ve got to fire somebody,\u0027 the executive recalled. Fast-forward a year and the company was still severely struggling. And now customers were asking for their Model 3 deposits back.           Musk\u0027s firings at Tesla began to accelerate, at one point becoming so bad that one manager forbade his staff from going near their leader\u0027s desk. Pictured is the Gigafactory 2 in New YorkMusk had called on the employee over an issue with the production line, telling him simply \u0027This doesn\u0027t work!\u0027 \u0027Did you do this?\u0027 Musk then asked. The employee had never met Musk before, and he had no idea what exactly Musk was talking about. \u0027You mean, program the robot? Or design the tool?\u0027 the engineer asked. \u0027Did you f*****g do this?\u0027 Musk reportedly asked again. \u0027I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re referring,\u0027 the engineer told him, an apology in his voice. \u0027You\u0027re a f*****g idiot,\u0027 Musk allegedly replied. \u0027Get the f**k out and don\u0027t come back!\u0027   A few minutes later, the employee found out he had been officially fired.  \u0027We called it the idiot bit,\u0027 one senior executive told WIRED. \u0027If you said something wrong or made one mistake or rubbed him the wrong way, he would decide you\u0027re an idiot and there was nothing that could change his mind.\u0027 \u0027It started to feel like every day you expected to be fired,\u0027 another added. \u0027There was this constant feeling of dread.\u0027 One spokesman told WIRED that Musk only fired those who were \u0027underperforming\u0027.           Then, in August, Musk sent out a tweet that would cost him $20million and his chairmanship of Tesla\u0027s board          The story only got weirder as rapper Azealia Banks claimed she had witnessed Musk breaking down to his girlfriend Grimes (pictured together) over the tweet. She even claimed he sent it while on acid\u0027Elon cares very deeply about the people who work at his companies,\u0027 they said in a statement. \u0027That is why, although it is painful, he sometimes takes the difficult step of firing people who are underperforming.\u0027 \u0027In order for Tesla to succeed, we must have extremely high standards and work harder and smarter than everyone else.\u0027 \u0027Sometimes, when we feel it\u0027s important to the success of our mission, that means people are let go.\u0027 Eventually 700 people would be let go, and more than 36 Tesla vice presidents or higher-ranking staff would leave the company - including the company\u0027s chief information officer and vice presidents of manufacturing and engineering. \u0027It felt like the adults were leaving the building,\u0027 one senior employee said. \u0027There was really no one left would could push back on Elon anymore.\u0027  Meanwhile, Musk\u0027s interviews were only getting more and more bizarre, even telling a Rolling Stone reporter that he was in \u0027severe emotional pain\u0027.\u0027I will never be happy without having someone,\u0027 he added. \u0027Going to sleep alone kills me.\u0027 By April, Musk finally admitted that \u0027excessive automation\u0027 was his mistake. Two months later, Tesla finally hit its goal of 5,000 Model 3 cars in one week. Musk was over the moon, telling employees that Tesla had finally become a \u0027real car company\u0027. And yet, he personally continued to spiral, it is claimed.His tweeting became rampant that summer as he called one critic a \u0027sanctimonious idiot\u0027 and told a Buzzfeed reporter in an email that he was a \u0027f*****g a**hole\u0027.   Musk called a cave er who helped rescue the trapped Thailand boys that he was a pedophile, and told one Wall Street analyst he had asked a \u0027boneheaded question\u0027 during a company call about Tesla\u0027s latest earnings.        Could Elon Musk save the jobs of GM workers?

The group favours one that just sends speeding drivers a dashboard warning.Cuerder confirmed to the  that Acea had been made aware of the figures, and TRL’s objections to the claims about SLI.Despite this, Acea has continued to use the “effective alternative” phrase in its lobby material, and the wording has been inserted into nine amendments to the EU package now being proposed by three MEPs.Antonio Avenoso, the ETSC director, told the : “These new vehicle safety standards will have a hugely important impact on reducing deaths on European roads. So it’s critical that the political discussion is not frustrated by misleading information.“That a handful of MEPs are trying to copy-paste this into the legislation itself is very worrying. The price would be paid in lives lost that otherwise would not have been.”None of the three rightwing MEPs proposing the amendments – Jacqueline Foster, Andor Deli or Massimiliano Salini – immediately responded to requests for comment.Acea declined to discuss its interactions with MEPs or its reasons for repeating the disputed claims. Acea says on its website: “ISA technology holds promise for the future.” However, a spokesperson said it “still shows too many false warnings due to incorrect road signs and outdated speed limit information – something that most consumers will not accept.”ISA, which is used by some Ford cars, employs traffic sign recognition systems and GPS satellite to adjust car speeds. It turns itself off in inclement conditions and can be manually over-ridden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb76cadd18336d0f10c5a8b5ca657d4aec449519/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3209c10c655f5bb567451b0bfb43ca3","title":"what would a city that is safe for women look like","story":"Most cities have not been designed with women’s safety in mind but, from Egypt to Rwanda, new technology, design and education are reducing the threat of violence on the streetSexual violence has rarely been so high on the news agenda. Since allegations against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein started to emerge in October last year, the global problem has finally become a mainstream issue. The United Nations has estimated that one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence, with 120 million girls around the world having been forced into sex acts.The repercussions go beyond the physical and psychological toll on iniduals who have been attacked. Harassment and fear of violence can impede free movement of girls and women and stop them reaching their full potential, both socially and economically. “If women feel afraid,” says Laura Somoggi, who manages the annual Womanity award for the prevention of violence against women, “it could undermine their ability to work or go to school or university which affects their empowerment, their rights.” Fear of attack is a bar to women escaping poverty.On a recent visit to Delhi, Somoggi witnessed the long-term impacts first-hand. “If girls are harassed and tell their parents about it, their parents will tell them not to go to school. They’re not going to try to solve the problem. It’s a massive social issue.”Part of the problem is that cities have been “planned by men, for men”, says Somoggi, who lives in London but is originally from São Paulo.While sprawling metropolises cannot simply be razed and rebuilt, a number of measures can be taken to make streets feel safer and to keep women more secure when moving around the city. And more than ever, women are being consulted in planning new urban developments.In June, a panel of world experts polled on global women’s issues by the Thomson Reuters Foundation found India to be the most dangerous country for women. The vicious gang rape and murder of the medical student Jyoti Singh on a Delhi bus in 2012 brought women on to the streets to protest, and along with their fury, grief and fear came powerful ideas for change.In 2013, Kalpana Viswanath co-founded SafetiPin, an app that aims to help women stay safe by letting users rate streets and areas for safety criteria such as lighting, visibility, people density, gender ersity, security and transportation. It also aggregates safety data, partly provided by its users, for use by local government and planners. SafetiPin now has 51,000 points of data for Delhi alone, and offers users “safest routes”, helping them navigate the city with less risk.Another function of the app allows women to have someone they trust track their journey. “We find a lot of women are able to travel at night using these two features,” says Viswanath. “It gives them confidence to travel around the city.” And the more women venture out, the busier – and safer – the streets become.To help make the app’s data comprehensive, SafetiPin’s crowdsourced data is augmented using photography. “We use an app on a windscreen of a moving car which automatically takes photographs every 50 metres,” says Viswanath. “We map the entire city using photographs, and supplement that with user data.” Google Earth and Street View are also consulted for extra perspectives but SafetiPin’s data is dynamic, Viswanath says, responding to a constantly changing city.The free app can be used anywhere in the world. So far there has been significant participation in 50 cities (25 in India) and SafetiPin is advising local authorities or organisations in 10 of them. In Hanoi, for instance, says Viswanath: “They’re building a new metro line and before building it they’ve asked us to do an audit of where they’re going to have their stations. They’re including women’s safety in the design.” In Bogotá, SafetiPin data has been consulted to make bike trails safer, “determining where to improve lighting, place CCTV and place bike stands so women will feel comfortable using them at night,” says Viswanath. Next stop: South Africa – thanks to winning this year’s Womanity award. SafetiPin will team up with a number of local organisations to map areas of safety – and are particularly keen to address the unsafe minibus taxis that many women have to use to travel to work.Collective Point 6 is a cooperative of feminist architects, sociologists and urban planners who have been trying to build equality into Barcelona’s streets for a decade. Visibility is key, says member Sara Ortiz, but there’s more to it than lighting. “In well-lit places where there is no activity, no eyes on the street, people are not going to feel safe anyway,” she says.City streets are riddled with dark corners and obstacles that make perfect hiding places for potential attackers to hide. In Barcelona, says Ortiz, large recycling and rubbish containers, parking areas and overgrown vegetation can be tweaked or repositioned to reduce lurking spots. The collective recommends vegetation is no higher than one metre, so you can see behind it, and that trees are maintained so as not to block lighting. Corners, stairs, alleyways, porches and other built aspects are harder to tackle retrospectively, but in San Sebastián on the north coast, says Ortiz, “they have recently approved a bylaw to ensure all the entrances to new housing buildings are on street level and avoid creating hiding places.”And on occasions where creepy old developments are to be rebuilt, the collective is ready to make sure they become spaces for all ages and genders. One such project was the redevelopment of Plaça de la Llibertat in a municipality close to Barcelona, which was built, says Ortiz, “in the 60s or 70s when the trend was to make different levels and stairs and walls. It was a square women used to avoid.” Local women were consulted on the redevelopment, she says, “and now it’s more open, and a variety of people use the square during the day and cross it during the night.” It is more pram-friendly, too.Another key aspect, says Ortiz, is how women are represented in the streets. Waiting alone at a bus stop displaying a sexist advertisement can feel like a hostile environment rather than a place of respect for women. To combat this, across Spain there have been pushes to name streets after women or female-associated professions. Murals or public art, especially feminist works remembering the contribution of women, are encouraged. And Barcelona, says Ortiz, “has a campaign against gender violence that’s really visible in public spaces.”You can’t erase the threat of violence against women through city planning alone, especially in Nairobi, where, according to Amnesty International, more than half of residents live in informal communities. In these poorly serviced, cheek-by-jowl settlements, one in four girls are raped every year, according to the rape prevention organisation No Means No Worldwide. Its self-defence programme teaches girls how to identify a risk early on and attempt to stop it in its tracks for those situations when “no” is not respected, they learn physical skills to defend themselves and get away. Boys, meanwhile, are taught to challenge rape myths, seek consent and to recognise when women are in danger and stand up for them.In May, the Cairo-based actor and former activist Amal Fathy complained publicly about being sexually harassed on a visit to her bank. She uploaded a video detailing the event saying the government was failing to protect women, only to be promptly arrested. In September Fathy, a mother of a young child, was sentenced to two years in prison for possessing indecent material and spreading “false news”. She was also fined for making public insults.It was this climate of fear and denial that spawned HarassMap. Like SafetiPin, it crowdsources data from its users, only instead of safety ratings, it is for logging sexual harassment and violence. When a user reports an incident, they receive an automated response with advice and contacts to help get support and justice.The aim is to make plain the scale of the epidemic, show that it affects all women and it is not their fault, and reveal where harassment occurs (mostly in the streets and on public transport). Since the launch of HarassMap in 2010, sexual harassment has finally been recognised as a crime in Egypt, and the HarassMap concept has been replicated in 80 other countries, including Greece, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.In Cairo, women have felt emboldened to report more publicly on social media instead of the map. The #FirstTimeIWasHarassed hashtag launched last year, for instance, has allowed the HarassMap team to collate almost 2,000 testimonies of child sexual violence.But that doesn’t mean that life isn’t tough and dangerous for the estimated 5,000 female street hawkers in the country’s capital. So over the past four years, 16 safe mini-markets have been built to provide secure, organised workplaces for these women, complete with breastfeeding areas.Not only have the markets made their work safer, but operating from an organised market also helps the women earn better livings. And it is well established that improving economic status is the best protection against harassment and violence the world over. Additionally, says Emma Carine Uwantege of UN Women’s Rwanda office, Kigali “is supporting vulnerable women, especially street vendors, to organise into cooperatives and boost their businesses”.Transport, too, is being improved. “The city has been able to install CCTV cameras in some buses with voice alerts on sexual harassment and gender based violence,” she says. “There are also posters on ending sexual harassment and reporting of the crime.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ee72a96d3cf5f21e40e12562f3c3da2205e725/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d764a5e222d7ee457d851d13e83beb4","title":"dont pity theresa may immigration mess","story":"At the beginning of this week it was difficult to imagine that Theresa May could be any weaker, her party behave any more recklessly or the country appear any more shambolic in the eyes of the rest of the world. It’s only Thursday and we’re already setting new lows.In all of this, May strikes a tragic, hapless figure. Whenever she gambles – on a snap election, the meaningful vote – she loses. When she insists – there will be no snap election, there will be no delay in the meaningful vote – she reneges. I had to wait until the morning to write this because, although she insisted on Wednesday evening that she would carry on, there was no certainty that I wouldn’t wake up to discover that she had changed her mind overnight and bowed out.True, May won a vote of no confidence. But who, in all seriousness, is confident that she is remotely in control? She spent the weekend insisting she would push ahead with a vote she knew she was going to lose. It wasn’t much of a strategy, but there was integrity in it. But in the absence of plan B she opted for A – delaying the vote, going to Europe in search of a unicorn, coming back empty-handed only to have her own party turn on her. Now she vows to carry on after more than a third of her party’s MPs expressed no confidence in her leadership. One is reminded of her press conference after the U-turn on the dementia tax during the last election. “Nothing has changed,” she insisted, draining her credibility with each denial.Diminished, but not defeated, she is an object of pathos undeserving of our pity. This is Ms Windrush we’re talking about – the architect of the hostile environment who sent “Go Home” vans into erse areas to intimidate undocumented migrants. This is the prime minister who told Albert Thompson, who had lived in Britain legally for 44 years and was denied cancer treatment on the NHS because, like many in the Windrush generation, he couldn’t prove it, that he needed to “evidence his settled status”. She is not a victim of events but a participant and protagonist in them. She may have voted remain, but as home secretary she contributed to the climate of anti-immigrant fervour that helped make the leave victory possible.The fact that she has survived is really the most generous thing one can say about her at this stage. If survival were a superpower she would be an inaction hero. She’s still there. Since 8 June last year, the day she went to the country in search of a mandate and came back without a majority, we’ve been waiting for the other shoe to drop. Her political obituary was written then and has been stuck in a drawer ever since. Her days were numbered, even if no one knew precisely what that number would be. Whether she was dancing, coughing, powering on or flip-flopping, she has always been on borrowed time. But time is running out and those debts have come due.The snap election was called in the hope, verging on certainty, that she would be returned with an increased majority that would get her through a week like this one. It achieved the opposite. The reason the Tory party didn’t replace her then is because they couldn’t think of anyone who could do a better job. That’s still true. The motley array of carnival barkers, opportunists, self-aggrandisers, dullards and fantasists poised to step in on Thursday should she have stepped down revealed a shallow and eccentric bunch.And whoever might have replaced her would still have to engage with the fact that the Brexit sold during the referendum, for which there was barely a majority, does not exist. An image was conjured of Britain striding out of the EU in top hat and tails, like Jacob Rees-Mogg leaving the 21st century for an Old Etonian convention, towards a glorious past. Instead the two most likely scenarios at this point are that we fall out backwards, with our trousers round our ankles, and land on our behinds with no deal or crawl back in with our tail between our legs and ask for a second chance.The story of the last two years, like the last few days, has been reality intruding on rhetoric in the most inconvenient ways. The actual process of Brexit demands more pain or more compromise, or both, than most of those who voted to leave the EU are prepared to put up with.“There are two kinds of European nations,” the Danish finance minister Kristian Jensen said last year. “There are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realised they are small nations.” This is Britain’s most public and painful reckoning with its size and influence in its post-colonial state. It’s not pretty. This is why we can’t have nice things.Absent a change of government, the only thing we can be certain of is failure. Either Brexit will fail and we will stay in the EU or it will succeed in some way we either do not want or had not anticipated, and the country will fail. The politics, at this point, appears to be centred upon who will be blamed for that failure. Few in the polity seem to be talking about what success would look like beyond the narrow litigation of the close result two years ago. The leave victory was not only, in part, the product of alienation the way in which the political class has dealt with it has produced even more cynicism.So if May’s superpower is survival, her signature achievement has been to produce a deal that satisfies few, which she cannot get through parliament and which she cannot improve on. Given the demands of her party and her interpretation of the referendum, she could do no better. She was the best leader they had and she came back with the best deal a Tory leader could get. That’s the problem. For the Tories it doesn’t get any better than this. And nobody, including them, thinks it’s good enough.They no more have a plan for their party than they do for the country or they did for Brexit. Having won a parliamentary majority just once since 1992 – and held it for all of two years – they precipitated this entire fiasco in a self-indulgent bid for unity that backfired. What started as an internal wound is now infecting the country as a whole.The Tories have now proved themselves strategically incompetent at home and abroad. Having assembled a circular firing squad they decided to first shoot themselves in the foot. They have weakened their leader in parliament but not replaced her. They have weakened her hand in negotiations but have nothing to offer instead. The vote still stands no chance of being passed. It’s difficult to imagine how it could be worse than this. But then I thought that on Monday, and the week is not quite done yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4acff300fecb33bdf4f2a281d59cc001fac4606a/0_126_4269_2562/master/4269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fca72173861e86c8cde897f10f2b944","title":"erg theresa may brexit","story":"Of all the mad bastards out there, there are none madder than the Conservative party. The Tories’ self-indulgent bastardry is now at such thermonuclear levels that it could surely cause a rip in the very fabric of time and space itself, opening a portal into another dimension from which the dark lord Cthulhu may emerge to lead them. But can Cthulhu get a bold, creative and bespoke deal that takes back control of our borders, our money and our … I’m sorry, I can’t any more. Maybe tomorrow. The one thing I would say about the dark lord is that he’d probably realise taking back control of the Conservative party would be an effing start.And so to where we stand after a preposterous 24 hours – a midwinter night’s dream after which nothing has changed as far as the Brexit deadlock in parliament goes. But at least the ERG have been aggressively made love to by an ass.Theresa May has lived to die another day, after a Wednesday of almost mundane grotesquery. In some ways, you get so desensitised to watching Tories get their mark of Cain badge that distaste is merely the twitch of a phantom limb. At other times, it surges back. In order that they might vote for May, the Tory whip was restored to alleged inappropriate toucher and bully Charlie Elphicke, alleged bully and prolific extreme sexter Andrew Griffiths, and Cyrus the Virus from Con Air. Labour? Don’t ask me about Labour. I believe they’re having a meaningful-Brexit-position reveal party in late January.Anyway, before we go on, a word about the ERG. This was the second failed attempt to unseat May in three weeks, for a bunch of guys who’d be picked last for paintball and are led by rejected Paddington villain Jacob Rees-Mogg. According to some reports, the ERG nicknamed the room in which they coordinated Wednesday’s mission to terminate the prime minister The Kill Zone. Course they did. They’re hardmen. Zero Dark Have-We-Got-To-Thirty. Seal Team Six, only with actual seals, honking their fishy bullshit across the airwaves, apparently for all eternity.Tell you what, when you finally apply for your totemic blue passport, and the form asks for your country of residence, just put The Stygian Banterlands. That is the place we live now, shackled to the same lunatics in the Conservative party we’ve been tied to for three decades. Why couldn’t we get the pushing-the-boulder-up-the-hill punishment instead? Or the sword-hanging-above-our-head one? I’d take any of them all day long over having to clap eyes ever again on Andrew Bridgen, who should be playing Captain Hook’s dog in a Leicester panto, where small children could throw sweets at him every time he came on stage, wagging his vestigial tail.I know the ERG aren’t details men, but just for the record: in tactical military vocabulary, “the kill zone” defines a space within which killing occurs, being comprehensively covered by firepower, rather than one from which killing is masterminded. And now in Westminster vocabulary too, as nanny has to set her face and change the sheets for the second time in a month.As for the young masters of the ERG, they were furious about 1922 committee chairman Graham Brady’s decision to hold the confidence vote within 24 hours of the letters threshold being reached. “It is an absolute outrage,” one told the  in a typical category mistake. “Whether we end up with a change of leader, we will end up with a change of 22 chairman.” Waa waa waa, we need a new leader. Waa waa waa, we need a new chairman. Waa waa waa, we need new voters. Buck up, boys. I’m sure wildly miscast Aslan metaphor Boris Johnson will rise from the dead and save you in due course.Needless to say, those weren’t the only tears. According to various sources, even some ministers were crying during Theresa May’s pitch to the 1922 committee, when she told them she wouldn’t lead the Conservative party into the next election. She might as well have added “or lead the England side on to the pitch at the 2022 World Cup”. Still, it won’t have escaped your attention that at least one general election is likely to be already in the post, and due to arrive a lot sooner than that. May has only ruled herself out of 2022, although she apparently told the room that “in my heart”, she wanted to exorcise the 2017 demons and win then. A bit like when Stuart Pearce scored the 1990-exorcising penalty in the quarter finals of Euro 96 – except with a robotic round of heavily controlled factory visits that somehow ends up getting Theresa May a landslide. The point is: she can CHANGE.In this, as in so many other things, the alleged party of government continues to experience themselves on a bizarre time-lag. How else to explain the fact that, after the week we’ve just had, Theresa May stood in Downing Street on Wednesday morning and literally said the words: “A bright future for our country has not wavered, and it is now within our grasp.” For the rest of the day, members of the government kept popping up in the TV field hospital that’s been erected outside parliament and saying things like how the confidence vote “risks iding the Tory party”. Babes, we passed iding-the-Tory-party three towns ago. We’re on the city limits of trial-by-combat. Sorry for spoilers.As for where we go from here, many of us may find ourselves reaching the burn-it-all-down stage of a character’s journey. Perhaps both sides of the Conservative party could declare a Christmas truce, and emerge from their kill zones and trenches to play a football match on the big day? Before, obviously, returning to attempt the senseless slaughter of each other the next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a8766724e3002fa4bd8f90426103c3a738f59f4/0_162_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=053879c9600a1da239323dc670c81c1d","title":"jacob rees mogg split tory party brexit","story":"Darkness had fallen, and anyway they were caught up in the heat of the moment. It would have been all too easy for the three Tory MPs arguing on the street not to notice a middle-aged man lingering unobtrusively at a nearby bus stop.Unfortunately, it seems the former Labour MP Jim Murphy noticed them, although he says he only started paying attention after he heard one calling another a cunt. The story of a blue-on-blue row in public would sound too good to be true if it weren’t for the fact that earlier that day the rebel rent-a-quote Andrew Bridgen had stormed off camera during a live TV interview, after the deputy party chairman James Cleverly had joined him. The civil war in the Conservative party is so far out in the open that it’s pointless pretending it hasn’t started, but the more intriguing question is where it might end.Until now the focus has been on whether Brexit might drive out despairing Tory remainers, perhaps into the arms of a new centrist party. But after the foiled bid to oust Theresa May it’s perhaps more pertinent to ask what happens if the hard Brexiters will be driven to breaking point by the way this mess eventually resolves itself. Will the great Conservative rupture over Europe that has been threatened for 40 years be averted, as it has been so many times before, at the last minute? Or is David Cameron’s attempt to settle this once and for all on the verge of succeeding, if not remotely in the way he envisaged?All that the paramilitary wing of leave has achieved, by trying and failing to bring the prime minister down, is to damage everyone involved. She is bruised by a victory in which a third of her MPs expressed no confidence in her, but the paper tigers who clawed at her and missed are, if anything, even more weakened. After months of plotting, they could produce neither a credible candidate nor a credible plan when it came to it, but they want us to believe they could “manage” their way safely through a no-deal exit or renegotiate Brexit in six weeks flat. Pull the other one.Like May herself, the rebels are broken-winged rather than finished, because there are still more than enough in parliament to block any deal she produces. However, there aren’t enough of them to replace it with something they like better, either. Boris Johnson can write as many furious  columns as he likes, but evidently his colleagues aren’t convinced that he could do a better job or they would have opened the door to letting him try.Wild claims that there is a majority in the country for crashing out of the EU on a wing and a prayer, meanwhile, look rather hollow if there isn’t even a majority for it among Tory MPs. The rebellion was larger than expected, but the hard Brexiters have blown their one chance to go over their leader’s head to a more sympathetic Tory membership. Despite Jeremy Corbyn’s visible reluctance to get on the pitch, the mood is now shifting noticeably towards taking this crisis out of the Conservative party’s hands, via a second referendum, a general election, a greater say for parliament or a cross-party agreement to rule out no deal completely. And the broader the coalition trying to find a way out of this impasse, the less of a stranglehold Brexiters have over their prime minister.Asked directly about a split, Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted on Thursday morning that Tory MPs were still relatively united on everything except Brexit and could therefore come back together once it was over. But it may not be over for a decade, given the battle still to come over our longterm relationship with the EU, while leave and remain voters alike will remain trapped in the hell of their never-ending arguments.Like a couple who hate each other’s guts but stubbornly refuse to get orced, in refusing to move on, the warring factions of the Conservative party are making life intolerable for the rest of us.Where could hard Brexiters go, if they walked? There is the option of resigning the whip and sitting as independents, but that might be very short-lived. A general election next year looks increasingly likely and holding seats would be an uphill struggle for anyone lacking the backing of a party machine.Once upon a time, they could have decamped to Ukip, but its repulsive fawning over the English Defence League’s Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (aka Tommy Robinson) means that it’s now too toxic even for Nigel Farage. With his usual unerring eye for an opportunity, Farage is talking about setting up a rival Eurosceptic movement instead, which could in theory provide him with a platform and disgruntled Tory MPs with a home from which to keep the flame of their imaginary perfect Brexit alive.One reason why tempers are fraying is that none of these escape routes are ideal, which leaves everyone feeling trapped.The most obvious, and perhaps most likely, outcome is simply for hard Brexiters to do what Labour’s moderates did when they failed to unseat Jeremy Corbyn in 2016, and just grimly hang on in there, on the grounds that this is their party and they’re not budging. Yet it is in the nature of moderates to be capable of compromise and cautious about change, which is one reason they have stayed. It is rather more in the DNA of Tory Eurosceptics, as Wednesday night’s botched vote illustrated, to make impetuous grand gestures that they may later regret. Don’t bet on having seen the last of those."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eefcd76a481e29279f5631c0466525eceb8129ad/51_76_2356_1414/master/2356.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0908085c834fc469c3db49e78f07958c","title":"plan europe macron piketty green new deal britain","story":"If Brexit demonstrates that leaving the EU is not the walk in the park that Eurosceptics promised, Emmanuel Macron’s current predicament proves that blind European loyalism is, similarly, untenable. The reason is that the EU’s architecture is equally difficult to deconstruct, sustain and reform.While Britain’s political class is, rightly, in the spotlight for having made a mess of Brexit, the EU’s establishment is in a similar bind over its colossal failure to civilise the eurozone – with the rise of the xenophobic right the hideous result.Macron was the European establishment’s last hope. As a presidential candidate, he explicitly recognised that “if we don’t move forward, we are deciding the dismantling of the eurozone”, the penultimate step before dismantling of the EU itself. Never shy of offering details, Macron defined a minimalist reform agenda for saving the European project: a common bank deposit insurance scheme (to end the chronic doom loop between insolvent banks and states) a well-funded common treasury (to fund pan-European investment and unemployment benefits) and a hybrid parliament (comprising national and European members of parliament to lend democratic legitimacy to all of the above).Since his election, the French president has attempted a two-phase strategy: “Germanise” France’s labour market and national budget (essentially making it easier for employers to fire workers while ushering in additional austerity) so that, in the second phase, he might convince Angela Merkel to persuade the German political class to sign up to his minimalist eurozone reform agenda. It was a spectacular miscalculation – perhaps greater than Theresa May’s error in accepting the EU’s two-phase approach to Brexit negotiations.When Berlin gets what it wants in the first phase of any negotiation, German chancellors then prove either unwilling or incapable of conceding anything of substance in the second phase. Thus, just like May ending up with nothing tangible in the second phase (the political declaration) by which to compensate her constituents for everything she gave up in the first phase (the withdrawal agreement), so Macron saw his eurozone reform agenda evaporate once he had attempted to Germanise France’s labour and national budget. The subsequent fall from grace, at the hands of the offspring of his austerity drive – the gilets jaunes movement – was inevitable.Historians will mark Macron’s failure as a turning point in the EU, perhaps one that is more significant than Brexit: it puts an end to the French ambition for a fiscal union with Germany. We can already see the decline of this French reformist ambition in the shape of the latest manifesto for saving Europe by the economist Thomas Piketty and his supporters – published this week. Professor Piketty has been active in producing eurozone reform agendas for a number of years – an earlier manifesto was produced in 2014. It is, therefore, interesting to observe the effect of recent European developments on his proposals.In 2014, Piketty put forward three main proposals: a common eurozone budget funded by harmonised corporate taxes to be transferred to poorer countries in the form of investment, research and social spending the pooling of public debt, which would mean the likes of Germany and Holland helping Italy, Greece and others in a similar situation to bring down their debt and a hybrid parliamentary chamber. In short, something similar to Macron’s now shunned European agenda.Europe is weighed down by overgrown, quasi-insolvent banks, fiscally stressed states, irate German savers crushed by negative interest rates, and whole populations immersed in permanent depression: these are all symptoms of a decade-long financial crisis that has produced a mountain of savings sitting alongside a mountain of debts. The intention of taxing the rich and the polluters to fund innovation, migrants and the green transition is admirable. But it is insufficient to tackle Europe’s particular crisis.What Europe needs is a Green New Deal – this is what Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 – which I co-founded – and our European Spring alliance will be taking to voters in the European parliament elections next summer.The great advantage of our Green New Deal is that we are taking a leaf out of US President Franklin Roosevelt’s original New Deal in the 1930s: our idea is to create €500bn every year in the green transition across Europe, without a euro in new taxes.Here’s how it would work: the European Investment Bank (EIB) issues bonds of that value with the European Central Bank standing by, ready to purchase as many of them as necessary in the secondary markets. The EIB bonds will undoubtedly sell like hot cakes in a market desperate for a safe asset. Thus, the excess liquidity that keeps interest rates negative, crushing German pension funds, is soaked up and the Green New Deal is fully funded.Once hope in a Europe of shared, green prosperity is restored, it will be possible to have the necessary debate on new pan-European taxes on C02, the rich, big tech and so on – as well as settling the democratic constitution Europe deserves.Perhaps our Green New Deal may even create the climate for a second UK referendum, so that the people of Britain can choose to rejoin a better, fairer, greener, democratic EU.• Yanis Varoufakis is the co-founder of DiEM25 (Democracy in Europe Movement) and former Greece finance minister"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41217d2e4032b30c66222aa183d55b1a16b69be/0_228_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9b282b83fe4ceb1ea0272984e8fa5e5","title":"remain mistakes brexit leavers","story":"Theresa May has survived a vote of no confidence from her own party and is safe from a leadership challenge for at least 12 months. But for all the ERG’s theatrics on Wednesday, the entire exercise was a classic case of high-drama-low-stakes huffing and puffing. The parliamentary arithmetic remains the same: there’s no majority for May’s deal, there’s no majority for no deal.So what next? Potentially, the collapse of the natural party of government while in government, and a no-deal by default. Or, more likely, article 50 will be extended and decision-making on Brexit returned to the electorate, either through a general election (my preference), a second referendum, or indeed some combination of both. As the likelihood of Labour taking over Brexit negotiations fades, the party may well have to start war-gaming its response to a three-way choice between bad deal, no deal, or no Brexit.Arguing over institutional arrangements works for discrediting a negotiated deal in parliament. But that’s not the case when it comes to dialogue with voters. Let’s be real for a minute: normal people absolutely do not give a monkeys about the difference between “the customs union” and “the facilitated customs arrangement”. What kamikaze Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and the ERG have astutely understood from the start is that the electoral coalition that will deliver Brexit doesn’t care about the technical details. Leave does indeed mean leave. That’s why all their bluster and contradictions don’t actually matter – Caroline Lucas might “gotcha” Jacob Rees-Mogg about the fact he advocated a second referendum back in 2011, but it has remarkably little cut-through with people who don’t already agree with her.The reason Brexiteers have been so effective is that they have made the fight about broad political values. The message was sovereignty, borders, national identity bolstered by the occasional figure (£350m) or policy area (fishing). Brexit didn’t win on a manifesto, it won on emotionally resonant memes. “Take back control” was able to tell a complex story in just three words – that voters had the opportunity to reverse national decline by participating in an insurgent political moment.You can’t debunk memes with facts. It’s like bringing tap-shoes to a gunfight. So no wonder Project Fear failed in 2016. And if it is attempted again in a second referendum, it will fail again. The facts on the ground haven’t changed: telling people “it’s the economy, stupid” just sounds like you’re calling them idiots for not feeling politically invested in the finances of the rich. Arguments about collapsed economic growth aren’t going to work for people who haven’t felt the benefits of it for decades.While I think Carole Cadwalladr’s work on the financial connections between UK Brexiteers and the shady dealings of the global alt-right is incredible journalism, remainers need to stop making it their first port of call when arguing why Brexit shouldn’t go ahead. Remember that point about the difference between being right and being effective? There’s a difference between investigative diligence and frothing about referendum spending because it reinforces your own worldview that change can only be the result of cheating. Fundamentally, leave voters don’t feel that Russian networks or Facebook ads affected how they voted. And what’s more, that line risks alienating leave voters further as it makes it seem like political forces are aligning to overturn the vote on a technicality. Dark money isn’t the only thing that erodes confidence in our democracy.Remain campaigners are going to have to make arguments that operate on a radically different emotional register. Hope is important. Control over the economic and social forces that shape your existence is important. Brexiteers pulled a blinder when they monopolised “sovereignty” – but that’s not the same thing as democracy. This distinction needs to be addressed directly. You can return sovereignty to parliament, but that doesn’t mean the government won’t hold it in contempt. You might be able to fortify UK borders, detain and deport migrants more efficiently – but that won’t stop your local library being demolished to build flats you’ll never live in.For remain to win, they’re going to have to spell out (preferably in words that can fit on a bus) how they’re going to close the distance between people and decision-making institutions.The key to stopping the hard-right nationalist forces poised to pounce on Brexit isn’t going to be finessing a reprieve for the status quo. It’s about actively creating consent for meaningful change, and expanding democratic participation beyond a second referendum. In order to win, remainers need to make the case for taking back real control – and do it fast.• Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at Anglia Ruskin and the Sandberg Instituut"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a956f55e08040b7639f5d536773713bcfdc977/0_2_941_565/master/941.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c1e2d588469035ffecd375075a64be 465w","title":"uk bids to host 2020 un climate change summit","story":"Chile and Costa Rica thought to be considering alternative bids after Brazil withdrew offerBritain is bidding to host the UN climate change conference in 2020, the biggest since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015, as part of the government’s aim to be seen as a green leader.The conference will mark a vital deadline for countries to comply with their commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and move on to tougher targets for the decade to 2030, and so it is likely to be a fractious affair.If successful, the move would be a strong signal of the UK government’s determination to retain its role on the world stage after Brexit.Claire Perry, the climate change minister, flew to Poland on Thursday after taking part in the Conservative party’s vote on Theresa May’s future, which she called “24 hours of political self-indulgence”.She pointed to the UK’s efforts in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and investing in green jobs, saying Britain had decarbonised faster per unit of GDP than any other country in the past decade, and created 400,000 jobs in the low-carbon economy. “We have a really good track record in the UK,” she said.In Poland, the UK joined with other EU member states and scores of developing countries in committing to scale up their ambition on climate change, with a focus on preventing global warming from breaching 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, in line with scientific warnings.The UN awards the hosting of the COP, as the annual meeting is known, usually by alternating among developed and developing countries, and different continents, though the rules can be somewhat flexible. Next year’s host was supposed to be Brazil, but the incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, is hostile to the Paris agreement and has withdrawn the offer. Chile and Costa Rica are understood to be considering alternative bids.Some campaigners at the current climate change talks in Poland, which have stalled over continuing disagreements on how to implement the Paris agreement, praised the UK’s move.COP26, as the 2020 conference is known in UN jargon, will also be notable for the role of the US. Under Donald Trump’s presidency, the country has begun the process of withdrawal from the Paris agreement, but that could be halted if he is replaced in the 2019 election.Bolsonaro has indicated he may take Brazil out of the Paris agreement, and the isions between developed and developing countries that have characterised the current talks are likely to remain in the intervening years, giving the UK a diplomatic mountain to climb to make a success of the talks if awarded host-country status.

But big screen fatigue set in and interest started to dwindle. Now Sony is preparing to blow the Spider-Verse wide open, giving the green light to stories that barely involve or aren’t centered on Peter Parker at all – a long-overdue development.When he was first introduced, Peter was the antithesis to other superheroes he came from a low-income household and struggled with mundane things like acne, bullying, talking to girls and homework. As a boy on the brink of adulthood, his powers were both a gift and a burden, putting him at odds with law enforcement and thwarting his most meaningful relationships, and his ability to hold down a job and pay rent. Peter may have been an enhanced superhero, but his day-to-day life was relatable, almost painfully so. “After Spider-Man, everyone recognized the formula that Stan Lee figured out – quite correctly – that to make the character in costume more compelling, you have to make the alter-ego as much, if not that much more interesting,” Joe Quesada, former Marvel Comics editor-in-chief, said to ABC News. “You have to show the human side.”A character who just can’t seem to catch a break yet always does the right thing regardless proved to be a winning formula, and that coupled with a fast-moving, dynamic power set spoke to the kind of hero that audiences wanted to see. His solo run spawned an entire universe of villains, supporting characters and alternate universe Spideys. When Marvel sold the Spider-Man film rights back in 1999 to Sony, it’s reported that they took on a mind-boggling roster of 900 characters. Within the  of 12 years we saw five Spider-Man films made, each grossing over $700m globally.The first major film, 2002’s Spider-Man by Sam Raimi, tapped into all the reasons fans loved the web-slinger. Played by Tobey Maguire, Peter felt like he could’ve been any of us. He was a good-natured kid haunted by a single bad decision a high school genius who finds he’s turned into a rather mediocre adult. Seeing Peter shed his insecurities when he dons the mask was a form of wish fulfillment for many, and the films that brought him to life were relatable, funny and fun.But in what often seems to happen when art and business collide, studio interference started to shift the tone of the movies. A shoehorned-in Venom, at the studio’s insistence, led to an overstuffed Spider-Man 3 that led to an inexplicable dance number, a Peter who didn’t feel much like Peter at all and almost universally negative reviews. When Raimi and the studio couldn’t agree on one coherent vision for Spider-Man 4, Raimi stepped down. Sony moved ahead with a reboot in 2012, directed by Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield replacing Maguire as the titular hero.Webb hit virtually the same plot points as Raimi, while also going for a darker tone and a more counterculture-esque Peter. Instead of the unassuming poindexter of the early 2000s, Garfield’s Peter skateboarded and brooded. This Peter brushed up against authority even out of his costume, and in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 he is marked by a streak of selfishness: he continues to involve himself with Gwen Stacy, knowing the danger, and eventually it costs her her life. The films did well overseas, but it was hard to justify why this new rough-around-the-edges Peter was necessary. “This might be a fun summer blockbuster if only it even remotely needed to exist,” wrote Dana Stevens at Slate. Subsequent movies were canned partly due to the films falling below Sony’s expectations, but largely because Garfield ended up being “let go”.And so Sony tried again, recasting with Tom Holland and making a deal with Marvel that for the first time, Spidey would appear alongside the Avengers in 2016’s Captain America: Civil War, and then in his own spin-off film, 2017’s Homecoming. But at that point the fatigue was real. “Peter Parker may be an iconic character, but there are only so many ways you can tell an origin story,” wrote Kwama Opam at the Verge. The teen who first burst on to the scene as a breath of fresh air had suddenly become played out.It’s important then that 2017’s Homecoming did something different with the character. Instead of shuttling Peter straight into adulthood, Homecoming marinated us in the distinct secondhand embarrassment of being a teenager. The youngest to take up the mantle, Tom Holland’s Peter was affable and awkward, no matter how hard he tried to prove otherwise. But he also had a tangible support network: a younger aunt who loved him, a best friend, and a mentor in Tony Stark. And it worked, with the film garnering positive reviews and making $880m globally. It also didn’t hurt that this Peter operated, for the first time, in a New York that reflects present day he was surrounded by a multicultural cast, and Peter is hilariously aware that out of all of them, he’s probably the least cool of all.After years of focusing on Peter Parker this shifting of attention is necessary, not just from a unique storytelling perspective but from an audience engagement one as well. Since the 60s Peter has been billed as the everyman stand-in and while it’s true we can all find threads we can relate to in Peter, the ability to feel fully represented by him falls increasingly short if you’re not, well, a young white guy.And this is where newer films like Into the Spider-Verse, which tells the origin story of Afro-Latino Miles Morales turned Spider-Man, really shines. Spider-Verse takes the idea that Peter is no longer the Spider-Man of the people one step further: its version of Peter Parker is himself sick of Peter Parker. Sporting a beer gut and a five o’clock shadow, he’s a nice guy who’s self-sabotaged his own life. When Peter begrudgingly takes on the role of mentor for Miles Morales, it’s both literal and metaphorical. Peter is no longer the lead of the film what the world needs is Miles, and in order for that to happen, Peter needs to let go.Miles is in some ways similar to Peter, but he’s also everything Peter’s not he’s athletic and decently popular at school. His essays come embellished with graffiti art and his headphones play a stream of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB. With a mom who’s a nurse and a father who’s cop, he’s more well-off than Peter, but his life has the overlay of being a young black boy in America, in a city where racial profiling is a very real problem. Miles has facets to his life that a young Peter Parker would simply never be able to speak to, and that’s why centering him as the protagonist is so important. It’s not that we don’t need Peter Parker any more it’s that in 2018 we need more heroes to demonstrate to us what otherwise may have gone unseen.It seems Sony has finally, really caught up with the times, allowing it’s erse roster of characters to speak for themselves. They’ve already announced a sequel to Spider-Verse (currently the best-reviewed Spider-Man film to date), which is sure to show us Miles as he gets more comfortable in his role as NYC’s hero. An all-female spin-off is also in the works, and will probably feature Spider-Gwen (who appears alongside Miles in Spider-Verse), among others. Korean American Cindy Moon, who fights crime as Silk and deals with anger issues and unpaid internships in her day-to-day, may also star in it or head up her own spin-off film. Even Venom, which was critically panned but did exceedingly well at the box office, already has a confirmed sequel. There’s even a post-credits scene for Spider-Verse that hints at yet another erse Spidey whose lived experiences would be markedly different from Peter’s. These movies could all exist without Peter Parker never once walking into the frame, and with Holland currently thriving inside the MCU, and a countless number of stories yet to be told from these alternate universe Spideys, that’s fine.At the end of Into the Spider-Verse, Miles tells us that anyone can wear the mask. Finally, Sony seems to be realizing that too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be7c84ad07ba20185c7e2c3fca935f0a7cd5d8d4/128_86_1239_743/master/1239.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85b3471bf3b97e923a924ee271c5e680","title":"raheem sterling racism media scrutiny manchester city","story":"This week could be a eureka moment for football. Most of the reaction to Raheem Sterling’s claims that parts of the media have racially biased agendas has been very positive. It feels like a genuine step forward is being made and that Sterling has managed to turn something outrageous into a catalyst for long, overdue change.I was pleased to see him take a stance and can relate to him feeling the need to do so. It’s not his job to do it – his job is to keep performing well for Manchester City and England and to focus on his family and whatever else he enjoys. He has been targeted for abuse for years but I’ve seen interviews when he has been asked about the media scrutiny on his life and he has batted the question away like a true professional focused on his job. But clearly he reached the end of his tether and decided it was time to say something publicly, while also defending his teammates. It is significant that he has done so from a position of strength: he’s arguably one of the most successful black players in the country, riding high in the Premier League and scoring goals every week for one of the best teams in Europe. But clearly for some people that doesn’t matter. Actually, it does matter: because for some people, the better you’re doing, the more abuse you can get. Let’s think about that.One of the reasons why racism is rearing its ugly head again in football is because a lot of black players are enjoying success that is an affront to the traditional set-up of a society of white privilege. Football turns that on its head, at least in terms of players. When black men become millionaires and can buy expensive homes for their families, it infuriates people who cherish the social construct where white people are at the top and people of other ethnic backgrounds are below. Sterling, after his move to City from Liverpool, was immediately perceived as money greedy and is undeserving of his earnings. The minute he gets within earshot, some remind him of the colour of his skin because of the hatred underlying a black boy from the streets of London becoming a millionaire footballer. It is bad enough when that allegedly comes from ignorant people shouting in stadiums, but when powerful people in the media are perpetuating such stereotypes, it is even more sinister.I am sure Sterling knew what sort of hostile reaction he would get from some people. But obviously he’s mentally very tough – since he was very young he’s played in front of thousands of people in stands every week and millions on TV – and the example he gave of the different ways MailOnline treated Tosin Adarabioyo and Phil Foden was so clear and objective it was unanswerable.The heartening thing was the scale of the positive reaction. There seems to have been collective disgust and collective appraisal. There has been little beating about the bush and saying things such as: ‘Let’s have a debate about this,’ instead there has been recognition of racism – no ifs or buts. Also, usually what happens is you get Kick It Out or the same few black leaders in the media speaking out and other people become kind of desensitised, thinking: ‘OK, when something racist happens we’ll listen to them for a minute and then forget about it.’ But this time the criticism has not only been from the usual sources.I was impressed, for instance, with the way Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher spoke on Sky’s Monday Night Football. I respect Neville for admitting he did not know quite what to do when Sterling confided in him at Euro 2016 about the abuse he was getting. That has been encouraging: seeing powerful white men in football admit to failings and show a seemingly sincere willingness to assess their own thinking and actions with a view to improving. I’ve seen a lot of educating get done this week. Not to mention Neville and Carragher endorsing Sterling as a true professional with a top character, which makes the negative stories look even more absurd.That all helps because they have a lot of influence. Many of the fans watching Monday Night Football will be white men who go to matches and might be sat next to a fan who’s going to shout abuse or even be like that themselves. So when you try to change the perception of people who hold such views, you are on to something. But I would like to see more educating. I would like, for example, more club chairmen and board members be proactive and say something similar with a zero tolerance approach.Some people will refuse to learn, of course, and refuse to change. They must be called out and banned from football. No one should feel comfortable venting racist abuse, whether from the stands or through media outlets. Just as fans must call out any fans they see hurling abuse, journalists must call out colleagues who perpetuate isive rhetoric. Name and shame them.Iniduals showing solidarity and demanding certain standards are maintained can amount effective concerted action against racial bias in the media. Similar to the campaign the people of Liverpool have led against the Sun since that paper’s smearing of people around the Hillsborough disaster. Don’t read, click links or subscribe to any media organisations that peddle sinister untruths and stereotypes. This could be a solution to bring the end of the popularity of such negative narratives about black players in the press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1cf9600adae36f2c0ee5096ec277cef8e0b4b38/348_140_1952_1171/master/1952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9caab2750a7fed67c81b364e8a62fe9","title":"vidi chelsea europa league match report","story":"Olivier Giroud saved Chelsea from an embarrassing Europa League defeat at Vidi but they left Budapest counting the cost of a knee injury to Alvaro Morata.Willian’s free-kick after 30 minutes was cancelled out immediately by an Ethan Ampadu own goal and Loic Nego struck a sumptuous volley after 56 minutes to give Vidi the lead.But Giroud’s free-kick 15 minutes from time earned a draw in a match of little consequence for Chelsea, who had already qualified for the last 32 as Group L winners.

The visitors are all in black.“You left out Guendouzi in the list of teenagers on the bench,” protests Krishna Moorthi. “Not to mention Nketiah and Willock, who are starting.” Yes, I did, and that’s because those are better known than the ones I highlighted. Guendouzi, indeed, is already so famous that Manchester United players have chased after him just to grab a lock of his hair. Plenty of youngsters in that Arsenal lineup, especially on the bench. The one we’re told to be most excited about is Bukayo Saka. Word is he’s a 17-year-old from Ealing with exceptional skill and speed, a darling of a left foot and a big bright future. The teenagers on the bench include another 17-year-old, Tyrece John-Jules, plus 18-year-old centreback Zech Medley and the 19-year-old midfielder Charlie Gilmour.Hello. Here’s how things lie: Arsenal have already won Group E and Qarabag already know this is their last match in this season’s Europa League no matter what happens today. The best the visitors can aspire to is a result that restores some self-respect after their last match ended in their heaviest ever home defeat in Europe, a 6-1 clobbering by Sporting Lisbon. So this match doesn’t carry much intrigue in terms of the competition. On the other hand, the performances of certain iniduals will be worth watching: Laurent Koscileny, for instance, is set to make his return after seven months out injured 17-year-old prodigy Bukayo Saka – a thrilling forward prospect by all accounts – will make his first start and Mesut Ozil will slot back into the starting lineup and hopefully show enough ingenuity and dynamism to convince Unai Emery to give him another chance in a proper match."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05da513de7f493342e08162d1c73e013a8c2bff/0_31_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8c21d441833219a41b72333666bd198","title":"celtic v rb salzburg europa league live","story":"34 mins: On BT Sport, Chris Sutton says Celtic have so far been “outrun, outfought, outclassed”.33 mins: A delay, because Ramalho’s boot has come off and he can’t untie his laces to put it back on again.

Wolf is played through, and just about evades Simunovic’s desperate ing lunge, but as Gordon runs out he doesn’t lift the ball over him, or take the ball around him, he just slides it right into him. A fine bit of goalkeeping, but he shouldn’t have had a chance.30 mins: And that’s a lovely challenge from Ajer, who flings himself in the way to stop Minamino tapping in a cross from the right.29 mins: Celtic do an attack! They move the ball well down the right, but then the low cross goes straight to a defender.27 mins: So far Salzburg have had seven shots and five corners. Celtic are yet to have any of either.25 mins: Salzburg win another corner. This looks like it might be a long night for Celtic, though importantly Leipzig and Rosenborg are still drawing 0-0, and for as long as that’s the case Celtic are safe.24 mins: Benkovic goes down very easily as he’s touched on the shoulder by Wolf as the pair prepare to contest a cross, and the referee gives the free kick.22 mins: Another Salzburg attack, though this time the closest they come to scoring is Ulmer’s volleyed cross-shot, which looked unlikely to go in and was anyway palmed away by Gordon.22 mins: Celtic haven’t been more than 10 yards inside the Salzburg half in the last 10 minutes or so.20 mins: Celtic are taking off their captain, Lustig going off and Ajer coming on.19 mins: Onguéné is booked for taking out Edouard as Celtic try to counter.17 mins: And they so nearly score! The cross comes to the far post, the header comes in, and with the goalkeeper emphatically beaten it hits the bar, comes down six inches the right side of the line, and bounces away! Then another corner, another header, and Gordon saves well at the near post!16 mins: A smart move from Salzburg ends with Dabbur being dispossessed for a corner.14 mins: A smart-looking move by Salzburg, as they keep finding a player despite Celtic pressure, though they actually only pass the ball backwards, and eventually Mwepu tonks it into touch.11 mins: A minor festival of possession-surrender in the middle of the pitch, with Samassekou at its heart, sees the two sides win and lose the ball three times each before it finally runs out of play for a Celtic throw.11 mins: His game isn’t over, and he’s back on the pitch.10 mins: Lustig is on his feet, but it looks like his game might be over.9 mins: Salzburg had a corner, and in competing for a header it looked like Lainer planted an elbow in the back of his head, without apparent malice.8 mins: Lustig is down inside Celtic’s penalty area and there are a few players gathered around him in apparent concern.5 mins: Save! A cross from the right, and Januzovic rises 12 yards out and sends a header looping towards the far post, but Gordon tips it over at full stretch!2 mins: Nearly a chance for Celtic! Sinclair gets down the left and crosses, but it’s just too high for Forrest, who can only get the top of his head to it. “So, there’s a Buquet on the pitch and a Rose on the Salzburg bench?” notes Leo Addor. “By the way, is Marco Rose related to the mayor of Paradise City, Axl?” Enjoyable as it would be if Marco was a sweet child o’his they’re unrelated.1 min: Peeeeeep! Celtic get us started.Celtic are just huddling, and once they pop out of it we’ll be good to go.The players are in the tunnel.Rangers are out of the Europa League after losing 1-0 at Rapid Vienna.

But we get the chance to show the great confidence and belief we’ve had from virtually just after the game when we played them,” says Brendan Rodgers.So will this be a dreary encounter between a team that only needs to draw and one that doesn’t need anything? Or will it be a humdinger between a goal-friendly Salzburg side, undefeated since May and playing with no pressure, and a Celtic side forced to go for broke? Time alone will tell. Until then, hello! And here’s the league table:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b69748fa6d7c1e540a088910d0157aa1d164ed55/0_59_1769_1061/master/1769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45ed9a92e200fb59bc2ba322a990b6f5","title":"vidi v chelsea europa league live","story":"Two sublime free-kicks from Willian and Olivier Giroud helped Chelsea to a draw in Budapest, in which Alvaro Morata limped off with an injuryI’m off, thanks for reading and for your emails and tweets. A pair of excellent free-kicks did for Chelsea, who conceded an own goal while Nego scored a brilliant volley for Vidi. There will be some concern for Alvaro Morata, who limped off with a knee strain. It was the kind of awkward fall that makes you think it might be a serious injury. Let’s hope not.Stick around for the match report, plus more live Europa League action starting in 10 minutes. Cor, we do spoil you.That’s that. Chelsea win the group with 16 points, this draw and five wins. Vidi are out, finishing third behind BATE Borisov.90 min: Three minutes remaining. Both teams look satisfied with a draw. 89 min: Tensions are still running high, with the referee slightly losing control of this one. “With Mr. Ampadu looking so composed at the back, one cannot help but dream of the day when he will play alongside Luiz’s mop of hair,” emails Richard Whiddington. I can’t think of a hairier defensive pairing. Did Yedlin and Coloccini ever play together at Newcastle? 88 min: One more crucial Europa League game kicking off at 8pm. Celtic host RB Salzburg, needing a draw to secure qualification.Laurent Koscielny and Mesut Ozil are also featuring for Arsenal against Qarabag. 86 min: Vidi make their final change: Patkai comes on for Hadzic. 85 min: Fiola is quietly having a very good game for Vidi at right back. He’s kept Hudson-Odoi in check well. 84 min: Rapid Vienna have taken the lead against Rangers. Looks like that might be curtains for Steven Gerrard’s side. Follow the latest with Scott Murray.81 min: Vidi make a double change: Kovacs and Hodzic come on for Milanov (who has been Vidi’s best player) and Huszti. 79 min: This game has a slight edge to it now, as the home crowd gets riled up with a couple of tasty challenges. Loftus-Cheek gets a yellow card for a late challenge on Hadzic. Not sure that there was anything in it though. 77 min: Yellow card for Nego, who trips Loftus-Cheek. Giroud scores direct from the free-kick. This one was much better than Willian’s, right in the top corner, kissing the underside of the bar on it’s way into the net. Kovacsik didn’t move in the Vidi goal, it sailed over the wall and a Vidi defender trying to get back on the line could only watch it go over his head. 72 min: Awful foul from Vinicius, who scythes Fabregas down at the top of the D outside Vidi’s box and gets a yellow card. Barkley and Giroud both over the ball … 70 min: Chances coming thick and fast now for Chelsea, who are now dominating this game. Vidi are really struggling with crosses. First Giroud peels off at the back post and volleys over, before Pedro has time to chest down a cross, and sidefoot the ball a foot wide of Kovacsik’s left post.68 min: Big miss from Giroud, at the end of a wonderful flowing move! Loftus-Cheek, Hudson-Odoi are all involved before a beautifully weighted pass finds a buccaneering Emerson, who crosses to the near post. Giroud only needs to touch it in, but he goes with his favoured left when the right was easier. A waste! 67 min: Both Loftus-Cheek and Hudson-Odoi are playing much better on this left flank. You can tell that they have been playing for years.65 min: Giroud goes down, hard, after a momentous body check from Juhasz. That was Owen Farrell-esque. With Morata already injured, there will be some concern from the Chelsea bench. It looks like Giroud is OK.63 min: Baba Rahman is still a Chelsea player, apparently. On loan at Schalke, but has played just once since 2 September. Him and Emerson seem very weird, expensive signings.60 min: Since Pedro has come on, Hudson-Odoi has switched to the left wing, which is his natural position. Barkley finds some room outside Vidi’s box, slips Hudson-Odoi in, but the youngster’s shot is well saved by Kovaksik, who gathers at the second attempt. 58 min: He’ll remember that one, Nego, who played one match for Charlton back in 2014-2015. We have a game on our hands, even if Group L has already been decided. This is a sensational goal! Some neat play in midfield releases Milanov down the left. The Bulgarian gets his head up, delivers a perfect cross to the back post and Nego meets in on the run – he doesn’t have to break stride – volleying it first time into the top corner, beating Caballero at the near post. What a goal! 55 min: Chelsea make their second change: Pedro comes on for Willian. 53 min: Chelsea fans, do any of you like Emerson? Roma must have laughed when the £20m-ish offer came in. Wonder where Baba Rahman is these days? 50 min: Another free kick for Chelsea, this time on the right hand side of the box, so favouring the left footer. It’s Willian and Emerson over the ball … Emerson curls it into the knees of the Vidi players in the wall. Not sure he’ll be on the next free-kick.47 min: Vidi get a corner, from which Stopira has a completely free header at the back post! He heads over, miserably, from six yards out. That was Sunday league defending from Chelsea.Two bits of information to update you on. BATE Borisov are 3-0 up against PAOK, so Vidi’s hopes of finishing second are all but over. Also, Sarri smokes Merits, apparently.Half-time reading, for your consideration. A lukewarm 45 minutes. Chelsea haven’t really got out of second gear.45 min: Two minutes added on here. Giroud is on for Morata. 44 min: Chelsea playing with 10 here. Morata is still sidelined, and Giroud has been told to warm up. 43 min: Loftus-Cheek has been very poor. As has Barkley for that matter. 42 min: Morata is down, clutching his knee. He looks like in a lot of pain, although replays show the problem stems from a very innocuous landing. Still, concern for the Spaniard. 40 min: Hudson-Odoi comes alive on the right wing, causing Stopira all sorts of problems. First he plays a slide rule pass to the overlapping Zappacosta, who crosses for Morata, then the 18-year-old cuts out the middle man: tricking his way to the byline and delivering to the near post. Morata looks like he’s going to get there first but it’s a good clearance from Juhasz. 38 min: Does anybody know what brand of cigarette Sarri smokes? 35 min: A Morata shot is deflected behind, from which Willian delivers to the back post, where Christensen fouls Nego. In answer to my question about Willian not starting every game, Geoff Saunders has emailed in. “Because for all his talent and energy there is far too little genuine end point. Crosses are rarely very good, he doesn’t score enough. If I were the opposition manager I’d be happy to let him run - show him wide and watch him cross the ball into row Z.”Vidi hit straight back! A promising move down the left wins the Hungarian side a corner, from which Milanov flicks the ball on at the near post. Ampadu tries to head it clear but only succeeds in heading straight into his own net. He holds his dreadlocks in disbelief. A real shame for the Welshman, who has looked otherwise assured tonight. Willian curls the ball over the wall and into the corner. It’s a good – not great – free kick. Kovacsik, Vidi’s keeper, was probably far far over and couldn’t get there. 29 min: Willian wins what looks like a soft free-kick 25-yards out. This looks like perfect range for the Brazilian …26 min: I can confirm that Fabregas is still good at football. Will be interesting to see if that move to Milan materialises in January. He might not have the dynamism to get in Chelsea’s best XI any more, but his touch is still sublime. Remember only Ryan Giggs has more Premier League assists. 23 min: A loose pass from Hudson-Odoi is retrieved by Nikolov, and suddenly Vidi are two-on-two on goal with Chelsea’s defence. Nikolov squares the ball to Nego, who gets his feet in a muddle and can only manage a weak shot at Cabellero. 21 min: There’s been a goal in the other game in this group, and it’s a big one. BATE Borisov are 1-0 at PAOK. A win there would guarantee them second place in the group at Vidi’s expense. 19 min: Rangers have just hit the bar in their crucial game against Rapid Vienna. You can join Scott Murray right here for that one. 17 min: Yep, about right. 15 min: Chelsea fans: why isn’t Willian one of the first names of the team-sheet? He seems to be in and out of the side, despite being outrageously talented. 13 min: I went to Stamford Bridge a couple of weeks ago for Chelsea v Fulham to meet Dave Hadley, an 84-year-old Blues fan, who has been going to games since 1944. You can watch the Instagram story of our afternoon together right here. Despite his age, Dave follows Chelsea home and away – I wonder if he’s in Budapest tonight. 11 min: Good game this! Both teams showing attacking intent. Vidi will be compact but look a threat on the counter-attack, particuarly with Milanov and Nego. 9 min: Lovely ball into Milanov, who takes a delightful touch on his chest and curls a wonderful cross just a yard in front of Scepovic. It was a tap in if the Serbian got there. Emerson, who has looked woefully short of having enough quality to be a Chelsea player in the games I’ve watched, does well to clean things up at the back post.7 min: Barkley smashes a shot of goal but Vinicius, a a Brazilian-born player that became a Hungarian citizen last year, makes a heroic block and requires some treatment. 5 min: Vidi have woken up! Stopira gets forward from full back and Nikolov finds himself in a pocket of space and lets fly from 20 yards, but he slices it badly. 3 min: Not sure Vidi have touched the ball yet. Willian, Loftus-Cheek feinting and ducking around challenges on the left. Peeeeeeeeep! We’re underway in Hungary. A big night for Callum Hudson Odoi, who played very well in this competition a couple of rounds ago. A big night also for Alvaro Morata, who badly needs a goal. Vidi are second in the Hungarian league, eight points adrift of Ferencvaros. They’ve been playing European football this season since the qualifiers way back in July. They must be knackered. They do have history in this competition – a trip to the final of the Uefa Cup in 1985, beating Manchester United on the way – where they lost to Real Madrid 3-1 on aggregate. They did however beat them 1-0 at the Bernabeu. Something like that tonight would do nicely. It’s very difficult to prepare the match because we haven’t got a target. We need to have a mental target to have motivation. I am happy because we have four players who are born after 2000. It’s very misty in Budapest and that is a very strong Chelsea side. Vidi manager Marko Nikolic will have been hoping for the reserves and whilst there are 10 changes from the team that beat Manchester City (willian is the only one that ‘survives’), this is some team. Cesc Fabregas captains the side.Most notably, Ethan Ampadu starts tonight for the first time this season – he’s played more for Wales – and there’s the first involvement in a Chelsea first team for George McEachran, brother of Josh. Chelsea have conquered all before them in this season’s Europa League. Five games, five wins, 10 scored, one conceded. Chelsea are nine points clear of second-placed BATE Borisov going into Group L’s sixth final game - which is just shy of PSG’s lead in Ligue 1 after 16 matches. Not bad.All of which means that this is mother of dead rubbers for Chelsea, who should be able field some of their second stringers, current internationals, and next big things not currently playing football on a weekend. For Vidi, this is very much a crunch tie, they need to better BATE’s result away at PAOK. All to play for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3318994f724b574ee48a01cfaf4202d5f9c7b299/0_34_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b91ba024cc71993216c3ec641337fd55","title":"have you or your partner recently given birth share your experiences with us","story":"We’d like to hear about your physical and mental recovery after birthMost parents will tell you that nothing prepares you for the arrival of your first child.

They’re irrational and crazy, and there is nothing they can do about it. These are not the sentiments of Lost in Showbiz, you understand, but those of noted gender theorist Dani-not-Danny Dyer.A primer, for anyone who keeps missing important issues of Heat magazine because they are distracted by the news: Dani was a contestant on the ITV2 reality shagging competition Love Island, in which the aim of the game was to persuade the audience that you have found love in order to win a life in which you can earn your living from questionable product endorsements.But, like Katniss Everdeen in a Boohoo bikini, Dani refused to play by the rules. Instead of back-stabbing and bum-brushing her way to the prize, she found real love with Jack Fincham (a sort of human Terry’s Chocolate Orange), and the pair became IRL boyfriend and girlfriend before the show finished. She even abstained from having sex on free-to-air television, an achievement hitherto unheard of in the show’s history. Her prize for winning the Hunger Games was a life in which she barely had to work, and could live off brand partnerships – interesting, actually, how closely that resembles just playing the game.Since Love Island, Dani, and her dad, Danny-not-Dani Dyer, have had a charmed 2018. At a time when trust in almost every public figure is so low that there are websites you can go to just to read all the lies people said the day before, they have become a kind of cockney Pussy Riot. Daddy Danny gives his honest assessment on politicians, and Daughter Dani showed us a version of love that felt real. The mood of the British public towards them is best summarised by the words of Debbie Harry: “Danny, Dani: we’re so in love with you.”Post-Love Island, unlike most reality couples, Dani and Jack started to plan a serious life together. They moved into a nice flat, got a few TV-presenting gigs and were up to their eyeballs in sponsorship deals. Everything was set up: Dani’s book, What Would Dani Do? (answer: be adorable and flog some racer-back vests), is out next April, offering her the perfect launchpad to attempt what is known as the ITV triple crown: winning I’m a Celebrity, a stint on Loose Women and a job reading out tweets from viewers on This Morning. All in a single year.Then, this time last week, came that sinking feeling. The news came on Dani’s Instagram, in between 17 other posts, about the leopard-print wrap-dresses she has been doing for her new fashion line: “It’s been an incredible six months, and we will always have a place in our hearts for each other, but sadly we’ve come to the realisation that it’s not meant to be long-term.”Things escalated from there. Jack was overheard telling mates that Dani “loves publicity”, which apparently came as a shock to Dani, who posted, on her (public) Instagram account, that claims she loved attention and drama were “tiny-minded”.Love was dead, it was time to go back to being ghosted by strangers on the internet. But then Daddy Dyer appeared with the bright torch of romance.Dan Wootton of the Sun wasn’t having any of it. He plonked himself on Lorraine Kelly’s couch in a huff and called the whole thing a sham, saying they were only back together for the money. The Sun explored this further the following day. An article by Simon Boyle quoted “a source” saying “Jack and Dani’s breakup caused massive headaches for producers. They’ve filmed a number of shows together, including Love Island: The Christmas Reunion and their own reality series, and they are ruined if they don’t stay together.” Interestingly, this was almost word for word what Wootton, Boyle’s boss, said on Lorraine the previous day.We may never know whether Dan and Dani got back together for love or fame – and when your whole relationship is based on doing well in Love Island challenges where you have to masticate a banana and spew into your partner’s mouth, maybe it’s impossible to separate the two – but they were left with a problem. People liked them because they were honest … and now? Dani had gone back on her word: it was like Theresa May calling off the Brexit deal vote, or Olly Murs saying he heard gunfire. She desperately needed some kind of statesmanlike address that somehow apologised without ever acknowledging she’d been anything other than authentic.And so, after much soul-searching, she posted: “I’m just a normal nutty girl who can be a bit crazy and irrational, but what girl isn’t! People need to understand I’m still learning. I’m not living my life to please people.” I’m crazy like all women? The relationship might still be on, but the honeymoon is definitely over.In truth, Dani and Jack may have been better off wallowing in their breakup for a little longer. For decades, it has been passed down by the great PR svengalis that nothing raises your celebrity status like a high-profile relationship. But in 2018, it seems that the accessory every trending celebrity has needed is a high-profile breakup.Ariana Grande’s brief engagement to the comedian Pete Davidson was cute, but she has gained more mileage from their sudden split. Her quickly released song about the failed relationship, Thank U, Next, is the most successful track of 2018. Hip-hop power couple Cardi B and Offset, who earlier this year were on the cover of Rolling Stone, celebrating their forthcoming collaboration, a human baby, are having a similarly high-profile orce, with a slew of tracks about the breakup coming not only from Cardi, but also the model Offset allegedly cheated on her with.It would be easy, as Wootton did, to call all this a cynical way to turn emotional destitution into monetary restitution. But the truth is, this generation of celebrities doesn’t know any different. Back in the days when Brad and Jen split, the tabloids clamoured for info while all parties kept stumm. Today’s stars treat breakups just like they would a new fragrance line: stick it up on Instagram and make sure you get the marketing just right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d50ce81ce6d6666f806ad8abbf5bee0dff70acdb/0_46_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e596f095c1bf2b32a0bcfdec60d371d","title":"guardian podcast we need to talk about high street","story":" journalists, supporters and industry experts discuss the failing health of UK high streets and the impact on communities. What can local spaces offer that out-of-town shopping centres and online giants can’t?UK high streets are facing the quietest Christmas since the credit crunch, according to forecasts. A combination of low consumer confidence caused by Brexit, more agile, online competitors and shoppers increasingly opting to buy experiences instead of products are just some of the reasons cited as being responsible for the shift in spending habits. This year has been particularly bleak in Britain as well known names such as Toys R Us, Maplin, Debenhams, House of Fraser, Evans Cycles and Mothercare have been either shrunk or terminated, with 85,000 retail jobs lost in the first nine months of 2018. Beyond retail, many towns are having to fight to save their local library, pub, nursery or community centre – the places that have always fulfilled an important social function as well as a commercial one.  In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences with a panel of journalists and industry experts. This episode focuses on the demise of the high street as we know it. Supporters speak of their frustration over the lack of community, joy and productivity in their high street, as well as the loss of part-time, low-wage jobs, and why there has been so little coverage of this change and how it might affect women. Other questions we put to the panel include: What can be done to draw younger generations to town centres and indeed should we be looking at alternative high street models? What responsibility do we as iniduals have to participate in the life of our communities? Should we endeavour to reverse the onward march of convenient online consumerism?

Other British artists to be inducted are 60s psych-rock group the Zombies, glam rockers Roxy Music, gothic guitar-poppers the Cure, and Sheffield heavy metal band Def Leppard, who also won the fan ballot.Stevie Nicks and Janet Jackson were also inducted, the latter saying said she was “truly honoured” and “happy to be in there with my brothers” – the Jackson 5 were inducted in 1997, with Michael Jackson inducted again in 2001 for his solo work.Artists that were nominated but not inducted by the final vote were Kraftwerk, Devo, LL Cool J, MC5, John Prine, Rage Against the Machine, Rufus featuring Chaka Khan, and Todd Rundgren.Radiohead have been dismissive of the honour in the past, with Jonny Greenwood saying “I don’t care”, and guitarist Ed O’Brien adding: “Culturally I don’t understand it. I think it might be a quintessential American thing.” Def Leppard also once said they would “politely refuse” the honour, and even after accepting the nomination this year, frontman Joe Elliott argued that the Hall of Fame didn’t accurately reflect popular music, saying: “What elitists think is an impact is very different to what the regular man on the street counts as impact”.The induction ceremony will take place on 29 March at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/631fa4bf73c2af4b49046a81741b59c094ae77e6/8_5_3436_2062/master/3436.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a93ff68a66eaf280428a443f720ca4fb","title":"the 30 best boyband members ranked","story":"From the Osmonds’ Donny to BTS’s Jimin, boybands have produced some brilliant performers behind the hair gel. Ahead of the release of Zayn Malik’s new album, we list the greatestIs erstwhile Blue also-ran Antony Costa purely on this list because, in 2011, he took multi-tasking – a boyband staple, let’s not forget – to extremes by urinating against a cash machine while also withdrawing money and using his phone? Yes. Yes, he is.Michael Jackson’s nephew TJ, AKA one-third of temporarily successful trio 3T, wore a plaster over his bare chest, sort of near his heart, to signify pain, on the cover of their ludicrously sappy 1996 hit I Need You. That he was earnest enough to just about make it work speaks volumes.Standing out in slightly ropey late-90s R\u0026ampBpop rabble Another Level wasn’t exactly difficult, but Dane Bowers – all honeyed vocals, emotive hand gestures and chunky knit rollnecks paired with thick leather jackets – did just that.Abz (also known as Abs) fulfilled many important boyband functions in 5ive: he was the best dancer, the most vocally versatile, the shortest and, most importantly, their designated hat wearer. He now runs a chicken farm in south-west Wales.Every boyband needs a brooding outlier who doesn’t really want to be there, and Busted’s very own hair-gel-soaked rebel was Charlie Simpson, whose heavy-set eyebrows communicated more emotion than the other two members combined.According to Wikipedia, 25 men have been able to say they were once a member of Scotland’s answer to the Beatles, the Bay City Rollers. It was Les McKeown, however, who sang their biggest hits during the peak of their mid-70s hysteria, pulling off some ludicrous, often awkwardly cropped, tartan-themed outfits while maintaining a down-to-earth brio.Hanson were the anti-boyband when they emerged in 1997, all unkempt (yet probably expertly conditioned) blonde hair, slacker outfits and, you know, real instruments. But in middle brother Taylor, they had a ruddy-cheeked, beaded necklace-wearing, keyboard-hammering teen heartthrob.There’s a lot to dislike about Gary Barlow vis-a-vis his boyband years. For one, he couldn’t dance. Two, he epitomised the antithesis of a good boyband member, ie he was the Sensible One, a role taken up by Liam Payne in One Direction. Three, he had zero stage presence. But, on the other hand, he wrote Back for Good, so he’s on the list.An original teen heart-throb, Donny Osmond was able to balance being the star of the Osmonds with a burgeoning solo career. Mind you, he almost lost both when, at the age of 13, his voice broke and he could no longer do justice to the band’s bubblegum ballads, leading to the more “experimental” Crazy Horses album in 1972.East 17’s chief songwriter was so untouchable during their early 90s peak that even when he sported two dangly plaits at the front of his otherwise cropped hair in the video for It’s Alright, no one seemed to say anything. Stay Another Day, which he wrote about his brother’s suicide, remains one of the UK’s best Christmas No 1s.On YouTube, there’s a handful of fan-edited videos showcasing Blue lynchpin Lee Ryan’s not inconsiderable vocal range, from Breathe Easy’s showboating to some gloriously OTT ad-libs. What it doesn’t show, however, is the interview he did in 2001 where he criticised the reaction to the 911 terrorist attacks and instead fretted about the plight of elephants, whales and dolphins.The fulcrum across which Take That’s more showy members , Orange, alongside the less mysterious Howard Donald, chiefly took care of the dancing side of the boyband’s output. While Robbie wore his heart on his sleeve, the enigmatic Orange gave nothing away, even refusing to confirm or deny a long-rumoured affair with Relight My Fire collaborator Lulu.In many ways, the Monkees – who were created specifically for a TV show and had limited input into their early material – laid the template for the manufactured boyband as we know it. In fact, the lead singer, Manchester-born Davy Jones, also set the template for the perpetually clean-shaven, cute-as-a-button, bring-home-to-mum heart-throb, paving the way for Take That’s Mark Owen.At BTS’s recent London arena shows, it was 23-year-old hair-dye enthusiast Jimin who, in the middle of all the robotic choreography, brought the flashes of old school boyband sex appeal, “accidentally” showing off his abs during the gorgeous, slow-burn solo track Serendipity.Google “90s curtains hairstyle” and chances are you will get myriad pictures of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, whose blond tresses and ability to look good in all-white thin cotton made him the default boyband caricature for years to come.With his crooked teeth and gangly physique, New Edition’s Ralph Tresvant wasn’t the obvious choice for band frontman, not least when you consider he was up against Bobby Brown. But, on songs such as Cool It Now, he mixes obvious enthusiasm (a crucial and often ignored boyband attribute) with his unique, stop-you-in-your-tracks vocal.For sheer determination alone, perennially cherubic Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell deserves a place on this list. Born with a heart murmur, he underwent surgery in 1998, before contracting swine flu in 2009 and, two years later, announcing his golden voice was being slowly depleted by dysphonia. Boyband is life, though, so obviously he is still going.Latino boyband institution Menudo, which ran for 22 years and utilised a constantly evolving lineup, had no time for imperfections. In fact, Ricky Martin was initially declined twice for being too short. Thankfully, it was third time lucky and the boyband boot camp set him on his way to hip-swivelling, perma-smiling, loca livin’ solo stardom.In any other boyband, all-rounder JC Chasez would have been the main attraction. In ’NSync, however, he played second fiddle to fellow Mouseketeer Justin Timberlake, sharing vocal duties (his was the more soulful of the two) while keeping pace with the band’s often ludicrous dance routines.In many ways, Big Bang’s G-Dragon, hailed by many as the king of K-pop, ushered in the era of the modern, multi-disciplinary Korean pop star. A singer-songwriter, rapper, producer, entrepreneur and fashion icon (he once appeared on the cover of Italian Vogue), G-Dragon brought an alluring androgyny and edge to the band. He is currently halfway through his mandatory military service.When he wasn’t flagrantly boasting about class-A drugs or accidentally running himself over after eating too many jacket potatoes, the beanie-hatted Brian Harvey was one of UK pop music’s best vocalists, smoothing out the jagged It’s Alright and acting the angel on the lovely Stay Another Day.Formed by producer Maurice Starr after he was fired by New Edition, New Kids on the Block carried an ace up their sleeve in the shape of Jordan Knight, who married a glorious falsetto with a penchant for waistcoats and a back-combed 80s fringe.After a troubled upbringing marked by poverty, Gately seemed to have found his calling as one fifth of Boyzone, imbuing their litany of covers with true emotion. The video for Better, one of their final singles before his sudden death in 2009, featured Gately embracing his husband, further breaking down barriers following his public coming out a decade earlier.The leader of the self-proclaimed “best boyband since One Direction”, AKA the genre-bending Brockhampton, Kevin Abstract represents the future for boybands. As a queer black man unafraid to share his emotions publicly, be it in his music or via social media, he has also become a spokesperson for a generation.Before the head tattoos, the graffiti obsession and the faint whiff of Howard Hughes, there was that feathery voice, lending even the most trite lyric a wounded soulfulness. Even his chosen performance style – an interesting mix of bored and confused – came across as enigmatic and brooding during the early years.Earnestness gets you a long way in an American boyband. No one knows that better than Backstreet Boys’ heavily tattooed rebel AJ McLean, who delivers each of his lines – from I Want It That Way’s closing declaration to the excellent pre-chorus on 2018’s Chances – as if his life depends on it.Dimples, hair, tabloid controversy (the rumoured relationships his sexuality that time he whispered into Matt Cardle’s ear about, erm, cats), unique style, tattoos and talent ... Harry Styles was a perfect storm, and often the only reason to see One Direction play live.There was something a bit head boy about Justin Timberlake in ’NSync he could sing, dance and rock a tight perm, all seemingly without breaking a sweat. Mind you, that false projection of effortlessness is part of what makes a great popstar, and JT made it look very easy indeed.Boyband members often fulfil specific roles be it heart-throb, rebel, clown or mouthpiece. In Robbie Williams, Take That got all of those things at once. Equal parts cheeky chappy, sex god and wounded victim, Williams was never going to be contained in the confines of a band, but it was glorious while it lasted.Introduced to the world via the distinctly adult themes of I Want You Back, the then 11-year-old Michael Jackson imbued the song with a terrifying primal urgency. Having studied the Motown greats since the age of seven, Jackson was able to put his revision into practise, and he didn’t waste a moment, gliding his way across a litany of genre agnostic hits as part of the Jackson 5 and, later, the Jacksons. Adolescence may have destroyed him, but there’s something uniquely magical about seeing a true one of a kind hitting the ground running."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55dc84b48d198f0fbda9146ebd0bee1129ce0085/0_0_4412_3033/master/4412.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=912b8b6c1d040a6118af9b3160b6d024 1760w","title":"despairing businesses triggering no deal brexit plans says cbi","story":"Industry body says firms have already sent hundreds of millions of pounds out of UKBusinesses are in “despair” over Brexit and have already erted hundreds of millions of pounds in investment out of the UK, the Confederation of British Industry has said.The CBI deputy director general Josh Hardie said companies around the country, who did not seek publicity, had already pressed the button on contingency plans for no deal.“What has happened this week is that contingency plans have now been triggered,” he said.Businesses have been watching the political meltdown and have little faith clarity is around the corner after this week’s Westminster chaos, the CBI believes.“I know of one food processing company who has been waiting for planning permission for five years. It has just got the permission but has has decided now not to go ahead because of the threat of no deal. This would have been a major investment and hundreds of jobs,” said Hardie.“Some of these decisions are reversible, but the worrying thing is that a huge number of companies are just making the investment elsewhere. They cannot wait.“The idea that there is a massive wall of money being saved up for April when we know what is going to happen, is just wrong. It has already gone elsewhere.“We are talking hundreds of millions of pounds. We are talking tens of millions for some inidual companies.”The CBI director general, Carolyn Fairbairn, described Wednesday night’s vote on Theresa May’s leadership as a “chaotic detour” that showed a complete disconnect between the Westminster bubble and business.“Uncertainty is throttling firms and threatening jobs – not in the future but right now,” she said.She said businesses were “counting on politicians”.The CBI’s concerns were echoed by the Institute of Directors which said business leaders were “tearing their hair out” at the current state of negotiations.“The last thing businesses needed today was even more uncertainty – and yet politics has managed to deliver on that once again,” said Stephen Martin, its director general.The British Chambers of Commerce called on politicians to “redouble efforts” to stop a no-deal Brexit happening. “There is not time to waste,” said their director general, Adam Marshall.Hardie said manufacturing businesses were among the first to be hit as they were being forced into contingency plans now involving stockpiling and warehousing.Car companies were also being hit with just-in-time production systems forcing them to seek extra parking facilities in the event that lorries loaded with components could be stored.Last week a senior executive from Toyota told a select committee that the company had no warehousing facilities such was its reliance on the just-in-time production process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fd1cd272e51874d14567b643570e1c68a51e04/0_46_1449_869/master/1449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27f8294d8b12dc9d60c9cb52c623a5cb","title":"what is the eu backstop offer and why wont it sway brexiters","story":"MPs demand a time limit to the backstop, raising the bar for Theresa May in BrusselsTheresa May, shortly after seeing off the rebels seeking to dethrone her, took to the steps of Downing Street to tell of her intention to secure “legal and political assurances” on the backstop in the withdrawal agreement to “assuage the concerns that members of parliament have on that issue”.By threatening to keep the UK in a customs union, the Northern Ireland backstop for avoiding a hard border in effect torpedoes Brexiters’ dream of a “global Britain” able to strike trade deals around the world, and set its own regulatory path, free from Europe. With Northern Ireland also due to stay in the single market, the Democratic Unionist party says it amounts to breaking up the United Kingdom.Of the 117 Tory MPs who voted against the prime minister, there will be a fair few who will only be sated by the backstop being ripped out from the withdrawal agreement, the line taken by the DUP. There is no hope of this coming to pass, and the prime minister knows it.Others, including many MPs who did not vote in favour of ousting May, grudgingly accept that the backstop must remain, but have one central demand: they want a ready exit mechanism, or time-limit, to convince them that the UK will not be trapped in it.The first step in the EU’s response has been to offer some warm, but ultimately weak, words of reassurance. The leaders reiterated that “the backstop does not represent a desirable outcome” for the bloc, and that they would seek to find an alternative arrangement before the end of the transition period to avoid it being implemented. In any case it would be temporary should it come into force, and Brussels would negotiate and “conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop”.Then they offered a tantalising glimpse of their potential second step, and of the debate that is now raging among the EU27 member states. “The union stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided,” the leaders said. “Such assurance will not change or contradict the withdrawal agreement.”May is seeking to attach a “joint interpretative instrument” to the withdrawal agreement, which would extrapolate from the commitments to make “best endeavours” to get out of the backstop that already exist. Such a device was used in 2016 to reassure the Belgian region of Wallonia when it was holding back on the ratification of the EU-Canada trade agreement.A crucial insight into what Downing Street may want to include in that legal document, although much is in flux, lies in an amendment put forward to the “meaningful vote” by the Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire. The government’s fingerprints were certainly all over it.Swire proposed to place “a duty” on the government to make all efforts to get out of the backstop within one year of it coming into force. An idea certainly floated in Whitehall is for this sort of duty to put on Brussels too. But it will be a tough sell.While the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, expressed his hopes of offering such “legal and political assurances” at the summit on Thursday and Germany is in favour, others including the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the Finnish prime minister, Juha Sipilä, spoke of difficulties in even considering a legal interpretation to go with the treaty. Spain is highly sceptical. And Belgium has privately warned that the Brexiters will just come back for more, describing it as “a carousel”.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who has emerged as the pantomime villain in these Brexit talks is said to be firmly opposed. Meanwhile, the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, admitted that during his “long meeting” with May in the margins of the summit, there had not been a complete meeting of minds. “Some of the suggestions she made, made sense, others I thought were difficult”.The EU and the British government agree that they will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, for fear of the whole thing unravelling. By providing legal interpretations, Macron and others fear that they are tinkering with the backstop via the backdoor.But more significantly, the prime minister’s brush with the political dustbin on Wednesday night has also upped the level of scepticism about such legal tinkering making an impact on May’s chances of getting her deal through parliament. “Some sceptics are not really using rational arguments”, the baffled Austrian chancellor remarked. The EU’s leaders want to help – but will it really make any difference?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ae89de39e204dd86b72eecbd6fc821077f15ed3/0_33_2713_1628/master/2713.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e9c29caff2830b86fe3d3650b0a4c9e","title":"theresa may heads to brexit talks in brussels after seeing off vote politics live","story":"PM won party backing in confidence vote but faces uphill battle to get her deal through CommonsWe’re closing down this live blog now. See 5.26pm for a comprehensive summary of the day’s events. And you can read our main story here:And this is an interesting take from Gary Younge:There is no other credible fall-back solution to replace the backstop that would allay Irish fears of seeing a “corrosive” hard border on the island of Ireland, the country’s foreign affairs minister has said.Simon Coveney has told an Irish parliamentary committee that, even though the country’s government did not want to use the insurance mechanism contained in the draft withdrawal agreement, it had to be included.His comments come as Theresa May seeks a form of backstop agreement she can sell to a sceptical UK Parliament. She was previously understood to be looking merely for a promise from the EU that it would not become a permanent arrangement shoutld it be used. But the prime minister has been left in little doubt in recent days that anything short of a legally binding control on the backstop will be difficult to push through when MPs vote.We are all committed to ensuring that the backstop never takes effect and should it take effect, we are committed to trying to ensure that it is only temporary so that it can be replaced with something more permanent.But, for the moment in my view, there is not another credible fall-back solution that can take the place of the backstop and that is why EU leaders have been so clear and why the British prime minister has been so clear that there is a need for the backstop, even though we want to avoid using it.The backstop is about preventing the threat to the normality and stability and peaceful relations that have built up over the last two decades on the island of Ireland and ensuring that we don’t have the corrosive impact in the future of enforced border infrastructure between the two jurisdictions,” he said.Coveney also said the Irish government was continuing to prepare “for all eventualities”, including a no-deal Brexit.But the UK’s defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, has said such a Brexit represents a threat to the UK’s security.It is clear there will be no changes to the deal the prime minister brought back last month. Theresa May herself says she isn’t expecting a breakthrough.There must be no more dither and delay, or attempts to run down the clock in an attempt to deny parliament alternative options.People and businesses need certainty. The prime minister should put her deal before parliament next week in our country’s interest.She has admitted her deal is likely to be defeated by a significant margin. There is no time to waste, and parliament must take back control.Brexit will happen at the end of March. I am working on the basis that May will try to bring the deal to a vote in the House of Commons in January. I very much hope that the British MPs will become aware over the Christmas holidays that they will not be doing their constituents a favour if they allow it to end in a no-deal Brexit.At some point the day of truth will come. The vote has already been pushed back but it must happen before the end of March. The plan is that it will take place in January. Then we will see if there is a majority. If there is no majority in the Commons, that would lead to a chaotic situation. Forces could be unleashed in all directions - from a second referendum, which I believe unlikely, to a repeat vote in the Commons or a no-deal Brexit.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.A colleague will be taking over now, to cover further developments from the EU summit.Nigel Lawson, the Conservative former chancellor, is a hardline Brexiter. But even by their standards, what he says about Theresa May in a Prospect interview is unusually harsh. He says:I would have obviously voted against her, because she has been a disaster in every way. The deal which she has come back with is the worst deal imaginable.There was nothing to be said for May’s deal, he told Prospect. It would “commit the UK to being a dependency of the European Union, and indefinitely.”Jose Manuel Barroso, the former president of the European commission, is urging the EU to show a bit more flexibility towards the EU on the backstop issue. Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, seems to be on a mission to alienate Westminster political journalists. He has sent out a press release urging the government to cancel the Christmas parliamentary recess until there has been a vote on the Brexit deal. He explains:At a time of so much uncertainty caused by this Brexit mess, it is an insult to the British people that Theresa May is happy for MPs to go on holiday without voting on the biggest issue in generations. People deserve better, and the Liberal Democrats demand better.Liberal Democrats do not believe parliament should rise for the Christmas recess until Theresa May does what the people expect and give MPs a vote on her deal. Now more than ever MPs should be working to help their constituents, not least by giving them a final say on Brexit with the option to remain in the EU.(Some of us are looking forward to recess ....)Downing Street has now said the Commons vote on the Brexit deal will definitely not happen until after Christmas. At the afternoon lobby briefing, the prime minister’s spokeswoman said:The ‘meaningful vote’ will not be brought to parliament before Christmas.The spokeswoman also said the vote will come “as soon as possible in January”. The government has committed to holding it before January 21.And this is what Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said earlier after his meeting with Theresa May.It was a very good meeting, it was an opportunity for all of us to put forward ideas that might work, things that might be considered. It really wouldn’t be helpful to go into that sort of detail.I don’t think we could agree to anything that would change the content to the treaty, the content to the withdrawal agreement. What we can say is the backstop is not on the table. It needs to be there for a reason.Over in Greece where memories are still fresh of the debt-stricken country’s own cliffhanger talks with the EU, the media are watching today’s events with a sense of déjà vu.“May heads to Brussels with few hopes,” proclaimed the left-leaning Syntaktwn newspaper describing her survival of the confidence vote as a pyrrhic victory given the British PM had lost the support of a third of her MPs. In a column recalling Athens’ own clashes with the EU as it struggled to avoid crashing out of the eurozone, Alexis Papachelas, chief columnist of the conservative daily Kathimerini, bemoaned Britain’s descent into chaos, saying in many ways it resembled the “huge mistakes” Greece had made at the height of its debt crisis. He explained:We Greeks are watching the unfolding of a situation which is somewhat paradoxical … we have seen how a country can enter a precarious phase when its establishment flounders and makes huge mistakes.The difference between Greece and Britain? Basically, it is that we, as southern Europeans, are good at political acrobatics. He was referring to how Greece’s leftist prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, accepted the excoriating terms of a third bailout with the EU in 2015 – only weeks after the Greeks voted in a referendum rejecting this option. Tsipras blatantly disregarded the referendum result, but Greece avoided Grexit. The British are making all the mistakes we made in Greece, but they lack our flexibility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa309bb48095687445744a6dcd528e101ac46adf/69_0_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70118663ddea5871e6a8caa3d441de9c","title":"china demands developed countries pay their debts on climate change","story":"Key sticking point at UN negotiations is how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissionsChina called on rich countries to “pay their debts” on climate change at global talks on Thursday, criticising developed countries for not doing enough to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide finance to help poor countries do the same.The trenchant intervention by Xie Zhenhua, the minister who leads the Chinese delegation and a veteran of the UN climate negotiations, came as China faced increasing pressure to shift its stance on some of the key rules required to implement the 2015 Paris agreement.By contrast, he said, developing countries had been “very flexible and constructive” at the talks. One of the key sticking points at the UN negotiations in Poland is over how countries should account for their greenhouse gas emissions, and how their progress in meeting their commitments on curbing carbon should be measured and verified.Developed countries prefer strict standards but developing countries have historically been allowed some leeway, in recognition that their governance structures and capabilities may lag behind.But the EU and other developed countries are concerned that large rapidly developing economies such as China are not agreeing to adequate transparency in accounting for their emissions.Xie said the talks were “deadlocked”, but maintained that China should continue to be treated as a developing country, and that developing countries should have flexibility over transparency rules.Claire Perry, the UK’s climate minister, who arrived on Thursday after the Tory party’s dramatic vote of confidence in Theresa May on Wednesday night, said she was making transparency a key focus of her efforts at the talks.If no compromise can be reached, the talks may end this weekend without finalising the rulebook for implementing the Paris agreement, which was the key aim of these two weeks of negotiations.Developed countries also came under heavy fire in other parts of the conference. A coalition representing scores of the poorest and most vulnerable nations called on them to raise their emissions-cutting targets, and separately the Pacific island states – acutely vulnerable to climate change –\u0026nbspcalled for the world to abandon coal power generation.“We call on all OECD countries to quickly phase out their use of coal by 2030 and for all other countries to phase out their use of coal by 2040,” Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, the president of COP23, said. “There must be no expansion of existing coal mines or the creation of new mines.”Pacific Rim powers Australia and the US have both this week said publicly they have no plans to begin phasing out coal-generated power. By contrast, Perry said the UK would have no unabated coal-fired power stations by 2025.“The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,” President Donald Trump’s international energy and climate adviser, Wells Griffith, told a US government-run panel discussion on fossil fuels.Australia’s ambassador for the environment, Patrick Suckling, added: “Fossil fuels are projected to be a major source of energy for a significant time to come.”Cook Islands prime minister Henry Puna told the  the phase-out of coal was critical to the survival of Pacific island states. “We have made that call, it is not directed at any one country, but it applies to all. We know that coal power plants are a significant cause of the climate change we see affecting the whole world.”The Pacific island states also called for the establishment of an international protection regime to protect people displaced by climate change.Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Males and now leading the country’s negotiating delegation, said “four countries” – referring to the US, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia, the bloc resisting welcoming the IPCC’s 1.5C special report – were deliberately frustrating negotiations.“Nothing’s happening. Absolutely nothing is happening,” he said. “You have this whole dictionary of words that has been brought into these climate conferences, then they talk about brackets, and we go round and round and round, and we don’t go anywhere.”While at the political level, oil-producing and large emitting nations have resisted increasingly strident calls from several country blocs to announce new targets for deeper emissions cuts, inside the negotiating rooms, officials from countries such as the US and Australia are reported to be working constructively to progress discussions on a Paris agreement rulebook.“Countries are negotiating in good faith, some in better faith than others, but there is progress,” Costa Rica’s minister for the environment and energy, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/930c479db4f1ac9b6d7a9b1d37c12497a640cbb9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f7ca4db1329e0648243b1b04c667a79","title":"virgin galactic spaceshiptwo launch california edge of space","story":"Spacecraft launched on Thursday in test mission became first commercial US flight beyond the atmosphere since 2011A Virgin Galactic rocket plane blasted to the edge of space on Thursday, capping off years of difficult testing to become the first US commercial human flight to reach space since America’s shuttle program ended in 2011.The test flight foreshadows a civilian space race that could kick off as soon as next year, with the British billionaire Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic battling other billionaire-backed ventures to be the first to offer suborbital flights to tourists who pony up the hefty fares.Virgin’s airplane-like SpaceShipTwo took off on Thursday morning from California’s Mojave air and space port, about 90 miles (145km) north of Los Angeles.Richard Branson, wearing a leather bomber jacket with a fur collar, attended the takeoff along with hundreds of spectators on a crisp morning in the California desert.After the rocket plane topped 50-mile altitude – reaching what some agencies consider the edge of space – a crying Branson high-fived and hugged spectators.“Take off! WhiteKnightTwo and SpaceShipTwo have taken to the skies,” Branson said on Twitter.The high-altitude launch comes four years after the original SpaceShipTwo crashed during a test flight that killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot, dealing a major setback to Virgin Galactic, a US offshoot of the London-based Virgin Group.“We’ve had our challenges, and to finally get to the point where we are at least within range of space altitude is a major deal for our team,” George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic’s chief executive, told reporters during a facilities tour on Wednesday in Mojave, where workers could be seen making pre-flight inspections of the rocket plane.While critics point to Branson’s unfulfilled space promises over the past decade, the maverick businessman told a TV interviewer in October that Virgin’s first commercial space trip with him onboard would happen “in months and not years”.Thursday’s test flight had two pilots onboard, four Nasa research payloads and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.The flight landed safely back on Earth just over an hour after it took off. Virgin Galactic said it reached a height of 51.4 miles, and traveled at 2.9 times the speed of sound.More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin’s suborbital flights, including the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Also vying for the space tourist market are ventures such as the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk’s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen’s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said the Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa would be the company’s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000ft by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles above Earth, high enough for passengers to see the curvature of the planet.The 50-mile mark is high enough to earn astronaut wings from the air force and the Federal Aviation Administration, though other agencies define space as beginning at 62 miles above Earth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f966f0d953bdfc48713bbba6fe6fec4143a57909/0_292_5136_3081/master/5136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=854b8e8e79e41b413624d82259e2c6bc","title":"ashley giles set to be named as england new director of cricket","story":"Ashley Giles is set to be named the new director of England cricket. The former left-arm spinner is understood to have been offered the role and is now in the final stages of negotiations over terms.The appointment, which should be confirmed in the coming days, will bring to an end a two-month search for a successor to Andrew Strauss, who stepped down in October after three years in the role as his wife, Ruth, undergoes treatment for cancer.Giles, the sporting director at Warwickshire, has emerged from the second round of interviews this week as the preferred candidate and his tenure is now expected to begin when the Test side tours the Caribbean in January. Strauss, who will continue to work for the ECB on an ad hoc consultancy basis, was on the interview panel.It marks a comeback of sorts for the 45-year-old, albeit in higher position, after he was stood down as one-day coach at the end of the torrid 2013-14 winter. That move was prompted chiefly by the 5-0 Ashes whitewash inflicted on the Test team and a desire by Paul Downton, Strauss’s predecessor, to unify the head coach position.Andy Flower, who was the Test team director at the time, has worked for the England and Wales Cricket Board ever since – most recently as a stand-in for Strauss while he took time out from the position – and it now remains to be seen whether a role remains for the Zimbabwean when Giles is appointed.The England role has been set up well by Strauss – not least when looking ahead to next summer’s World Cup and home Ashes campaign. Joe Root’s Test side has recently risen to No 2 in the world, while the No 1-ranked one-day team, led by Eoin Morgan, will head into the 50-over tournament as favourites following three trailblazing years.Giles will be required to appoint a new head coach in his first year in the the job, with Trevor Bayliss having already confirmed he will not be seeking a contract extension beyond the end of the 2019 home season. Paul Farbrace, his assistant, is also expected to step down at the same time.Giles will oversee the entire men’s pathway – from the Loughborough academy and the Lions through to the national teams – and despite the ECB securing a £1.1bn broadcast deal from 2020-23, he will need to manage a reduced budget as funds are directed towards the creation of the controversial new 100-ball tournament.As well as knowing the demands of international cricket from a career that brought 143 Test wickets from 54 caps between 1998 and 2006 – as well as 62 one-day international appearances – Giles has not rested on his reputation, having furthered his off-field experience by studying for a Masters in sports directorship at Manchester Met University.With Surrey’s title-winning director of cricket, Alec Stewart, not applying for the role and Leicestershire’s chief executive, Wasim Khan, recruited by Pakistan in recent weeks, Giles became the obvious candidate given a wealth of relevant experience both at county level and as a former England selector.The latter coincided with the back end of his first spell in charge of Warwickshire – a five-year tenure that brought with it the 2012 County Championship title. He then stepped up as England’s one-day coach for an 18-month period in which the team reached the 2013 Champions Trophy final, before returning to county cricket at Lancashire where further domestic success followed.Securing promotion and the T20 Blast title for the Red Rose in 2015 – his first season in charge – he returned to Warwickshire two years later when, amid a desire to return to the Midlands for family reasons, the club bought him out of his contract at Old Trafford.He will doubtless leave Edgbaston for the second time with a heavy heart and a sense of unfinished business. An ageing side was relegated from Division One in 2017 before bouncing back at the first attempt, with Giles midway through an overhaul of the first-team squad at the club where he spent his entire 13-year playing career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ff6fc1de72fbe55967c5503ee41abb2d8c7442/0_48_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f62f4b1973ee2554c287155f05850313","title":"yokozuna controversies and a dump truck a sumo history in pictures","story":"The origins of sumo date back 2,000 years and it was from the 17th century that saw its rise as a spectator sport.

The parody accounts, @Wetherspoon__UK and @SpoonsTom, have tens of thousands of followers each on the social network, and tweet a mixture of fake updates about Wetherspoon’s pubs and replies to users who mistakenly believe they are contacting the real company.One particular tweet, sent in late October, claimed that Wetherspoon’s pubs would be boycotting the national poppy appeal “due to the ever expanding multiculturalism of our clientele”.JD Wetherspoon’s barrister David Hirst said that tweet led to a man attending the company’s annual general meeting (AGM) and asking “very heated questions”.The accounts, first created in July 2014, have been run anonymously since that date, although the operator identifies as “Tom” in postings. Hirst said the situation had been made worse by the fact that JD Wetherspoon had taken down its official Twitter account in April.The high court’s Master McCloud laughed as she read a tweet posted on 11 July, the morning of England’s World Cup match with Croatia: Hirst also referred to a tweet posted two days earlier, which said: “When England reach the World Cup Final, we’re gonna close all our pubs in England early at 3pm on Sunday 15th July. We want our colleagues to be the 12th man cheering on the lads.” The tweet was mimicking a genuine promise made by the supermarket chain Aldi.He said that “did not come to pass because Croatia got in the way … but had it come to pass, what could have been the biggest beer day in English history would have possibly not been for the chain.”Hirst said JD Wetherspoon did not know who was behind the accounts, but that “one working assumption for this is that it is an ex-employee”.He said that “Twitter, to their credit, have recognised on each occasion that we have brought it to their attention that it is a breach of their terms”, but he pointed out that it has “carried on for four years”.The court also heard that a crowdfunding page had been set up to “fund Tom’s legal costs when Spoons finally lose the rag and set their legal team on me”, which has raised £125.

Metal hooks, once used to cure hunks of mortadella from the rafters, still decorate the ceiling and the umami-heady funk of aged Parmigiano-Reggiano perfumes the shop. Since opening in 1932, in Bologna’s Quadrilatero, a labyrinth of medieval streets, the store stocks some of the best charcuterie in town. When owner Giovanni Tamburini isn’t rubbing elbows with local politicians over plates of superlative tortellini, he plays in a rock band named Ciccioli Ciccioli, which means “pork cracklings” in local dialect. During the month leading up to Christmas, Bolognesi come here to stock up on bottles of bubbles and baskets of gourmet goodies.• Via Caprarie 1, tamburiniDiana HubbellThe Rialto neighbourhood remains integral to the city’s resilient local population and, on Christmas Eve morning, Venetian families arrive to peruse the stalls of the fish, fruit and vegetable markets to do their shopping for the traditional vigilia dinner that evening. The one store everyone stops off at is Antica Drogheria Mascari. Close to the Rialto Bridge, on the Calle degli Spezieri (street of the spice merchants), where exotic riches from across the world have been traded for 700 years, Mascari is more than just a spice emporium. Every inch is packed with goodies: rare balsamic vinegar, truffles and dried mushrooms, colourful spices, herbs and teas, preserved fruits, chunks of hazelnut-stuffed chocolate. The Mascari family opened the store in 1948 and Mamma Sonia is still behind the counter, assisted by her sons Gabriele and Gino, who have extended the store with a cantina, showcasing a stellar collection of Italian wines. Christmas specialities? Choose between the classic panettone (€13.90) from Milan or traditional buranelli sweet, hard biscuits – baked on the lagoon island of Burano and traditionally dipped in sweet vin santo (€2.90).• Calle degli Spezieri 381, San Polo, imascariJohn BruntonOne of Porto’s old-style grocery stores (mercearias), Comer e Chorar por Mais has been filling larders with traditional Portuguese produce since 1912. Floor-to-ceiling shelves of port line the walls but it’s the foodstuffs in this family-owned store that will have you “crying for more” (chorar por mais). No festive table in Porto is complete without a spherical slab of amanteigado (€23.50 per kilo), a soft cheese eaten with lemony sponge cake. Dried and crystallised fruits mark another must-buy, with pumpkin (€11.95 per kilo) among the more unusual flavours. Carnivores shouldn’t leave without a fat slice of pig’s neck (€24.50 per kilo), which is marinated in wine, garlic and laurel, before undergoing a serious smoking. And Porto’s iconic Bolhão market is on the doorstep, though it is currently under renovation.• Rua Formosa 300, comerechorarpormaisOliver BalchFounded in 1919, this family-run business is packed with history, tradition and atmosphere – as well as sausage, wine and cheese. The focus is on artisan-produced, high-quality local products – and the Aragon region, of which Zaragoza is the capital, offers rich pickings. Shop for chorizos, a wonky wheel of Tronchón goat and ewes milk cheese, truffles from Teruel, jars of foie and pate and curious stews (quail and pochas beans, perhaps?) and beautifully packaged fancy sweet stuff (the chocolate-covered glacé fruit indulgence Frutas de Aragón is a must). All Spain stocks up on the hoofed legs of jamón hanging over the counter, and boxes of nougatty turrón in the run-up to Christmas – try the Turrón al cava Puyet, or the nutty Aragón variation guirlache. A vast bodega stocks unusual wines from far and wide but the selection of wines from the four local D.O.s is unparalleled: Campo de Borja, Calatayud and Carinena – all renowned for garnachagrenache – and mountainous Somontano, famed for chardonnay and gewürztraminer. You can eat and drink what you buy on site try a degustación at La Despensa, an attractive, laid-back seating area or step into Montal’s spectacular restaurant set in an adjacent 16th-century Renaissance palace and dine richly in style. • Torre Nueva 29, montal.esSorrel DownerGlowing seductively on a chamfered corner of the smart Eixample neighbourhood, family-run Queviures Múrria is one of the last of Barcelona’s truly historic shops. Founded at the turn of the 19th century, it bursts with modernist flourishes in the carved wooden shelving and inked-glass advertisement panels bearing designs by Catalan artist Ramón Casas. The chiller cabinets groan with cheeses and charcuterie against a backdrop of extra virgin oils, champagne and cava (at €8, the house cava – light and fruity, and made with chardonnay – is a bargain in these lofty surroundings). On Christmas Eve, however, the queue stretches out of the door for the traditional handmade wafers known as neules, and boxes of moscovitas (crunchy, chocolate-drenched biscuits, €14).• Carrer de Roger de Llúria, 85, murria.catSally DaviesLaunched in 1930 by Elsa and Paul Käfer, this third-generation family business is where well-heeled Bavarians go to pick up baked goods and prepared dishes for holiday parties. The posh delicatessen in Schwabing boasts more than 800 types of wine and 350 cheeses, not to mention an assortment of charcuterie and seafood. If the selection seems overwhelming, the staff are happy to offer recommendations. Both the prices and the quality are exceptionally high, meaning locals tend to save their shopping splurge for the festive season. During the rest of the year, the small gastronomic empire does a brisk business in upscale catering. The family is also responsible for the only Oktoberfest tent where the guests are more likely to be drinking champagne than lager.• Prinzregentenstrasse 73, feinkost-kaefer.deDHIn an early-20th-century art nouveau building on Nevsky Prospect, Yeliseyev Merchants Food Hall is as lavishly decorated as some of the city’s palaces – with gold mouldings and stained-glass windows. Towers of chocolates and sweets (with a price tag to match) add to the luxury setting. There is a patisserie and confectionary section, a wine corner, a cafe, and a meat-and-cheese counter. Since Russia introduced sanctions on western meat and dairy produce in 2014, only Russian cheese can be purchased here it doesn’t boast a particularly good foodie reputation but might make a good curiosity purchase. For some Christmas spirit, check out the Nutcracker-themed window display and get mulled wine to take away (from £5), and festive chocolates – with Russian Santa or Father Frost designs – are popular as they were a traditional children’s gift even during the Soviet times (£6). It’s also right across the road from the Alexandrinsky theatre and a 15-minute walk from the Winter Palace.• 56 Nevsky Prospect, kupetzeliseevs.ruSasha RaspopinaThis small, family-owned local chain has several locations in Prague and is an oasis for homely Czech food in an often-overpriced and tourist-crowded city. The look of the shops is rather pedestrian but don’t let that drive you away – the simple canteen look is a part of the charm for the locals, who like to pop in for cakes, bread and jams or get snacks to eat at one of the stand-up tables by the windows. In the fresh food section, go for the traditional open sandwiches, chlebičky: bread rolls topped with various pates and spreads (try the creamy carrot and shredded beetroot ones). Also, search out cold cuts, cheeses, and traditional pastries in the shape of little wheels (liberske kolače), which are filled with fruit, and don’t miss melt-in-the-mouth cottage cheese and poppy-seed paste. You can even assemble a true Czech Christmas hamper by picking up raspberry and buckthorn jam, cherry and liqueur chocolates, traditional chocolate filled waffles and a bottle of local alcohol, such as sweet Republica rum or herby Becherovka.• 9 Vodičkova Street, liberskelahudky.czSROne of the oldest food shops in Paris, with a handsome facade unchanged since the Belle Epoque, À la Mère de Famille is not strictly a deli, but a gorgeous time capsule of a sweet shop. Its antique cabinets are laden with nostalgic French candies from chocolate orangettes (candied orange peel dipped in chocolate) to the famous calissons of Aix-en-Provence, a paste of crystallised melon and almonds covered in icing. French families are known to bring out impressive displays of “13 Desserts” after dinner a Provençale tradition that entails arranging 13 separate rows of candied fruits, biscotins (fancy biscuits), marzipan, nougat and other sugary delicacies on a tray. Stock up at the 250-year-old family-run shop and don’t forget the sweet wine for Santa’s night cap and a selection of pâte à tartiner (chocolatey spreads) for the breakfast table.• 35 rue du Faubourg Montmartre, lameredefamilleVanessa Grall, author of Don’t Be a TouristIn a city that’s constantly changing, food stalwarts are hard to come by but Schaller and Weber, founded in 1937, remains an Upper East Side institution. The German butcher-cum-specialty food store is one of the last vestiges of old Yorkville: a New York district that is historically Central European. And it still serves some of the finest charcuterie, smoked Bavarian Rauchkäse cheese, and bone broth in the city. Come Christmas, pick up imported marzipan ($6.99). Of course, nothing in New York has remained entirely impervious to change: next door, the owners have opened Stube, a trendy, if tiny, sandwich-shop serving Korean-fusion kielbasa and other high-end lunch fare.• 1654 2nd Avenue, schallerweberTara Isabella Burton"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/472c47d53618e85d04323e27e0a275737d74c5e9/0_101_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=707f68ded011ed6b3766b8fbdf97d6b3","title":"travel photographer of the year 2018 the winners","story":"Photographers from 142 countries submitted more than 20,000 images for this year’s TPOTY.

The buzzword? “Kind”.I know what you’re thinking – we’ve been told to be kind to each other for years. Everyone from Aristotle to Princess Diana has extolled its virtues as Mark Twain said: “Kindness is the language which the deaf can hear and the blind can see.”But the current iteration is different to the previous “pay it forward” variety. The new kindness is about putting yourself first – being “kindful”, in the same way you would be “mindful” in your day-to-day life. Why? Because if you’re not kind to yourself, how will you ever be kind to others?As with any new idea from the wellbeing world, some people have trouble getting on board. And I’ve noticed that kindfulness is a concept men especially can struggle with. After all, for decades guys were told to “man up” and encouraged to repress their feelings. Anything else was unmanly. It left generations unable to articulate their troubles at all.But with our mental health now a headline issue, 2018 feels like the tipping point – the moment when men say: “Enough is enough.”Matt Coyne, author of bestselling parenting guide Dummy: The Comedy and Chaos of Real-life Parenting, agrees. “Growing up, I was left in no doubt that a ‘real man’ should be tough, uncompromising and too busy eating red meat and reverse-parking efficiently to have feelings.“I’m not what anyone would describe as a ‘man’s man’. I like musicals, I struggle to grow a beard and I once cried watching Pitch Perfect 2. Being a stay-at-home dad isn’t for everyone, but I can definitely say that I feel fulfilled by it.”Coyne is an advocate of kindfulness in his own unique way. “I’m not someone who goes in for that whole standing in front of a mirror and shouting: ‘I’m a tiger!’” he says. “I’d feel like a bit of an idiot. But I constantly ask myself: ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’“Ditching parenting guilt has been a huge part of becoming a happier dad. It took me a while to work out that I will always be a bad parent – according to somebody. The greatest kindness parents can do themselves is realise that the only opinion that matters is your kid’s. As long as I’m the greatest dad to one person – my son – that’s good enough.”But while Coyne has happily shrugged off the stereotypes of what it means “to be a man”, many others are still struggling under the weight of expectation and the pressure that comes with attempting to be a doting dad, ambitious career man, loyal partner or perfect provider.The ManKind Project was formed in 1998 so men could get together and talk about the fact that society’s expectations of men are “based on power, control and invincibility”. It sets out a clear mission statement: to allow a man to live with confidence, and purpose, and create a life without fear for himself and those around him. In short – to learn to be kind to themselves each day.Experts agree that a seemingly small thing, such as altering a negative internal monologue, can have a significant impact. Steve Clarke is a leading psychotherapist at Priory’s Life Works residential rehabilitation centre in Woking, Surrey. He says that negative self-talk can be so ingrained that it makes men feel – perversely – as though they’re on the right track. He explains: “Many men believe they can identify a self-critical voice as that of a once-critical parent, partner or coach who used criticism as a way to motivate or punish.“An increase in male body dysmorphia, poor physical health due to neglect among some, poor work-life balance and financial woes can all lead to a negative self-image,” Clarke adds.“It’s important to take a step back and recognise your value. Ask some people you respect to describe your best qualities. It’s good to be reminded of our strengths, and it helps to improve self-esteem.”According to Clarke, other acts of kindfulness that can go a long way to achieving that much-craved sense of contentment include taking 10 minutes out of the day to spend by yourself. “Use this time to remind yourself that you have the simple things in life – food in your belly, a roof over your head, money in your pocket, running water, love, compassion and good health. You’ll feel rich beyond all measure,” he says.So what other kindful acts can you bring into your life? How about a rethink of your relationship with your mobile phone? Even workaholic Simon Cowell has gone phone-free. “I literally have not been on my phone for 10 months,” the music mogul revealed this year. “I became more aware of the people around me and way more focused. It has been so good for my mental health. It really is good for you and it has absolutely made me happier.”Psychotherapist Padraig O’Morain, who has also written a book on kindfulness, believes that this form of self-care can transform anyone’s life for the better. “People who practise self-compassion are good at taking on challenges … it is often our own condemnation that we most fear,” he says.But how easy is it to apply kindfulness to your own life? Writer Chris Brock was experiencing crippling anxiety when he had a self-care epiphany.“I suffered with anxiety to the point where my head was constantly buzzing with negative thoughts: that I was a failure, I wasn’t good enough and maybe I’d be better off dead,” says Brock, who has just written a book about his experiences, Do the Thing, Have the Power: Overcome Self-Doubt and Build a Life You Love.“Someone said to me: ‘Thoughts aren’t fact’, but I struggled with this for about six months,” says Brock. “One day, those anxious voices were beating me up and I said out loud: ‘Shut up!’ It was at that moment that I realised that our thoughts are not us. And that led me on a road to meditation, mindfulness, and taking ownership of my life.”Brock put a programme of self-care into practice: drinking more water, starting a gratitude journal to focus on the positive in his life, and avoiding reading too much negative news.“This is a lifestyle change and something you need to practise every day,” he says. “I soon noticed the change in myself and became aware of how good I could feel.”“Negativity is just really hard work and energy-sapping so I really like the idea of kindfulness as a kind of counterbalance,” Coyne adds. “I really think there’s something to it for men.”Caroline Millington is author of Kindfulness (£10, Head of Zeus) out on 4 October 2018Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s treating yourself well or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

It’s a big occasion for many reasons: I’ll be making a lifelong commitment to the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met, it’s the most expensive thing I’ve ever done, and it will also be the first time that my family have seen me cry in public since an ill-advised midnight screening of Ghostbusters II.But having just read Jamie Maple’s excellent article for this series about taking his wife’s surname, it occurs to me that it’s significant for another reason: it’s also the day that my surname is Killed.No, that’s not a stray capitalisation on the “K” of “Killed”. My fiancee’s surname is “Killin”, mine is “Duggins”. After we marry, we’ve decided to put them together to create a new surname: “Killduggins”. As a mark of how much I love my partner, I’ll spend the rest of my life with a surname that sounds like it’s being uttered by a mafia boss whose family I’ve just disrespected.The main reason for it is feminism. As a pair of self-avowed feminists, we’re keen to try to rethink the way we approach getting married – an institution whose ideas about women are, to put it politely, very much rooted in the past.So the idea of asking the person I love the most in the world to change her surname – a key part of who she is – and start using mine instead? You might as well have asked me to scorch her bum with a hot branding iron, grunt “You mine now, wench” and manacle her to a kitchen sink. For me, that’s what it would feel like.Obviously this isn’t to say there’s anything wrong with women taking their husband’s surnames. But for me and my fiancee, there’s something about creating our own joint surname that feels perfect. Neither of us is asking the other to subjugate our identity to the other, and it goes one step further than just having a double-barrelled surname. Instead, we’re creating an entirely new, joint identity that draws upon our existing ones. Merging our surnames says: “No-one owns anyone in this relationship – it’s a genuine partnership.”We’re doing this because we think it’s a genuinely romantic thing to do. But by appending “Kill” to the beginning of my surname we have, admittedly, also had a bit of fun with its exact wording. After all, if you’re going to create a brand new identity to recognise your union, it should probably be one that says something about your personalities – and we’re nothing if not a bit silly. Hopefully, one day, we’ll have tiny Killduggins children who will reinforce the fact that men and women are equal partners in relationships with every utterance of their surname. But they’ll also have people say things to them like: “Killduggins: What is that? Irish?” And they’ll have to sigh: “No, my parents just picked a surname whose wording made them smile.”To date, I haven’t had a single person ask me if I’ll be sad to lose my surname. In fact, most people tend to think it’s quite sweet – albeit in a deliberately silly way. My partner was briefly worried that my family might not be so cool about it, particularly given the “Kill” adjunct to my surname. But I’m pretty sure they’re fine with it. I mean, if I’m honest, I haven’t even asked them. They’re decent, reasonable people, so I can’t imagine them objecting to the idea of wanting a surname that doesn’t imply ownership of your wife.Actually, for me, that’s it in a nutshell. Despite what the evidence tells me in terms of the lack of other people I know who are taking a joint surname, I don’t actually think there’s anything particularly unusual about what we’re doing.As men in a modern world, shouldn’t we be doing things that reflect our values? Shouldn’t we be trying to reshape the past into a future that reflects our identity and the things that matter to us?All I know for sure is that by creating a joint name for my soon-to-be wife and me, I feel like we’re adding something extra special to our wedding day. I don’t just get to marry the love of my life. I get to create a future that is uniquely, irrefutably ours and ours alone – which is what marriage is really all about.Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s creating your own surname or finding a grooming routine that works for you.

So how do three LGBT guys define manliness in 2018?Here, three men – one gay, one bisexual and one trans – reveal what modern masculinity means to them.Throughout my school years I felt that I couldn’t do anything right. I was always a very dainty child, and growing up on a council estate I felt like an alien who’d been dropped down from outer space. I had a girlie voice and feminine mannerisms, and everything I did was jumped on.When I went to university, I started to get good-looking girlfriends, and people left me alone, but I was still repressing myself. Being with women didn’t feel quite right I just didn’t want to be gay.Eventually, at 24, I came out and life began. But even though I’d started to care less about conforming, I still battled with a lot of internalised homophobia. In the gay community, masculine men are seen as more attractive, so again I ended up compromising myself.I still have days where I’m conscious of my behaviour being “too” effeminate, especially when I’m in a professional capacity or meeting someone for the first time, but I’ve become more accepting of myself with time. Sometimes I feel sorry for straight men who can cry at a football match but would feel embarrassed and unmanly telling their partner they love them – I think that’s really sad.In a way it’s quite freeing that it’s generally OK for a gay man to be seen as emotional, and that it isn’t seen as a sign of weakness. I think straight people can benefit from having an LGBT friend, because we have a different perspective, informed by our experiences. In a way, I’m glad that I haven’t necessarily had the easiest ride, because it’s made me a more rounded person.When I was single and using dating apps, I found that things would be going well until I mentioned that I dated both men and women – then women would stop replying or suddenly realise that they weren’t over their ex.My girlfriend gets strange comments, like, “Are you the one dating a gay guy?”, and my masculinity has definitely felt under attack at times. I’ve found myself wondering whether I’m manly enough – I think those are feelings that a lot of men struggle with, whether gay, straight or bi.We’re all supposed to aspire to being super macho, but I hope we’re starting to realise that there’s more than one way of being a man. In fact, my girlfriend would say that dating a bisexual man is better, because I have a more flexible mindset. I don’t assume that she’ll do the washing up because she’s a woman, or that I’ll do the DIY because I’m a man. She tells me I’m one of the manliest people she knows, not because I have the deepest voice or the broadest shoulders, but because I know who I am, and I never feel the need to pretend to be anyone else.For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt male. Even when I was four years old, my mum remembers me crying and telling her I felt like a boy trapped in a girl’s body. Then, when I was eight, I played on a boys’ basketball team and nobody thought to question it.It was only when I started high school that things got weird. I tried to fit in because I didn’t want to get teased, but I’d overhear people asking, “Is that a boy in a skirt?” My mum would help with my makeup and take me shopping, but it felt like I was doing drag. Coming from a small town, I didn’t even know what it meant to be trans all I knew was how I felt.Then, once I started to transition, I made a lot of effort to be ultra masculine, spending lots of time in the gym so that I’d “pass” as a man. These days, I’m much more comfortable with myself and I’m not afraid of my feminine side, because I know it doesn’t stop me being male.People sometimes think I’m gay, because I can be a bit camp, and I’m OK with that. I do comedy videos online, and, funnily enough, most of the characters I’m known for are women. Some people don’t realise I’m trans and post comments saying, “If you like being women so much why don’t you just become one?” I think: “Been there, done that!”Photography: Dan Wilton for Do what feels right with Philips: whether that’s being true to yourself or a finding grooming routine that works for you.

The Czech leader’s son recently said he had been lured to Crimea and abducted to stop him testifying about his father’s business interests.Voting in Strasbourg, MEPs said all funds paid “illegally or irregularly” should be recovered and called for a full and transparent investigation to resolve the conflict of interest.Speaking before the vote, Babiš said he had always acted within Czech law.The parliament also called on EU leaders and ministers to take action to prevent conflicts of interest when drawing up rules for the next long-term EU budget.“Business and politics is a delicate combination that should not leave any doubts for a conflict of interest,” said Ingeborg Grässle, a German MEP who chairs the parliament’s budget control committee and co-authored the resolution. Babiš’s role as the head of the Czech government, with his business, “obviously create this conflict”, she said.EU lawyers concluded that Babiš was in a conflict of interest in a confidential legal opinion seen by the  last month, and which MEPs cited in the resolution.MEPs voiced regret that the European commission, which controls EU funds, had remained passive despite “strong indications” of a conflict of interest when Babiš became Czech finance minister in 2014.Babiš, the second richest man in the Czech Republic, has always denied any conflict of interest, and says Agrofert is in a blind trust he does not control. Agrofert also rejects the claims.“For me, this is a political affair. I am convinced it will be shown that I do not have any conflict of interest,” Babiš said on Czech Television before the vote.Parliament sources are unable to recall such formal censure of a serving EU leader. MEPs raised concerns about corruption and conflicts of interest in Hungary in a September vote, but avoided naming names. The text referred to “the prime minister’s son-in-law”, a reference to an investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud office into street lighting contracts awarded to István Tiborcz, who is married to the daughter of Viktor Orbán.Philippe Lamberts, the co-leader of the Greens, which initiated the resolution, said the commission had to act to resolve the issue. “The Czech authorities cannot be expected to effectively rule against their own prime minister,” he said. “EU money is taxpayers’ money and we cannot let it be funnelled off by the rich and powerful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3730486.1544723196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"german ngo defends climate change rating of ireland as worst in eu","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“The criticism of prime minister Leo Varadkar falls short.” Photograph: John ThysPoolEPAOne of the compilers of an index of climate-change performance that rated Ireland as the worst in the EU has strongly rejected Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s questioning of its standing.Jan Burck of the Bonn-based environmental Germanwatch, one of the authors of Climate Change Performance Index 2019 published this week, said the index “is based on standardised scientific criteria. The data for 12 of our 14 indicators is drawn from official statistics.”Mr Varadkar added: “We need to make a distinction between report cards, claims and assertions made by campaign organisations as opposed to those made by official bodies such as the CSO, the UN or the EPA, between official statistics and those that are calculated by an NGO or an advocacy group that has a particular agenda.”Germanwatch and the NewClimate Institute, in co-operation with national experts, undertake the assessment annually and have published the index for the past 14 years. “Both organisations are fully independent and do not work for profit. All ratings and indicators are described in a detailed and transparent manner,” Mr Burck said in a statement issued in Katowice.“The criticism of prime minister Leo Varadkar falls short, as he only refers to one out of the 14 indicators. Emissions in Ireland are still increasing if one looks at a five-years trend, no matter if 2016 or 2017 is taken into account as the latest data reference,” he said.The underlying method of the index was standardised for all the assessed countries. “In addition, it is important to note that the index is a comparative measure evaluating a country’s performance in relation to the other countries included in the assessment.”He confirmed 80 per cent of the assessment of countries’ performance was based on quantitative data on carbon emissions, renewable energy and energy use from internationally recognised and accepted data sources”.Twenty per cent of the assessment is based on the policy evaluation of national experts from NGOs and think-tanks. All together 14 indicators are taken into account to assess a country’s performance.The Taoiseach had referred specifically to one indicator: emissions trend. “However, he only refers to a one-year trend from 2016 to 2017, mentioning the reduction of emissions by 0.9 per cent in 2017,” Mr Burck said.The index takes into account a five-year trend, as a one-year trend can be easily misinterpreted through events such as a warm or cold winter or rapid developments of the economic growth rates, he said. “For the period from 2011 to 2016, we do not see a decline in the emissions but rather a growth of 7.5 per cent.”The level of the per-capita emissions at 14.4 tons in Ireland was significantly above the EU average of 7.9 tons and the seventh-highest per-capita emissions of all assessed countries, he said.“We always try to show a balanced picture of a country. Apart from pointing at shortcomings, the assessment for Ireland by national experts also acknowledged positive developments such as the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill.”Ireland had also seen an increase of renewable energy in use of 48 per cent in the five-year period up to 2016."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand  AFP Getty ImagesPerhaps the time will come in this intractable, interminable saga of Britain leaving the European Union, when Ireland is squeezed. When the interests of a small member state will be weighed against the union as a whole and Ireland is, ah, persuaded to ease off slightly on its demands for a cast-iron guarantee that no border will again ide the island.When the “solidarity” – a favourite word here in Brussels – and support extended to Ireland reaches its limits as the prospect of the serious economic dislocation promised by a sudden, disorganised British exit weighs heavier and heavier in the inner chambers of the European decision-makers.This has been the secret Irish fear. It has been given voice by people who know what they are talking about, such as Bertie Ahern. And it has been a central part of what passes for the British strategy, if the sorry procession of bluster, brinkmanship and retreat led by Theresa May can be called such a thing.But on the evidence of this latest European summit, that time has not yet come. Nor is there any sign of it in the middle distance.One by one, EU leaders lined up on Thursday to reiterate the simple maxim: the deal is the deal. The backstop stays. No other deal is on offer.Emmanuel Macron emphasised that discussions on Brexit at the summit would be “political” not “legal”.Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said that the offer on the table was very good and will not be renegotiated. Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurtz said: “I spoke yesterday with Prime Minister May over the phone and explained to her that a reopening of the Brexit agreement is simply not possible.”Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that EU leaders could “listen and offer clarifications.”However, he said, “it will be impossible to break open the negotiated withdrawal agreement. That is a given.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said it too. He said the EU is “very keen to offer explanations, clarifications, assurances, anything that may assist MPs to understand the agreement. And hopefully to support it. But the backstop is not on the table.”In response, Mrs May played down the expectations of an “immediate breakthrough.” It wasn’t clear who exactly harboured these expectations.The Irish know what they are talking about when it comes to declarations, clarifications, statements of intention, political assurances that can sometimes follow contentious European treaties. There have been protocols on abortion (Maastricht), declarations on neutrality (Nice), assurances on the size of the European Commission (Lisbon) and guarantees which were a binding agreement under international law but only became part of EU law when converted into a protocol some years later (also Lisbon).If you can’t ratify a treaty, the EU has a bag of procedural wheezes designed to make the task easier.But what it can’t – and won’t do – and the common thread between all the above is change the text and legal effect of the treaty itself. The Irish were repeatedly assured that treaties that had nothing to do with neutrality and abortion had nothing to do with neutrality and abortion. That is unlikely to suffice in this case.Mrs May’s problem is not that people are afraid the treaty is about something that it is not it is that they object to what it is about. They object to the backstop. The very clear position in Brussels on Thursday night – at this stage anyway – is that the backstop is not changing.That means, as the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, in Brussels for a meeting of the European liberals on the fringes of the summit, observed, that the ball is in Westminster’s court.Trouble is, Westminster hasn’t a clue whether it wants to run, pass or kick. Truth be told, Westminster doesn’t really know what game it is playing.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Ludovic MarinAFPGetty ImagesAfter a “very long meeting” with Mrs May in Brussels on Thursday, before a meeting there of all EU leaders, Mr Varadkar strongly reiterated that the agreement on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU would not be reopened. Mr Varadkar’s comments came a day after Mrs May survived a confidence vote among MPs from her own Conservative Party, which was called amid concerns over the Brexit deal, particularly in relation to the backstop provision.The backstop is a default option to avoid a hard Border in Ireland after Brexit, unless and until alternative arrangements covering the issue are made.Mrs May had earlier cancelled a planned vote in the House of Commons on accepting the Brexit deal as the motion faced almost certain defeat.“The deal we have is the only deal on the table,” Mr Varadkar said, echoing a line that every European leader has repeated on their way into the summit in Brussels on Thursday afternoon. He said he hoped the deal could still be ratified in the coming weeks.“When it comes to the assurances that prime minister May is seeking,” he said, “the EU is very keen to offer explanations, clarifications, assurances, anything that may assist MPs to understand the agreement. And hopefully to support it. But the backstop is not on the table.” Asked if those assurances should be legally binding, Mr Varadkar said: “I don’t think we could agree to anything that would change the content of the treaty, so we’ll have to work out exactly what those assurances are . . . But what I can say is that the backstop is not on the table.” Mr Varadkar reiterated that the UK could take away the threat of a no-deal Brexit outcome by withdrawing from or pausing the article 50 exit process. He said that he had “certainly discussed some ideas” with Mrs May about what clarifications or assurances would assist her in passing the treaty through the House of Commons, but said he would prefer not to discuss specifics in public. He added that there was “nothing in writing”. Pressed as to whether Mrs May’s proposals at the meeting were acceptable, he said: “I have to say, some of the suggestions she made made sense – others I thought were difficult.“But what I said unequivocally is that we wanted to be helpful, we want to help this deal over the line, we’re willing to talk about explanations, clarifications, statements explaining what the deal means, but we couldn’t have anything that contradicted what’s in the deal. Because that would mean reopening the withdrawal agreement and the entire European Union is unequivocal that this deal could not be reopened.” He added that it should be possible to assure the British government that an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK could be negotiated quickly.He said that if the backstop was invoked, it need only be for a short period of time. However, he stressed that the provision could not be time-limited. “If the backstop has an expiry date, if there is a unilateral exit clause, then it’s not a backstop . . . and that would mean reopening the substance of the withdrawal agreement and the EU is unequivocal that’s not happening.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

That is the Irish position, and it is the European position as well,” he said. “That any clarification that arises in terms of the backstop would be of a political nature – give assurance that this is temporary, that it may never come into operation and that an alternative operation will be put in place as quickly as possible and that would be the collective ambition of all of the EU states.”Asked what Fianna Fáil was getting out of the renewal of the confidence-and-supply agreement, Mr Martin replied, “This isn’t about Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael – it’s about the country. The bottom line is we are facing a huge threat.”Mr Martin said it would be “highly reckless and irresponsible” to have an election now.Mr Martin said that the situation has “to a certain extent gone out of control – I mean the British prime minister couldn’t put the vote to parliament, 20 British ministers have resigned, there’s been three Brexit secretaries, there’s been two foreign ministers. It’s fairly unstable. I don’t think we can take chances in Ireland on that.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3729273.1544640884!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit comes down the priority list for jaded divided eu leaders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker talks to UK prime minister Theresa May. Photograph: Dario PignatelliBloomberg“My country is in flames,” Bruno Le Maire told fellow finance minsters last week, imploring on them the necessity and urgency of measures that would show the ordinary people of France that the EU hears them and feels their pain: a tax on the profits of wealthy giant digital companies, a stability mechanism and budget for the euro.His point was emphasised ahead of Thursday’s EU summit by the brutal attack in Strasbourg, and in a paradoxical way by his leader’s weekend U-turn and concessions to the crowd.No, Brexit is not the only issue on the agenda and in the subtext of the European leaders’ summit on Thursday and Friday. Issues that many of them see as of equal moment loom large – France on fire, Italy thumbing its nose at EU budget rules (both will be avoided by leaders, not least because the French have torn up budget plans in a rather Italian fashion), migration reform deadlocked, Poland and Hungary up on charges for rule-of-law breaches, looming European elections and the threat of populism, a trade war with the US, Russian naval adventurism in the Sea of Azov ... and Brexit too.They will listen to Mrs May on Thursday afternoon and ask her a few questions about what she feels she needs. Later on Thursday evening, leaders of the EU27 will discuss what they can do to help her. Senior EU officials were coy about what form this would take – at a minimum, the standard “council conclusions” expressing their support again for the terms of the withdrawal treaty, insisting it can not be renegotiated, but offering to “clarify” elements of concern to her.As one senior EU official put it, “I don’t know what is possible. I know what is impossible. The rest can be negotiated.”Most likely they will kick the can down the road – there’s been much of that – and defer considering the language of any “reassurance”, declaration, protocol or treaty addendum until the new year, not least because lawyers will need to pore over it.One senior diplomat briefing journalists expressed a somewhat jaded, but not untypical, view of British special pleading – after all, he said, the final version of the backstop is based on a British demand for an all-UK customs union. Yet that is now apparently the problem, he complained.There will be a strong message about the need to accelerate no-deal planning.The leaders will be most keen to emphasise the real success story of the summit – the deeply unsexy and largely uncontentious work of completing economic and monetary union and banking union. “Europe working, even off the media radar,” was how one ambassador put it.Finance ministers have prepared a package of measures for leaders’ approval that range from further developing the union’s bailout mechanism, the ESM, to enable it to assist states in financial trouble before and after a crisis, agreement on operationalising a backstop – the mot du jour – for the banking Single Resolution Fund it case it is overwhelmed by the collapse of a giant, and measures for risk reduction in banking and reducing non-performing loans.Where there are disagreements still, the summit will agree further work, on issues such as a common deposit insurance scheme and Franco-German proposals for a first euro-zone budget with a “convergence and competitiveness” funding mechanism.There will be a long debate on the next seven-year, post-Brexit EU budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework, the first time that leaders will have had a real chance to air their respective national concerns – and there are many.The British hole in the finances and the inclusion of a number of new policy priorities such as defence, a euro budget and the expansion of science spending have all combined to ide member states between net contributors and beneficiaries, rural versus urban prioritisers, backers of cohesion funding. The aspiration to get agreement by next summer looks utopian.And on migration there will also be isions – notably on the complete failure of the Austrian presidency to advance the “Dublin” file, the asylum regulations that the Italians, Greeks, and Spanish would like to see requiring mandatory resettlement of asylum applicants from the front line state where they land to other member states.Resolute opposition to such proposals led by Hungary has resulted in complete deadlock and paralysed the passage of other less controversial external measures.In recent days the French and Germans are reported to have put forward new proposals that would allow member states reluctant to take asylum seekers to provide alternative “solidarity” in the form of cash or other assistance. But it is unlikely that any of the package of measures will be agreed today.Over dinner tonight they will discuss foreign policy and are expected to renew sanctions against Russia."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3730540.1544725495!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit varadkar tells may changes to irish backstop not on the table","story":"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar arrives at a European Union leaders summit in Brussels. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar speaks to British prime minister Theresa May upon her arrival at a European Summit to discuss the Brexit deal, the long-term budget and the single market. Photograph: Getty Taoiseach Leo Varadkar held a lengthy meeting with British prime minister Theresa May in Brussels this morning ahead of a summit of European Union leaders where Mrs May will outline “legal assurances” she believes MPs want before they will back her Brexit deal.After the meeting Mr Varadkar reiterated that renegotiating the Brexit withdrawal agreement was not an option.“The deal that we have is the only deal on the table . . . while it is far from perfect, I believe it is good for Britain and good for the European Union and I sincerely hope that it can still be ratified,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the EU would try to offer explanations and assurances that may assist MPs understand the agreement “but the backstop is not on the table”.The backstop is a default option enshrined in the Brexit deal designed to ensure there will be no hard Border in Ireland unless and until alternative arrangements covering the issue are made.When asked if these assurances could be legally binding, Mr Varadkar said: “I don’t think we could agree to anything that would change the content of the treaty, change the content of the withdrawal agreement.”Mr Varadkar also reiterated that the UK could take away the threat of a no-deal Brexit outcome by withdrawing from or pausing the article 50 exit process.Mrs May arrived in Brussels to lobby European leaders for changes to the Brexit withdrawal agreement after she survived a confidence vote that highlighted the British political deadlock over the UK’s exit from the EU next March.“We need to get this deal over the line,” Mrs May said on arrival, adding she had “heard loud and clear” the concerns of rebels from her own Tory party who had tried to unseat her over the Brexit deal, which she agreed with EU leaders last month.“I don’t expect an immediate breakthrough,” Mrs May added, but she said she would be telling other leaders of the “legal and political assurances” her party sceptics needed, especially over the risk of the backstop becoming permanent.However, the dilemma Mrs May faces is the same as before the confidence vote: how to convince the EU to tweak the withdrawal agreement so that it will be passed by the British parliament.The scale of her challenge is clear from the text of draft summit “conclusions” leaked to journalists in Brussels on Thursday.These reaffirm the commitment of EU leaders to the withdrawal agreement and political declaration and state that they plan to step up preparations for a no-deal scenario.“The backstop is only intended as an insurance policy to prevent a hard Border on the island of IrelandIt is the Union’s firm determination to work speedily on a subsequent agreement that established by December 31st, 2020 alternative arrangements, so that the backstop will not need to be triggered.”The use of December 31st, 2020, refers to the end of the transition period following Brexit.The draft states: “The European Council also underlines that, if the backstop were nevertheless to be triggered, it would apply only temporarily unless and until it is superseded by a subsequent agreement.“In such a case, the Union would use its best endeavours to negotiate and conclude expeditiously a subsequent agreement that would replace the backstop, so that it would only be in place for a short period and only as long as strictly necessary.”Leaders will consider whether further assurances may be required but “such assurance will not change or contradict the withdrawal agreement”.EU diplomats insist the language in and out of brackets represents no more than a reiteration of the commitments made in the withdrawal agreement.French president Emmanuel Macron was blunt ahead of the meeting on Thursday. “We can have a political discussion tonight, but the legal framework and the agreement that were negotiated are not supposed to change,” he told reporters.German chancellor Angela Merkel was less strident, saying: “We can of course talk about whether there are additional assurances but in this the 27 EU members are together and will make their interests clear, although always in the spirit that we want very, very good relations with Great Britain after Great Britain has left the European Union.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, suggested there could be a special Brexit summit in January to agree “additional assurances” which could be attached to the political declaration on the UK’s future relationship with the EU.However, former European Commission president José Manuel Barroso tweeted that “wisdom should prevail” and the EU should find a “creative solution” to the backstop issue, due to the importance of its relationship with the UK.Speaking outside 10 Downing Street after the confidence vote on Wednesday, Mrs May said she would seek assurances on the backstop when she attends the European Council meeting.“I will be seeking legal and political assurances that will assuage the concerns that members of parliament have on that issue,” she said.She promised to find a legally binding solution to the backstop that would satisfy the DUP, saying the Brexit deal could only win a majority in the House of Commons with the support of the DUP, which props up the British PM’s minority government.She added it would not be a success to pass a Brexit deal only to be unable to govern afterwards.“We emphasised that tinkering around the edges would not work. We were not seeking assurances or promises. We wanted fundamental legal text changes,” Ms Foster said in relation to the Brexit deal on Wednesday.Mrs May will address the other 27 EU leaders on Thursday evening and they will later discuss Brexit without her.A Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed on Thursday that it was the British government’s aim to hold the vote in the House of Commons on the Brexit “as soon as possible in January”.

Theresa May’s 200-117 victory in Wednesday’s confidence vote was clear enough to be decisive but close enough to ensure that she will continue to face a large, mutinous bloc of backbenchers. She won in part because she promised MPs that they will not have to face the electorate again under her leadership.More than a third of Conservative MPs, probably including more than half of those on the backbenches, no longer have confidence in her leadership. But Conservative Party rules mean she is immune to another challenge to her leadership for 12 months, by which time Britain should have left the European Union.With no risk of being ousted and no hope of leading her party into another election, the prime minister no longer has to look over her shoulder. She could, for example, seek to unlock a cross-party majority for a soft Brexit in defiance of hardline Brexiteers in her own party and in the DUP. But her innate caution and the promises she made on Wednesday to stay in power suggest that such a bold course remains the remotest of possibilities.The prime minister made two commitments to MPs: to leave office before the 2022 general election and to secure a legally binding solution to the Northern Ireland backstop that would win the DUP’s support for her Brexit deal. Her acknowledgement that she could not lead her party into the next election moved some ministers to tears and may have persuaded a couple of dozen MPs to vote for her.But her declaration that no Brexit deal could pass without the support of the DUP was more consequential, setting a bar for the next stage of negotiations with the EU that may be impossible to overcome. She told MPs that it would not be a success to pass a Brexit deal only to find that, without the support of the DUP, she could not govern.May had what she described as a positive meeting on Wednesday afternoon with DUP leader Arlene Foster and her deputy Nigel Dodds. The DUP have made clear that nothing short of a unilateral exit mechanism that would effectively kill the backstop will satisfy them.The EU is open to offering clarifications on the backstop, although senior officials say no new legally binding text can encroach on the terms of the backstop set out in the withdrawal agreement, which cannot be renegotiated. May’s commitment to find a solution the DUP can accept could set her on a course that makes a deal with the EU impossible.\u0026nbspOr it could simply be the latest in the long trail of broken promises that has littered her premiership from the day she entered Downing Street.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Architects have been added to the latest guidelines.Nick Gore, associate at Carter Thomas solicitors, said the move appeared to follow cases of prominent entertainers and models being denied access to the UK. “It’s always been extremely difficult for fashion designers and models to ender under the regular routes,” he said.“Taking into account the prominence and success of the UK’s fashion industry, this has clearly been an oversight by the Home Office.”Mike Illes, of MOT Models, said this summer eight South African models had been initially been refused entry, forcing them to appeal successfully. “It was an unjustified rejection of work permits,” he said. “It was absurd given the demand for them during the summer in the UK.”Brexit latest: Theresa May suggests she could stay on as PM for another three years as EU rejects plea to rework backstopPub that banned ex-soldier from bringing in his pet ferrets accused of \u0026#39discrimination\u0026#39Trump admin vows to tackle Russia and China\u0026#39s \u0026#39predatory\u0026#39 practices in AfricaJudge praises parents of sick baby girl who let him rule that their daughter should be allowed to dieRoald Dahl\u0026#39s war medals reunited with his family - 73 years after he left the RAFComment: Does anyone really believe Theresa May’s promise to step down?Comment: Eurozone problems are a greater threat to our economic stability than a no-deal BrexitComment: When Remainer MPs savage the views of Brexiteer colleagues, they risk insulting millions of Leave voters\u0026#39MeToo\u0026#39 victory in US Congress as politicians change sexual harassment rules Police officers asked to fill in forms if they shout at suspects while restraining themScottish workers may not apply for promotions thanks to extra tax burden, official forecaster warnsBreaking: Police respond to threat at Columbine high schoolJoe Sugg\u0026#39s Strictly Diary: \u0026#39Winning Strictly would cap off the best time of my life\u0026#39Computer genius built a fraud machine to con savings from hundreds of bank customersSNP ministers urged to \u0026#39bin\u0026#39 their Brexit Bill after Supreme Court rules it exceeds their powersCabaret singer nicknamed \u0026#39the veteran\u0026#39s sweetheart\u0026#39 stalked by soldierBeware super-gonorrhoea: the gift nobody wants at ChristmasNational Portrait Gallery to tackle myth of male-only genius with exhibition of \u0026#39Pre-Raphaelite Sisterhood\u0026#39Comment: We need more than magic beans to help us offset the effects of climate changeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/13/TELEMMGLPICT000183297375_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8Asj1eHb3tSpQqwok7bWew_2zTAw3jNyFsrmT3RDi-w.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"new york times met sarcastic response asks british people tell","story":"The New York Times\u0026#39 appeal met with a sarcastic responseThe New York Times has received a sarcastic response after it asked British people to detail petty crimes they had been victims of in London.The newspaper, which has run a series of pieces about austerity and crime in Britain, asked its followers on Twitter: Have you experienced a petty crime in London?

But the firm’s plans have been delayed by numerous setbacks and the loss of the company’s previous space plane in a 2014 accident that killed co-pilot Michael Alsbury.“We’ve had our challenges,” said Mr Whitesides. “But to get to the point where we are at least in range of space flight is a big deal.”Sir Richard Branson with Virgin Galactic\u0026#39s space tourism rocketVirgin Galactic’s site, high in the Mojave Desert 100 miles north of Los Angeles, was abuzz with excitement on Wednesday, as the launch time crept closer.As Sir Richard made tea for the team, Mr Whiteside explained that the two pilots will take off at dawn and attempt to fly to 50 miles above the Earth – Nasa’s definition of space.Their craft, VSS Unity, will eventually hold six paying passengers, but on Thursday it will be just the two test pilots, plus a series of scientific instruments, and “Annie”, a mannequin fitted with sensors to study the effect of the journey on the body.“She’s coming along for the ride,” joked Mike Moses, president of Virgin Galactic, as he showed off for the first time the delicate pre-flight preparations on the eve of the launch. Virgin has never before permitted access to the hangar prior to a test flight.Dozens of technicians were making final checks on Wednesday, inspecting that the screws in both VSS Unity and the mothership, VMS Eve, and testing the torque of the panels.Earlier the test pilots had carried out a final trial run inside the simulator – a black-curtained cockpit in the corner of the hangar, where the curved screen provided a breathtaking vision of what the pilots would see from 50 miles above earth, as the atmosphere ends and the darkness of space begins.The hangar hummed with quiet focus the team of 750 employees excited for the challenge of the next day.“We are essentially learning how to best fly the trajectory to space,” said Mr Whitesides. “The craft will be flown to space – it’s not computer driven. So we’re learning the best piloting techniques.”At 7am ET (midday GMT) on Thursday, if conditions are right, VMS Eve – named after Sir Richard’s mother – will take off with VSS Unity attached. Climbing for around 45 minutes to a height of around 43,000ft, VSS Unity will then be released from VMS Eve. The pilots will pull the nose of the space craft sharply upwards for around 50 seconds – longer than ever before – and jet into the skies with a force approaching Mach three, travelling at almost three times the speed of sound.At its maximum height, the pilots will turn the craft upside down, so that the eventual passengers, weightless by now, can see the Earth below them. For several minutes they will stay at that height, taking in the view of 500 miles in every direction, before beginning the descent.VSS Unity, the Virgin Galactic space craft, is hoped to be piloted into space for the first time on Thursday“Gliding back down is relaxed – a nice welcome back to Earth,” said Todd Ericson, the vice president of safety and test, and a former F-16 fighter jet pilot who is also one of the test pilots.The most challenging part, he said, was the pivot upwards to go into space.“If this flight is relatively successful, I think we’ll be in a position to go to a full-duration flight,” added Mr Whitesides.Virgin Galactic has not set a date for its first commercial space flight, for which around 700 people, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Justin Bieber have signed up, paying $250,000 (£192,000).Virgin Galactic\u0026#39s mothership, VMS Eve, carries VSS Unity for its first flight, over Mojave on Thursday September 8, 2016But many people expect it to happen within a year, and Sir Richard has said he will be on the first trip, leaving the company’s New Mexico spaceport.Virgin Galactic’s main rival, Blue Origin, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has flown higher, but in a computer-operated craft, rather than one piloted by humans. They too are hoping to take their first commercial passengers in 2019.SpaceX, the company owned by Elon Musk, is focused on carrying equipment for Nasa’s programmes – although they do hope to take a Japanese billionaire around the moon by 2023.“This is a test flight, a no-kidding test flight, with all the novelty and excitement and risk,” said Mr Whitesides, on the eve of the flight.He was determined, he said, “to share that risk is a valuable part of forward progress.”The pilots may not decide to push for space on Thursday, and the conditions may not be right. Part of the process, he said, was checking how accurate their computer-generated models were against actual flight data.“I think it’s rare in modern society to bring people into the test flight,” he said. “It’s usually a pretty protected environment.“But I think it’s really important.”Please review our commenting policyPub that banned ex-soldier from bringing in his pet ferrets accused of \u0026#39discrimination\u0026#39Trump admin vows to tackle Russia and China\u0026#39s \u0026#39predatory\u0026#39 practices in AfricaJudge praises parents of sick baby girl who let him rule that their daughter should be allowed to dieRoald Dahl\u0026#39s war medals reunited with his family -

As a result, rents are expected to rise “modestly” over the next year, RICS said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

When the department store chain is included the number falls to £148.8. HoF knocked nearly £32m off the top.\u0026nbspThe, um, ‘Harrods of the High Street’, as Ashley has sought to brand his new toy, is proving every bit as pricey as the famous Knightsbridge department store to its new owner.Other Ashley bets, notably Debenhams, caused more pain in the form write downs totalling nearly £77m. He also has substantial stakes in Findel, French Connection, Game Digital, Goals Soccer Centres and the Iconix Brand Group. And he\u0026nbspbought Evans Cycles from its administrators too.\u0026nbspAll this at a time when the core Sports Direct business has held up remarkably well. Yes UK sales fell a little bit (0.2 per cent), but given the current retail climate that counts as a pretty good result.\u0026nbspIt often seems as if Ashley enjoys the practice of putting a pistol to his feet and emptying the clip into them. Yet there is a counter argument.Despite the money lavished on top business executives, they’re as inclined to groupthink as anyone else.\u0026nbspThe current consensus holds that department stores are doomed, the high street needs radical surgery, and there will be more retailers beating a path to administrators\u0027 doors\u0026nbspover the\u0026nbspcoming year. Ashley has repeatedly pushed back against that. HoF would be gone were it not for him. So would Evans, and others.\u0026nbspHe’s not above loudly calling\u0026nbspfor help (see his recent sparring\u0026nbspwith MPs). But he probably knows he’s not going to get it.\u0026nbspYet he’s still ploughing on at a time when no one else seems to want\u0026nbspto.\u0026nbspIt’s incredibly difficult to see him pulling it off.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

You could say it added another layer of icing to the crazy cake.\u0026nbspThe two chains say they need extra time - 11 days - to get their submissions in and to have them properly considered, hence their ‘reluctant’ decision to take this step, which is all but unprecedented, certainly in the history of the watchdog which was formed in 2014. It generally takes heat for moving too slowly.\u0026nbspSainsbury’s and Asda ask for more time to deal with CMA merger probeSainsbury\u0027s labels items needed by food banksAsda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons cut petrol and diesel pricesIs this amateur hour or do they have a point?The\u0026nbsppair argue\u0026nbspthat this is a very big deal with a lot of moving parts.

A\u0026nbspregulator’s lot is not a happy one.\u0026nbspThat said, this deal was first announced last April and the CMA’s investigation, which is scheduled to be completed in March, was fast tracked at the request of the merger partners, who opted to skip Phase One and move straight to the always inevitable Phase Two investigation.Now Phase One and Phase Two are very different processes. But let’s look at this in practical terms. If they’d wanted and needed\u0026nbspto string things out, and create extra time, it’s not as if they didn’t have the opportunity to do that.\u0026nbspNow, much later in the day, we have this.The CMA would tell you that it will consider the case on its merits regardless.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

When the committee asked him whether he could keep all of the House of Fraser branches open, Mr Ashley replied: “What person could keep 59 stores open – beside God? It’s impossible, it can’t be done.”Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: “Replica football strips and cut-price trainers have helped Sport Direct buck the downward trend on the high street, with sales up 4 per cent over the period. However, its quest to turn the House of Fraser stores it’s acquired into the “Harrods of the high street” comes at a cost.“As a result, full-year earnings growth is expected to come in lower than last year. Whether investors will be able to look past the headline figures and see Sports Direct as a true diamond in the rough remains to be seen.”Sports Direct shares dipped by 1 per cent in early trading.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

According to the letter, obtained by the , Mr Ashley offered Debenhams a £40m interest-free loan, which was rejected. In his message, the Sports Direct owner said: “November was the worst November for retailers in living memory.”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCan Mike Ashley turn around the high street when no one else is tryingMike Ashley tells MPs: ‘The internet is killing the high street’Sports Direct set for stormy AGM but Mike Ashley will win in the end“Additionally it is speculated that the company currently has a zero chance of survival.”Earlier this year, Debenhams announced plans to close up to 50 shops, putting 4,000 jobs at risk. The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

Newtownabbey, County Antrim, Northern Ireland“Some argue it is actually increasing in intensity,” astronomy blogger Dave\u0026nbspSamuhel\u0026nbsptold the website.The key to the\u0026nbspGeminids’ consistency is the celestial object that has triggered the meteor shower each year since the\u0026nbsp1800s, which orbits the Sun every 550 days or so.3. It’s named after the Gemini constellationThe\u0026nbspGeminids’ name is no accident: once it enters Earth’s atmosphere, the meteor shower seems to be coming from the Gemini constellation.In order to spot the\u0026nbspGeminid\u0026nbspmeteor shower, you should thus be looking towards the Gemini constellation, which is well positioned from\u0026nbsp10pm, the American Meteor Society explained.This gives the\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbspa rare status as a major shower experiencing significant activity before midnight.4. It’s also linked to a Greek godSo what exactly causes the\u0026nbspGeminid meteor shower? A celestial object called 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon\u0026nbsp– which is also the son of the solar deity Helios in Greek mythology.It belongs to the Apollo asteroid group, an ensemble of near-Earth asteroids.As 3200\u0026nbspPhatheon, it is followed by a trail of debris. Earth passes through its trail each year, resulting in the display.5. As many as 100 shooting stars are expected to light up the skyThe\u0026nbspGeminids\u0026nbsphave an hourly rate of 120, the highest listed on the American Meteor Society’s calendar for meteor showers.This means more than 100 shooting stars should appear – though\u0026nbspNASA\u0026nbspcalls the figure a “theoretical maximum” and warns that it represents the experience of a “perfect observer” gifted with “perfect skies”.People residing in suburbs can still expect to see about 30 or 40 meteors per hour, and those living in darker areas on the countryside will be able to spot a bit more than one shooting star per minute.Bad news for people in large cities such as New York or San Francisco: they will see “practically nothing” due to light pollution, the agency warned.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Sitting in a hotel room dressed in a baggy black hoodie, walking boots and jogging bottoms, the lean 33-year-old is itching to head out into the chilly London rain and walk to a nearby climbing gym.\u0026nbspFirst, though, we have to talk about Free Solo, which despite sounding like another entry in the interminable Star Wars franchise is in fact an intimate, occasionally hair-raising documentary, showing why Honnold is a man in a class of his own when it comes to climbing rock faces without equipment.Free solo climbing, or soloing, eschews ropes and all the other paraphernalia one normally associates with safety, and leaves just the climber alone on a wall, with nothing but a pair of rubber-soled rock shoes, and chalk for his or her fingertips. As such, it is climbing in its purest and most dangerous form, where one small slip or moment of distraction can be lethal. It’s like an Olympic sport where if you don’t get gold you die, offers expert climber Tommy Caldwell in the film.\u0026nbsp“I think that’s a little hyperbolic,” muses Honnold. But aren’t the stakes so high, you have to be perfect, I ask? “Not perfect, but you have to perform well. It really draws the best out of you. To me, free soloing has definitely always felt like a skills test where you’re like, ‘OK, have I progressed enough as a climber to feel comfortable doing this thing that otherwise could seem impossible?’”For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialWe thought it was impossible to free climb the Dawn Wall of El CapitanLast year that seemingly impossible\u0026nbspthing was becoming the first person to free solo Yosemite’s daunting\u0026nbspEl Capitan (or El Cap, as its known among climbers). Towering around 914 metres, the imposing granite monolith was first climbed in 1958 by a three-man team using ropes they took 47 days to reach the summit. Fifty-nine years later, Honnold, tracked by the Free Solo film crew’s cameras, scaled the edifice in three\u0026nbsphours and 56 minutes. The feat stunned the climbing world and had people reaching for superlatives.\u0026nbspI want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn\u0026nbspHe appears comfortable at the cutting edge, but suggests that the only reason many of his solos have been breakthroughs is because he’s in a one-horse race where such big projects are concerned. “There’s nobody else doing it. So it’s easy to be first if you’re the only person playing the game.”In Free Solo, his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, finds his desire to go further hard to understand. In one particularly difficult scene, she begs him to understand why she wants him to stay alive. He tells her he does, but he doesn’t feel obligated to stop. And anyway, he is already doing everything he can to mitigate the risks, he insists. Even so, this feels like cold comfort given the number of free soloers who have ended up dead – a point Caldwell gently but bluntly tries to drive home to his friend.\u0026nbsp“I knew a lot of those people and I know the whole stories, the context,” says Honnold. “I’ve known that stuff for many years. So it’s not as if that’s fresh knowledge that suddenly hits me like, ‘Oh that’s hard to deal with!’“In some ways it’s important to think about those things. I want to think about other people’s accidents and to remember what happened to some of my friends, because that’s how you learn. That’s how you make sure that doesn’t happen to you or you try your best to make sure that doesn’t happen to you.”\u0026nbspHonnold estimates he has free-solo climbed more than 35 routes\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)Honnold started climbing regularly in local gyms around the age of 10, but has enjoyed climbing, and looking at the world as a kind of adventure playground, for almost as long as he can remember. He tells me that as a young boy he’d go to services at a Catholic church, near his home in Sacramento, with his mother – until he rebelled and declared himself an atheist – and stare up at the vaulted ceiling and its big exposed beams. He wasn’t contemplating God or Heaven, but “imagining different ways to swing around between the beams and how you could run on that and jump to that. Obviously I never did it, though I did\u0026nbspclimb the outside as a teenager.”\u0026nbspHe also climbed on the roof of his school, and got a kick out of balancing on guard rails.“I love play structures. Like swinging around on monkey bars. But then I’m often the person running around on top of the monkey bar, jumping from one to the other, just seeing what your body can do and enjoying the feeling of the movement.”Ultimately, “climbing feels like play”, he says. “I think that is at the heart of my desire to be a climber.”\u0026nbspOK, I say, but there is feeling like you are playing, and then there is risking your life climbing walls thousands of feet high, without safety gear. How does the one lead to the other? Honnold smiles.\u0026nbsp“I mean, that’s where you take this love of doing a thing, and you combine it with this sort of innate desire to want to improve all the time. To push yourself. When you let that run away from itself for 20 years, you wind up taking on some really, really big challenges.”My father died in the summer, which took some of the pressure off of going to school. Not that he was overtly forcing me, but it was certainly part of itBy the time he went to Berkeley to study civil engineering, at age 19, Honnold was climbing in the gym five days a week, for two to three hours a day. It was a “pretty enthusiastic hobby”, but still not something he thought he could turn into a profession. In the meantime, he drifted on the current of his academic parents’ expectations and disinterestedly continued his education.\u0026nbsp“The expectation was to finish university and get a job and just follow the conventional path. But I had never really chosen that particular path. It’s not like I cared about my studies that much.”His parents had filed for orce after he graduated from high school (“They weren’t in an overtly bad relationship, but I just don’t think they were that into each other, really”), which became final in May of his freshman year. Two months later, his father, who had taken him to the gym and supported his climbing, suffered a fatal heart attack while running through Phoenix airport. Soon after, Honnold dropped out of Berkeley.\u0026nbsp“My father died in the summer, which, to be honest, took some of the pressure off of going to school,” he admits. “Not that he was overtly forcing me to go to university, but it was certainly part of it, which is the expectation that I would.”Instead of going back to class, he hit the road in the family minivan (his mother had recently inherited a car from her father, who died around the same time as her former spouse), and adopted the frugal lifestyle of a “dirtbag climber” around California. When the minivan broke down irreparably, after\u0026nbspa year and a half of touring, he got a bicycle and tent, until he could afford a replacement.\u0026nbspToday, he has sponsors, but at first he was just living from “month to month, seeking out the next adventure or challenge”. The concept of climbing for a living didn’t really exist at the time, so Honnold thought he would eventually “wind up in some peripheral industry, like guiding”.Honnold climbs through the enduro corner on El Capitan’s Freerider (National GeographicJimmy Chin)However, when he became the first to free solo the Regular Northwest Face route of another awe-inspiring peak in Yosemite, the 610-metre\u0026nbspHalf Dome, in 2008, the climb caught the attention of documentary makers who asked him to re-enact sections of the ascent, as well as parts of his solo of the 370m Moonlight Buttress in Utah’s Zion national park, five months earlier, for a short film. This would be the first time that anyone had seen or got a feel for what Honnold went through doing the climbs, because neither had been witnessed by anyone. \u0026nbsp“One of the things I really love about climbing is that people will take you at your word for the most outlandish climb,”\u0026nbsphe says. “You know, ‘Oh, I free-soloed Half Dome today.’ There is basically no evidence of me free-soloing Half Dome. Nobody saw it. I think I told a friend, ‘OK, I’m going back up tomorrow.’ And then I texted him when I was done or whatever.” This level of trust among climbers demands “scrupulous honesty”, so when I jokingly ask why he didn’t cheat and use some nearby equipment to get himself out of a potentially life-threatening situation during the Half Dome solo, because nobody would have known, he is suddenly, and understandably, lost for words.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspresult of the film shoot, Alone on the Wall, according to his 2015 memoir of the same name, did more than anything else (including a feature in Outside magazine and a breathtaking National Geographic cover photograph) to spread Honnold’s achievements to an audience beyond the “insular world of hardcore climbing”.After Half Dome, El Cap was “the next obvious step. But it was just such a big step, it took many, many more years until it seemed even remotely possible.”I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to dieOne of Honnold’s strengths is his ability to seemingly override his fear. In Free Solo, an MRI scan of his brain reveals that his amygdala, which initiates the automatic part of the fight or flight response, requires more stimulus than most people’s. This isn’t to say he doesn’t get scared though. When he was on Half Dome, in the previously mentioned hairy predicament he describes as “outrageous”, he certainly felt fear.\u0026nbspBy the time the climber had El Cap in his sights, he says: “I’d learned that I wanted to have a positive experience up there. I didn’t want to feel like I was about to die the whole time.“I mean, it’s not fun if you’re scared. And I climb for myself. I climb for fun. So if it’s really scary, there’s no real point in being up there.”To get himself where he wanted to be, Honnold reckons he did around a dozen other big free solos in Yosemite. None were\u0026nbspas prestigious as Half Dome, but they were “steps in the right direction. They were so challenging in different ways, and bigger, harder, in some way or another.” Finally, in 2015, he was doing a roped climb on El Cap, and for “whatever reason”, he suddenly thought, “This could maybe be possible.”Honnold peers over the edge of Glacier Point in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)He chose a route and started to break it down into sections, or pitches, logging the features of each in a journal. In his mind, he distinguishes between risk and consequence. The latter is a constant (if he falls, he dies) that he has no control over. The former, however, is a variable that he attempts to minimise through research, rehearsal (on ropes), intense focus, and visualisation. Thus, he noted and memorised every foothold and handhold of the most difficult sections, meticulously choreographing the movements, which he still remembers, he would use to get through them. For example, to essay a pitch known as the “boulder problem”, he elected to use a karate kick-like move, rather than try to leap and catch hold of a piece of wall.\u0026nbspHe was particularly concerned about a section of granite which while not very long, and easily overcome using a four-move sequence on a rope, was “super slippery”, and therefore highly dangerous in the context of what Honnold was trying to do.\u0026nbsp“You basically had to put your foot on this, like, ball of glass, and just hope that it stuck, because if it slipped, you’d die,” he says.\u0026nbsp“There just wasn’t really an adequate way to free solo it. So I pioneered this whole variation that went around that move in a 10-metre circle.”Having a film team shooting the climb added another element of potential danger. I bring up the story of Henry Barber, who almost died when he was distracted by a cameraman while being filmed free soloing on cliffs in Britain, and Honnold tells me about Peter Croft almost getting knocked off a wall by a cameraman – “which would be a kind of\u0026nbsphorrendous way to fall to your death”, he laughs.“The thing about it is the cameramen are hanging off\u0026nbspropes, so if they swing off at the side to get a good angle, it means that they’re loaded on this rope like a pendulum and if they come unclipped from whatever they’re in, they’re going to come swinging across the wall and potentially floss you off with the rope.“So those were exactly the kinds of things that the whole crew was super-mindful of on the Free Solo filming, because they didn’t want to cause an accident.”Honnold cleaning his van in Yosemite national park\u0026nbsp(National GeographicJimmy Chin)While training, Honnold slipped and severely sprained an ankle. It still wasn’t completely back to full strength when he tried to free solo El Cap for the first time in 2016, and he aborted the attempt mid-climb. He knew the game was up when he reached a point where “you have to trust your life to this one right foothold, and you’re just palming the wall. I can still visualise it,” he says, miming the movements.“My foot was swollen and it was dark, it was cold, I couldn’t feel my toes. I couldn’t really tell if my toes were exactly on the foothold. You know, I was going to trust my life to this little edge that I couldn’t feel, so I just immediately started cheating.”\u0026nbspFailing was “pretty disheartening and pretty depressing”, but soon he came to see the fact he had been able to “walk up the base of El Cap and start climbing” as a “big victory”. As he’d written in his book, just getting off the ground was going to be a challenge for anyone who attempted to solo the wall.\u0026nbsp“So even that felt like this huge milestone in some ways.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe was left feeling “quite a bit hungrier”, and went to Las Vegas to live, train and recover. He returned to Yosemite in the spring of last year, and on Saturday\u0026nbsp3 June, almost two years after he’d begun his preparations, achieved what he’d set out to do\u0026nbsp– the highlights of which are captured in beautiful, breathtaking, vertigo-inducing detail in Free Solo.‘Great Escape’ pilot’s rare Spitfire discovered on Norwegian mountainThe audacious Wordsworth who put mountaineering on the mapMan survives a week lost on mountain by eating beesAfter dreaming about soloing the wall for so long, I wonder if actually doing it had left a big El Cap-sized hole in Honnold’s life. “So far not so much,” he says. “Partly because there’s so many other climbing challenges I’m working on.”\u0026nbspThe week after his El Cap solo, he went to Alaska to prepare for an expedition to Antarctica. Now, while he is doing press for the film, he is back in the climbing gym, and “getting back to my roots, a little bit”.\u0026nbspHe has to be careful where he goes, though. In LA, recently, he was mobbed at a gym by fans, who turned what was meant to be a relaxing workout in between getting off a flight and giving a presentation in the evening, into a full-on, meet-and-greet-type experience. “I was like, to myself: ‘This is definitely not a relaxing, fun way to stretch after my flight. This is crazy! There’s way too many people!’ It is stressing me out just thinking about it,” he says, and I can hear his voice quavering.Still, he can handle it a lot better than the “shy, dorky loner” he was as a kid. Then, it would have been “like my worst nightmare”, he confesses. “Can you imagine? You’re too shy to talk to anybody and then you have to basically do public speaking every single night, and interviews and things.”Free Solo is going to bring Honnold to an even wider audience, and could even take him and the film’s team, headed by co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, to the Oscars. The film is an incredible record of an amazing feat, and will forever be a testament to the climber’s dedication and death-defying athleticism. \u0026nbsp“I can’t wait to show my kids and grandchildren\u0026nbspsome day,” enthuses Honnold, who says he’d like to have a family. “I mean, imagine me as an 85-year-old showing my grandchild: ‘Look what he used to be able to do! That’s cool!’”National Geographic Documentary Film\u0027s Free Solo is released in cinemas on 14\u0026nbspDecemberShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The cuts are being made in an attempt to slash costs, after the company reported its biggest ever loss of £492m in the year to 1 September. Sports Direct currently holds 29.7 per cent of Debenhams, just shy of the 30 per cent threshold at which an offer for the remainder of the company must be made, according to the UK takeover code. Mr Ashley said in his letter that he was concerned that the Debenhams board “doesn’t really seem to appreciate” the position that the company is in “and their responsibility to shareholders”. He added: “Sports Direct is Debenhams’ largest shareholder. What we are offering is a very public statement of support at a critical time for the Debenhams business.”The letter concluded with a request that Mr Bucher reconsider the offer of a loan, and respond by “lunch time Friday”. A spokesperson for Debenhams said: “We welcome Sports Direct’s proposal as a clear demonstration of their willingness to support the company. “However, as the offer came with conditions that could affect the interests of other stakeholders, while the board does not think it could accept the proposal, as presented, it has invited Sports Direct to engage as part of our broader refinancing process.”Shares in Debenhams were down 4.89 per cent to 5.45 at close of trading on Thursday, while Sports Direct’s stock tumbled by 14.8 per cent to 235.40. Earlier in the day, Sports Direct issued a trading update for the first half and revealed that House of Fraser had lost £31.5m in the first 11 weeks after the discount retailer bought it out of administration.Sports Direct also recently purchased Evans Cycles from its administrators.

They had hoped to land somewhere plain, but found it even more free of rocks and safe than they had been expecting.The near-absence of rocks, hills and holes means it\u0027ll be extremely safe for our instruments, said InSight\u0027s Principal Investigator Bruce Banerdt of NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. This might seem like a pretty plain piece of ground if it weren\u0027t on Mars, but we\u0027re glad to see that.The spacecraft appears to be sitting in some sort of hollow, a dip made in the Elysium region where it landed when a meteor landed there. That should make it easier for the probe to dig down into the surface.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms. The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places.

The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Barclays received a “D+ rating” for its environmental performance in a 2018 \u0026nbspreport from group Banking on Climate Change after it was listed as a funder of fossil fuel extraction.British Summer Time are expected to release a statement later today, but sponsorship on the remaining days of the festival will not change.The festival runs from 6-15 July and the other headliners include Florence and the Machine and Robbie Williams.Neil Young and Bob Dylan will co-headline the festival on July 12.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

We believe a key element of local engagement has been ongoing work with the communities in which we drive, including Arizona law enforcement and first responders.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So, it\u0027s not impossible.Jeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027After the apocalypse, all that will be left will be ants and Tory MPs complaining about Europe and their leader.\u0026nbspHe was posting his stark message in response to a clip of Mr Rees-Mogg telling Newsnight the vote was much worse than the prime minister thought, adding an overwhelming majority of backbenchers have voted against her.Former cabinet minister Nicky Morgan, who supported the prime minister, even suggested the party may split, telling the BBC on Thursday: I think there\u0027s an inevitability that some of these people - the hardest Brexiteers - are going to walk.\u0026nbspThere may be some sort of reconfiguration of parties on the right of the UK political spectrum and that may be something we are going to have to accept in order to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons.Brexiteers also took to the airwaves after the vote of no confidence, hitting out at the chancellor Philip Hammond, who described the wing of the party as extremists during Wednesday\u0027s febrile atmosphere.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Former party leader Iain Duncan Smith - whose Commons office was reportedly used as an HQ by rebel Tories during Wednesday\u0027s voting - told the Chancellor to moderate your language.I have one simple message for the Chancellor: When you start turning on your own party and making accusations about them, that\u0027s the beginning of the end for your party, Mr Duncan Smith told Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.One of Mr Hammond\u0027s Cabinet colleagues, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, distanced himself from the comment, telling Today: I think all of us say sometimes things in interviews which we perhaps could have phrased in a better way. It\u0027s not the phraseology I would have used.Both Mr Duncan Smith and Mr Rees-Mogg denied reports that the rebels had nicknamed their Commons base for the vote the kill zone, with the ERG chair claiming the deeply disagreeable moniker was invented by May supporters in the hope of discrediting them.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

She also pledged to leave office before the 2022 general election – essentially starting the clock on the next Tory leadership contest.Asked whether she had a date in mind for leaving office, the PM said: “No, people try to talk about dates. What I’m clear about is the next general election is in 2022 and I think it’s right that another party leader takes us into that general election.”Ms May met with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar\u0026nbspthis morning, which he described as very long, and is also having bilateral\u0026nbspdiscussions with Luxembourgish PM Xavier Bettel and European Council president Donald Tusk.She will try to convince EU leaders of the need to grant her concessions at a rare 28-way back-and-forth session this afternoon. After dinner the leaders will decide amongst themselves without Ms May what to offer her – they are expected to offer a written statement.Minister likens Brexiteers to \u0027ants\u0027 as Tory isions exposedJeremy Corbyn accuses May of presiding over \u0027government in chaos\u0027What next for Brexit after May’s no-confidence vote?May wins vote of confidence from Tory MPs, thwarting Brexiteer rebelsArriving at the summit the other European leaders tempered expectations but said they were willing to help.Juha Sipila, the Finnish prime minister told reporters that it would be “a little bit difficult” to give the PM legally binding assurances but that leaders wanted to try and help anyway.“Legally binding will be a little bit difficult, but anyway, I think that we all want to help. First of all, our goal is that the new relationship will be made before the backstop,” he said.\u0026nbsp“So I think at the political level we can say it again that that’s our primary call. Let’s see if we can find something from the legal side also, but it’s open still.“This question is very important for all of us and we have to have some kind of solution in case there is no deal for the future relationship. This is the reason why this backstop is there but of course our primary goal is to find a solution for the new relationship also, so that we don’t need any backstops.”Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz said: ”We are ready to accommodate Theresa May. It’s not about pushing through maximum positions but to find a provision that is the best possible for both sides.”Created with Sketch.

More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin\u0027s suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin\u0027s New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk\u0027s SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen\u0027s Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company\u0027s first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos\u0027 New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth\u0027s atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin\u0027s Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin\u0027s pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA\u0027s definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday\u0027s test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government was rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who were treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here. Some lost jobs, were denied healthcare or were threatened with deportation.Mr Javid said his family could easily have been caught up in the same situation after moving to the UK half a century ago.He told The Sunday : “I thought that could be my mum, my dad, my uncle ...it could be me.”He added: “I was really concerned when I first started hearing and reading about some of the issues.It immediately impacted me. I’m a second-generation migrant. My parents came to this country from Pakistan, just like the Windrush generation.”His comments heaped more pressure on Ms Rudd, but he also defended the government, urging people to look at the bigger picture and his colleagues efforts to put things right.After being made Home Secretary he said his most urgent task is sorting out the Windrush mess and his immigration policy will be fair and will treat people with respect and decency.The Sun revealed how Mr Javid grew up on Britain’s most crime-ridden street, which led to his brother Bas Javid joining the police.Bas is now a chief superintendent in the West Mids Police Force, and his brother drew on the coppers  years of force experience in his first major speech.Describing his shock at the abuse he saw hurled at his brother as he tried to work, Sajid said: Over the years, I’ve heard what he has to say about policing.I know the tricky situations he’s been in. He’s been hurt more times than I want to know from being assaulted on duty.I’ve seen the impact the job has on his family le."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000402655327-e1528307444665.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"what brexit backstop plan theresa may eu irish border latest","story":"Here is our guide to the plan and what it means for Northern Ireland and its border with the Republic of Ireland.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.It is unclearthe UK would be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries while the backstop endured.On November , EU leaders approved an agreement on the UKs withdrawal from the EU.MPs were due to vote on the deal in parliament today, but yesterday the PM announced she was delaying the vote.There was a three-hour long debate in the house of commons yesterday during which May was asked many questions about what will happen with the Irish border.She will attempt to reopen negotiations with Brussels about the Irish border backstop, however they have said negotiations are now closed.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been ordered to publish all the legal advice hes given Mrs May on her proposed deal - but has only handed over a summary instead.It concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document.After the refusal to publish the full legal advice, the government were found to be in contempt of Parliament on December  for the first time in history.Theresa May lost a crucial Commons vote by  to  over her refusal to publish the full legal advice on her EU deal.Conceding defeat moments after the vote, Commons leader Andrea Leadsom agreed to publish the “final and full” legal advice that Mr Cox gave to the Cabinet as they deliberated the EU deal.A motion tabled by Labour, the SNP, other opposition parties and the DUP, argued ministers were in contempt due to their failure to fully publish advice given to Cabinet by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.Addressing the issue of the backstop - which will keep Britain in the customs uniontheres no other way to protect the Irish border - the Attorney General said: There is no unilateral right for either party to terminate this arrangement.This means thatno superseding agreement can be reached within the implementation period, the protocol would be activated and in international law would subsist, evennegotiations had broken down.How likely that is to happen is a political question, to which the answer will no doubt depend partly on the extent to which it is in either partys interests to remain indefinitely within its arrangements.We are indefinitely committing to itit came into force. There is no point in the Government trying to hide that fact.The Democratic Unionist Party has vowed to oppose any new checks on goods passing between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Irelands Foreign Minister, Simon Coveney, said that EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier indicated that the European Union will allow extra time for talks about the border.Mr Coveney said he was frustrated and disappointed that it was going to take more time than people had hoped.At the start of a key debate in Parliament on her Brexit plan, the Prime Minister said the backstop was not a trap for Britain.The backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU, said Mrs May.It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EUs market without many of the obligations and that is something the EU will not want to let happen, let alone persist for a long time.The unpopular backstop measure may have been once of the contributors to a vote of no confidence which left Theresa May facing a leadership challenge on December .After winning the vote of no confidence, May has gone back to Brussels to beg for a better Brexit deal.She has agreed that she needs to amend the backstop and will attempt to do that in the coming days.Former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab have also unveiled their own alternative Brexit plan, which includes scrapping the Northern Irish backstop altogether.They would instead try to replace it with a ten-year extendable agreement involving free trade in goods, no tarfs and technology-based border control."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000421388248.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jeremy corbyn as pm country faces ruin","story":"No doubt she will take one of her long walks as she prepares to face the toughest week of her political le.But on her trek around the gardens one thing should focus her mind above all others.The prospect of Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street within weeks.Of all the outcomes of the Brexit fiasco, the most disastrous by far would be ushering into Number  a man who would do untold damage to Britain.It seems almost inevitable that MPs will throw out the PM’s woeful plan on Tuesday, possibly by a majority of more than .That is not just defeat. It is catastrophic defeat.The PM could immediately face a vote of no confidence triggered by power-hungry Labour.The Parliamentary arithmetic means that she could narrowly lose this vote — evenshe manages to win the support of every MP on the Conservative benches behind her.It would raise the terrying prospect of Corbyn and his rag-tag band of half-baked Marxists in Downing Street.Not only will Corbyn fritter away the country’s hard-won economic and social progress but he will also pursue policies which are a disgraceful betrayal of Brexit and millions of his own voters.In the face of the dismaying scenario before her, the PM has no choice but to postpone Tuesday’s crucial vote on her deal.It will be dficult and humiliating.But it will give her vital breathing space at Thursday’s EU summit to address the grievous concerns over her backstop proposal.Even the most blinkered of Brussels Eurocrats, whose intransigence so far has led to this crisis, must realise that such a concession is as much in their interests as ours.Mrs May has often stressed her determination to act in the national interest.Does she really think it is best for this country to press on with a vote which could hand victory to Jeremy Corbyn Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He strode towards me and pushed me out of his way.“I fell and fractured my ankle.”The teenager, who is studying to become a hairdresser, had to have a screw drilled into her ankle during a two-day hospital stay.Five weeks after the November  ordeal, she still requires the use of crutches and wears a special protective boot.Rachel Brown, , had gone to pick a friend up at Sandbach train station in April when her car was surrounded by dozens of teens.Speaking to the Sun Online, the mum said: “They surrounded the car and proceeded to jump up and down on the bonnet.“They weren’t aggressive to begin with, they were normal teenagers that were hyped up and wanted to be known.“But then it got to be a bit more – I opened my car door to try to get them to leave and they started taking stuff out of my car.”Rachel said the youths also started mocking her Scottish accent, and licking her car windows as the incident escalated.She said: “It quickly changed – one of them said - oh  you’re an f***ing slag, go die in a fire.“It went from being sort of funny to quite dark really  fast.”Eventually, the gang left with Rachel reporting it straight away to police.She said: “I was intimidated but I was thinking more along the lines, they have run off and they are looking for trouble, that’s why I reported it.”Police responded straight away, taking forensic swabs of her car and pulling CCTV of the area.But the abuse worsened after Rachel spoke to police, with the Congleton local receiving threats online, including from -year-old Jayden Burdern.The message read: “Oi why’ve u sed I’ve smashed ur car n got me court.“Best drop da charges”.And in another message, a pal wrote: “Oi u slag.“Drop the charges wid burden and ik where u live sou don’t drop em I’ll blast ur t*t off.“And your houses.”Jayden Burden, , pleaded guilty in court this week to witness intimidation for sending electronic messages.A British Transport Police said they had investigated the incident of anti-social behaviour at Sandbach station on April .They added: “A number of enquiries were made into the incident, however the Crown Prosecution Service later decided not to continue with court proceedings.”Another -year-old caught up in the carnage was knocked out outside a takeaway on the same night.She was left with concussion and whiplash after being kicked.Her mum said: “They started shouting stuff and she told them to leave her friends alone.“She was knocked to the floor and kicked.“Nothing like this has happened before.Cheshire Police believe the Crewe gang were behind both terrying incidents.That some locals vowed to take the law into their own hands over a lack of visible policing, with fears more than a dozen other teens are yet to be brought to book.Pub owner Shaun Radclfe, , called for a public meeting with cops over the disorder.He said: “It all started about two months ago.“A group were coming down to Congleton and causing havoc in the town centre.“They had been banned from Crewe, so they went to Sandbach and were quickly moved on by the police.“So they ended up in Congleton. The police were never around so they kept getting away with it.“Everyone was so angry - there were messages on social media where people were threatening to take the law into their own hands.I didnt want my -year-old daughter to go out at night.“Thankfully the police have bucked their ideas up and arrests have been made.Dog walkers at pretty Congleton Park told how the area had become a no-go zone at night because of the trouble.Police have linked two attacks in the park to the Crewe invasion. One attack was said to have been on a teenage boy near to the town’s leisure centre.Other incidents being probed by police include disorder when several youths were trying to board a the  bus from Congleton to Crewe.Arriva Buses has passed CCTV footage to cops.A pensioner told Sun Online he was fearful of being in the town centre.The -year-old, who did not want to be named, said: “They’re coming to cause trouble.“It makes you think twice about coming to town - especially with it going dark so soon.”Congleton kids, meanwhile, have come in for praise after replanting flowers and tidying up the mess left by the yobs.Mr Radclfe, who saw more than  people attend his public forum with police, added “It’s not something you see in Congleton and, to be fair, some of our kids have helped tidy up the mess they’ve left behind.“This is a nice little town and we don’t need this. Kids shouldn’t be told to stay indoors because there’s a chance they might be beaten up.”Three teens - Jayden Burdern, , Riley Gaffney, , and -year-old Reigan Gaffney, , from Crewe, were this week hit with criminal behaviour orders.It is not known whether the teenagers were directly involved in any of the incidents described.At the Crewe home of Jayden today, rope was tied around a front gate.A man yelled: “F*** off, f*** off” loud enough to hear through closed double-glazed windows.There was no answer at the home of the Gaffney brothers, who live with their gran, Jeannette, a parcel delivery worker.IT used to be a quiet town full of pensioners and families settling down.Almost half the population are over , with .% aged  or older according to the Census data.But the tranquil town had its serenity shattered with the arrival of violent yobs bent on chaos.Before then, the country of Cheshire - to which Congleton belongs - had less crime than the nations average.It had some of the lowest figures in the country for kne crime, vehicle crime and burglary, according to police stats.It even won three gold medals at Britain in Bloom for its beautul bouquets. Councillor Janet Clowes, Cheshire East Council cabinet member for adult social care and integration, said: “These young people’s behaviour impacted on members of the public and we had no alternative but to seek these Criminal Behaviour Orders alongside custodial sentencing for those that continue to persist with their offending.“We hope the orders assist these young people by giving them the boundaries they need to improve their behaviour.“In the case of a young person, taking a criminal case is always a last resort and our officers both within Cheshire Constabulary and Cheshire East Council have spent a considerable amount of time over several years to support everyone involved.“However, there has to be a point at which we say, enough is enough, our residents have the right to live in peace and without fear and we must protect them from iniduals who don’t respect this.We know it can be dficult but we would urge people to report anti-social behaviour to us.”Sergeant Andy Baker, from the Crewe Beat Team, added: “The behaviour of this group of youths was totally unacceptable and I welcome the punishments that they have been given.“We will continue to work closely with our partners to take robust action against those who persistently cause misery to members of our community with this kind of behaviour.”Last month we told how up to  teenage yobs were terrorising another town -  miles away.Residents in Stanley, County Durham told how gangs of kids as young as ten were attacking cops with fireworks and bricks and pelting locals with eggs."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000454843309.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"gran claims princess dianas secret aunt prince harry","story":"Ann Ukrainetz, , says she is the illegitimate daughter of Maurice Roche - Dianas granddad.The gran-of-seven grew up thinking she was the child of timber foreman Charles Rudderforth - but says she discovered the truth in .She claimed to have found a series of love notes between Evelyn and Maurice tucked inside an old music programme.One note - purportedly from Maurice, th Baron Fermoy - says: I am so sorry the birth of our Ann caused you so much pain.

The clay pot contained copper plates, tin alloy, and an iron rod.It could have been used to create an electric current by filling it with an acidic solution, like vinegar.No one knows what the device was used for, but it sheds some light on the fact that people may have been learning about electricity long before Humphry Davy invented the first electric light in ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000455951740.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may vows to carry on","story":"The PM set the clock ticking on the end of her Premiership as she addressed all Tory MPs last night.Minutes later, they decided to give her more time in No in a dramatic snap confidence vote on her rocking leadership.But Mrs May took a heavy blow, as  Tories refused to back her versus  who did – a majority of , or % of her troops.Her bitter critics seized on the deep split to insist she would step much within weeks, rather than serving up to three more years.In an attempt to ease the tidal wave of anger against her handling of Brexit, the PM revealed she was giving up her burning ambition to right the wrong of last year when she threw away the Tories’ Commons majority.She told a packed Commons committee room: “Look in my heart, I would have liked to lead the Party in the next election, partly because of what happened last time.“But I realise that the party would like a dferent leader to take them into that election.”Instead, she insisted the question they were voting on in her leadership “for now” to get the nation through Brexit, as one minister said she also told the room it was “no time for navel gazing”.At the same time, the PM insisted she was “listening to colleagues and acting on their concerns” as she said she was doing her “very best” to plot away through the myriad of dferent Brexit views that Parliament has.During testy exchanges during the showdown meeting, angry hardline Brexiteer criti hauled her over the coals.One MP, Lee Rowley, told Mrs May witheringly: “Stamina is not a policy, Prime Minister”.Mrs May was also grilled on what further concessions she had wrung out of Brussels, and whether she really was prepared to walk away without a deal – a question she pointedly ducked.One critic in the room said she was clearly nervous, and started her pm address with the gaffe “good morning colleagues”, and her answers were “evasive”.But loyalists banged the giant committee room’s desks and doors loudly in support, with pro-May Tory grandee Sir Nicholas Soames dubbing her “magnicent”.The shock confidence vote in her Tory leadership was declared at .am yesterday by Tory backbenchers’  Committee boss Sir Graham Brady.He revealed the threshold for it of  letters had finally been reached, having hovered on around  for weeks but surged in the last few days from MPs irate that Mrs May pulled a doomed vote on her Brexit deal on Monday.Sir Graham phoned Mrs May at pm on Tuesday evening to break the dramatic news to her.Reacting with a powerful statement on No’s steps before am, Mrs May vowed to fight bid to topple her “with everything I have got”.Ousting her would mean Britain’s EU exit date would have to be delayed for months by whoever succeeded her, the PM warned.And she had insisted: “Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart would only create more ision”.The leadership crisis erupted ahead of crucial EU summit in Brussels today, during which Mrs May will plea for better terms on the hated Irish back stop element of her Brexit deal.The PM was also forced to rip up a trip to Dublin yesterday afternoon to hold key talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar.Every member of the Cabinet immediately rushed out messages of support and their backing for Mrs May, along with most of her  ministers.Long standing eurosceptic Ian Liddell-Grainger gave an early inkling that the PM would win out among the  or so waverers, saying early yesterday afternoon: “I thought about this long and hard. We can’t change horses in the middle of the race”But other MPs sat on the fence and said they would wait to hear what the PM had to day to them.Backbencher Michael Fabricant said he wanted to hear from Mrs May that she has found “a solution or an alternative way forward”.After Mrs May addressed her MPs at pm last night, an emotional Home Office Minister Victoria Atkins welled up as she told reporters of the PM’s decision to step down, saying: “It was an emotional moment”.But her critics questioned her pledge to step down before , after she ducked follow up questions to name a hard date when she would go.Brexiteer rebel leader Jacob Rees Mogg also insisted she had left key wriggle room in her promise, saying: “She recognised the party doesn’t want her so it wasn’t her intention to stand.“But intentions can change.”The PM was seen to have been bolstered earlier by a strong performance at PMQs, after even Labour MPs admitted she had trounced Jeremy Corbyn.Tory grandee and at bitter critic Ken Clarke – who once dubbed her “a bloody dficult woman – rose to tell the chamber during the session that a leadership contest now was “unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible”.Mrs May’s husband Philip made a rare appearance in the public gallery to watch her, with a No aide saying he wanted to give her “emotional support”.Charlie Elphicke, , was quizzed by cops earlier this year over “serious allegations”.And Andrew Grfiths, , still faces a party probe for bombarding two young women with lewd text messages.The married dad quit as small business minister in July after it was revealed he sent , messages in  days soon after his first child’s birth.The pair were expected to cancel each other out. Mr Grfiths, the PM’s former chief of staff, said he would back Mrs May while Mr Elphicke was expected to oppose her.But their reinstatement sparked fury. Labour MP Dawn Butler said: “How can Theresa May call herself a feminist when she lets an MP who was suspended for sexual harassment back into the Conservative Party to vote for her in the leadership challenge ”Fellow Labour MP Jess Phillips added: “They said, ‘We won’t let patronage and power change our minds where wrongdoing occurred’. They lied. They all lied.”As the two hour-long secret ballot opened last night, a total of  Tory MPs had declared their public support for Mrs May.Just  had said they would vote against her.Other prominent critics of the PM, including ex-Cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson, refused to say how they had voted.But amid high skull-duggery, several MPs were claimed to have pledged their support to BOTH camps.Loyal Tories were last night tweeting snaps of their ballot paper, with one – business minister Margot James – saying she was “proud to have voted in support of the PM”.Several Tory MPs reported to have been inundated with messages from party members and normal constituents for them to back Mrs May.MPs filed into Committee Room  to place their vote, after being asked to show their photographic ID passes.Officials from the  Committee, the backbench body that represents all Tory MPs, checked off their names from a list and handed them a numbered ballot paper.On it was with the simple question “I have confidence in Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party   I do not have confidence in Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party”.The Prime Minister placed her vote at .pm.Asked by reporters how she’d voted she laughed before heading out with security officers.Former Brexit Secretary David Davis moaned as he left the room that officials didn’t know who he was and “wanted to see my bloody pass”.THERESA May had to lap Parliament Square ahead of Prime Minister’s Questions after the gates did not open.Her convoy directed her bomb-proof armoured Jaguar XJL to do a loop of Parliament Square before police on Carriage Gates eventually opened the doors.Twitter users had joked that it was “a bit early for a victory lap” ahead of the vote.It was her second car gaffe after she was locked in her limo before meeting Angela Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday.Her embarrassed security staff battled for  seconds to open the PM’s door.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I kept thinking ‘Ive won’ - things like this never happen to me.“The first thing I thought was – ‘I can be mortgage free. I could pay off the mortgage and give some money to my kids’.”But Angela’s dreams were shattered when she excitedly rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working.“Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadn’t scratchedoff properly.“If I had scratched off any more the card would have been wrecked.”Camelot told Angela one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E - not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up.It comes after dad-of-four Eric was also denied a £k payout on his card - after being accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.Unemployed Eric, who buys six scratchcards a day, believes there was a misprint on the scratchcard after he matched three symbols.He has now invited cops to his home to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated.Similarly, Angela believes Camelot is keeping her cash because it wants to avoid a mass pay out in case there is a widespread fault with the cards.The mum-of-two said: “When I spoke to Camelot they said this had never happened before.“I told them ‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’.“It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.”The game offers five top prizes of £, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols.Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and refuted claims of a faulty batch.A spokesperson said today: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims.We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket.If we believe that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery, then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.”Angela has refused to give up on her claim and wants others to be aware of the alleged “faulty cards in case they miss out on their own fortune.She said: At first I took Camelot’s word for it, but now I’ve seen its happened to someone .“I don’t think it’s right. My le could have been completely changed.“I feel like I’ve been cheated.“When I scratched the card I didn’t think it was real. But you start to believe.“For Camelot to turn around and say no, it feels like they’ve ripped that dream away.“It’s a huge conglomerate against one person. What hope in hell do you have ”Both Angela and Eric now argue they should receive the £k bounty.She said: “It’s funny that now two faulty cards have come to light within a few days of each other.It can’t just be us two.

you need to know...As far as the EU is concerned, Northern Ireland is part of the UK.If Britain is left with no-deal after the Brexit deadline passes, Northern Ireland is in the same boat.The Republic of Irelandare part of the EU in their own right as a sovereign nation.SoNorthern Ireland fell back on WTO rules, a new customs barrier would suddenly spring up across the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.This creates a big issue.The Good Friday Agreement dictates that people and trade must flow freely between Northern and the Republic of Ireland.A no-deal would break that agreement, and there would suddenly be a more palpable ision between the north and south.The Good Friday Agreement was instrumental in ending the violence in Ireland between southern Nationalists, and northern Unionists.There are some that fear a customs check could reignite violence as the choice of remaining part of the UK becomes more isive once again.How a Brexit deal would accommodate the Good Friday Agreement is a big issue, with a proposed back stop measure.The backstop plan is essentially a safety netthere is no Brexit trade deal.It would avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop will see Britain remain in the customs union for as long as necessary until an alternative way of keeping the border open is found.It would ensure that no tarfs, quotas, rules of origin or customs processes would be applied to UK-EU trade.At the same time the UK would supposedly be able to strike free trade agreements with other countries.However - legal advice provided to the Prime Minister by Attorney General Geoffrey Cox concluded the proposed backstop would stop Britain making trade deals around the world in a separate legal document. Our

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

I always say Conservatives. Tories doing accents seldom goes well. David Cameron used to do them all the time and each attempt was a bigger disaster than the last.

The then-Prime Minister was speaking at the annual conference of the Scottish Conservative Party .He was reminiscing about a previous visit to Edinburghs Murrayfield Stadium, hosting todays conference. It was  and hed just left the ground after watching Englands rugby team get a thrashing at the hands of Scotland in the  Nations.

He was, presumably aiming for Scotland, but missed and ended up somewhere in North Yorkshire, but posher.At the  Tory Conference, he attempted an impression of William Hague , which ended up sounding very similar to his Scottish accent."},{"url":null,"title":"woman perfectly sums up how","story":"NewsThis woman perfectly sums up how everyone feels about British politics this weekAn unnamed lady has given her verdict on Theresa May keeping her job as Prime MinisterShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video woman-southampton-perfectly-sums-up-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman from Southampton has perfectly summed up how people feel about British politics this week.

Helen Spilsbury, , says that she first noticed an itch on her son Jack on Sunday evening and thought it was a heat rash. But by Monday the Manchester schoolboy was covered with it and was scratching all over his body. Manchester Evening News reports that after a visit to the chemist, staff initially thought the eight-year-old might have hand, food and mouth disease However a trip to see the doctor on Tuesday confirmed that Jack had measles - and it was the worst case he had ever seen. Helen was shocked because Jack has had both MMR jabs when he was younger - giving protection against measles, mumps and rubella.  She said: Even at the doctors the nurse first thought it could be either hand, foot and mouth or slap cheek as theyd seen recent cases. After looking a bit more they realised it was measles and the doctor said it was the worst case hes seen. She added: When they first said it looks like measles I just thought it cant be. I was really surprised because hes had both jabs against it. Helen, who works at Aldi in Clayton but is off sick with sciatica, called her sons school, Holden Clough Primary in Ashton, to warn them about the case and has told anyone that Jack had been in recent contact with. Theyve been told to avoid contact with people for seven to  days. She said: Jack seems OK really apart from his rash. Hes got a bit of the snfles and a cough and a little lump on the back of his ears, which are really hot, but apparently thats all part of the illness. We just hope it doesnt spread to anyone . Theres me and my husband Stuart in the house and also my -year-old dad Ron so were trying to keep Jack away from him as much as we can.  Public Health England warns that measles is a very infectious virus and can spread rapidly among communities, such as schools,people have not been fully immunised. A spokesman said theres no evidence to suggest measles is circulating in Greater Manchester and said that when GPs noty them of a suspected case, a swab kit is issued and laboratory testing is arranged. Manchester GP Dr Usman Choudry, GTD Healthcare’s urgent care clinical lead, warned parents that although many children have been immunised, there is still a small chance that they can contract the virus. He said: “Its extremely unlikely to get measles after two doses of MMR immunisation. Having both jabs is believed to give up to % protection so there is a very small chance of getting measles but the immunisations give considerable protection.” Measles begins with fever that lasts for a couple of days followed by a cough, runny nose and conjunctivitis . The rash starts on the face and upper neck, spreads down the upper body and then extends to the arms, hands, legs and feet. After about five days the rash starts to fade. An unpleasant illness and easily passed from one person to another, in some people it can cause complications, such as ear infection, chest infections and even pneumonia. In very rare cases some people who get measles can develop serious complications, which can be fatal. Public Health England advises people with symptoms of measles to... Stay away from school, nursery or work until five days have elapsed after the onset of a rash. Telephone your GP or NHS walk-in centre before attending so that arrangements can be made for you to be treated in a separate area to prevent spread to other vulnerable patients. Avoid contact with people generally, but particularly babies, pregnant women and anyone who is known to have poor immunity to infection.Children are offered two doses of MMR vaccine. The first dose at age  to  months and the second aged four to six.

Researchers found once the main event of Christmas dinner is over, millions of Brits begin to focus on what can be fashioned into the most decadent sandwich of the year. Thick slices of turkey are the most popular choice of filling, with a generous dollop of cranberry sauce and some salty, crispy bacon. Crispy-skinned chicken, roast ham and beef were also popular choices of meats to fill the indulgent yuletide treat. Darren Littler, innovation director at Warburtons, which commissioned the study, said: “The Christmas sandwich is a national talking point each year and it’s clear that Brits are particular when it comes to what should and should not be included. More unconventional fillings such as falafel, roasted butternut squash and avocado also appeared as top choices for the leftover sandwich connoisseur.

The parents, from Bedfont in Hounslow, fought to take Charlie to the USA for experimental treatment, after being told by doctors in London that nothing could be done to save him. But eventually their legal battle faltered and Charlie died in a hospice, at just  months old, in the company of his parents.Devastated dad Chris has opened up about Charlies legacy, trying to change the law to help other families and what it was like being in the glare of the media spotlight.Since losing Charlie on July , , he says there hasnt been a single easy day for Chris and Connie. But Chris admits Christmas can be particularly emotional. He told My London: Every day is hard, especially at this time of year. I remember when I was a kid I would be so excited for Christmas and the fact I will never see Charlie’s smiling face on Christmas morning breaks my heart. But all we can do is work on his legacy.  Chris was speaking out to raise awareness about the Charlie Gard Foundation Christmas Fayre, which takes place on Saturday December  in Bedfont.The foundation was set up in June  to work for a brighter future for other sick children and their families.Chris says the dference Charlie made in his short le continues to motivate his parents. He said: The impact that little boy had on the world - you just couldn’t make it up. That’s inspired us and that keeps us going. We were reborn when Charlie was born. One of the aims of the foundation established in Charlies name is to research ways to tackle the condition that ended his young le. Infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromeis rare and not widely known about.  Chris said: There’s not a lot of awareness about the disease - I certainly wasn’t aware of it before Charlie - so the fayre this weekend will be about raising money for research but also awareness. We hate this disease and despise it. It took Charlie from us. So we’re going to do all we can to eradicate that. One of the many things we want to support is research to hopefully find that elusive cure. However the Charlie Gard Foundation has other aims too, beyond research to tackle the disease. It is also working to support families going through ordeals similar to the one endured by Chris, Connie and Charlie. Chris added: We raised a lot of money for Charlie so we want that to go towards research but also to memory making for those children who are still here without much time left. We’ve also donated wheelchairs and hoists and things like that to help other families. The reason Charlie Gards case made the headlines was because of the legal battle between Great Ormond Street Hospital and his parents. Both fundamentally disagreed about what was best for Charlie. The tussles in the courts made things harder for Chris and Connie.  Now they want to change the law to make sure other parents avoid the same ordeal. Chris explained bringing about a so-called Charlies Law remained one of the key aims of the foundation. He said: Charlie’s Law is still very much the focus. We want to make sure families don’t have to go through this again. We’ve been speaking to senior politicians to try to change things. The process of trying to bring about change has involved Chris and Connie speaking to people who opposed them during the legal fight to save their son.  But Chris says such cooperation is necessary to make things better - for parents and doctors. He added: We’ve got together with a lot of people who disagreed with us. We’ve realised that to change things we’d have to speak to doctors, to ethicists. We want to get a law that is better for everybody. The key thing Chris wants to see is compulsory mediation in complex medical cases like Charlies, to keep disagreements out of the stressful environment of the courts. Any case that avoids going to court means a lot less heartache for people, he added. Charlies case went through the highest courts in the UK - which led to his family being at the centre of worldwide media scrutiny. US President Donald Trump and even the Pope offered their opinions on the case. But Charlies dad says all of that never really sunk in because of the relentless focus on his little boy.  Chris said: We never really realised how big it was for the outside world. We were in a bubble - all we cared about was Charlie. But it has been tough at times. We knew when we went to the media in the first place that we needed the money for Charlie but we could ide opinion and upset a few people. That said, the majority of people I speak to say they think Charlie deserved a chance. No one thinks we were bad parents. Support from the familys west London community - where the Christmas fayre for the foundation will take place on December  - was a welcome tonic to all the attention. Chris said: The community have been fantastic. We both lost our faith in humanity a little bit during the battle to save Charlie. But the support we’ve had has been phenomenal. Ultimately Chris and Connie fought for hope - hope that their son could survive,they gave an alternative option a try. And the dad remains determined to keep campaigning for more research and more sensible laws - in order to give that hope to other families. Chris said: You cannot deny how much power there is in hope. We felt hopeless at times but without hope what are we  If we can give other families some hope we’d have done Charlie proud. The power of hope and love is certainly something worth remembering at Christmas. If you want to support the Charlie Gard Foundation you can attend the event in Bedfont on December  or visit the charitys website.

Unemployed doorman Eric Walker, , claims he won the money on a pound Pharoahs Fortune card three weeks ago but Camelot refused to pay up. Lottery organisers yesterday confirmed police had been called and were dealing with the incident. But Mr Walker said cops can do what they want and he wont back down because it would take an expert to doctor a scratchcard. The dad-of-four told Sun Online: I have nothing to hide because I havent done anything wrong, I know the card hasnt been tampered with. The police can show me how the card has been altered because I cant see it. They can do what they want. I dont have the skills to fake a scratchcard, youd have to be some sort of expert to pull that off.   Mr Walker yesterday said he has been left traumatised by Camelots decision. That scratchcard has not been doctored. Im not that bright to be honest with you, he told The Mirror on Wednesday. The dad-of-four claims he should have been facing a fantastic Christmas but instead fears he could end up having a heart attack because of all the stress. Mr Walker contacted Camelot in November after scratching three matching symbols on the National Lotterys pound a time Pharoahs Fortune card. On the scratchcard sixteen co-ordinates are given, which are used to scratch off the corresponding squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharoah symbols. But lottery organisers Camelot said they have investigated and it was a non-winning Scratchcard.   They refused to pay up saying that one of the co-ordinates on the card was altered as winning co-ordinate F appears to have been changed to an E. But Mr Walker denies the scratchcard was doctored and says it must be the result of a misprint. He explained how his partner Amanda Emmadi, , scratched the card off to reveal three winning pharoahs. She was staring at the ticket for two hours, she was traumatised because she couldnt believe what was happening in front of her, he said. I had to pull the card out of her hand and then saw the same thing and she was seeing. Its a winner. However, within hours, he said Camelot had put a dampener on their joy.   Mr Walker insisted: I can assure you nobody has altered it and nobody has tampered with it. That cards been put away and is still put away. I wont even let my girlfriend touch it, I know its her card and everything. When asked why the scratchcard appears dferent in two pictures, one taken by Eric and the other by a photographer, he told The Mirror: I understand what youre saying..it does look dferent. But nobody has done anything to that card. Asked about why so many squares had been scratched off, he said: There are two more now that have been scratched off. When Camelot says it wasnt E, it was F, we scratched F off. And when asked why the random E had been scratched off he said: I dont know why. I will have to go back and have a look at the card. A Camelot spokesman yesterday confirmed that an investigation had been launched and it was found that a co-ordinate had been altered. But Mr Walker is refusing to back down and says that the money would be le changing for him and his partner.   He said: How can they investigate when they havent seen the card themselves. They can come here to look at it because Im not posting it or letting it out of my sight. Mr Walker, who buys six scratchcards a day, has children aged between  months and nine-years-old. He said: In my eyes Ive won pound, and Im being cheated out of the money. I havent doctored it, Im not trying to cheat. Im no angel but I wouldnt cheat.” He still insists he won the jackpot fair and square adding: If its a misprint then thats their fault and they should still pay out, its nothing to do with me. Mr Walker bought the scratchcard from a Premier corner shop near his house three weeks ago. A Camelot spokesperson said they were contacted through their general enquiries email address and it was not escalated to their prize claims team as there was no claim to be dealt with. They said: We were able to re-construct the Scratchcard in our system. We can confirm that an F has been altered to appear as an E, and is therefore not a winning Scratchcard.

EmailAn Essex football stadium has been put up for sale and it could be yours to buy - but it will cost you. The former home of Thurrock FC is on the market after chairman Tommy South failed to find a new owner since announcing he was stepping down last year. But Essex Live reports that a potential buyer would need to stump up a lot of money for the stadium, which is on the market for just under poundmillion. Mr South founded Essex Sports Football Club which became Purfleet FCin April  and the club enjoyed a meteoric rise through the non-league pyramid. Then in  the club changed its name to Thurrock FC and becamefounder members of the Conference South, the second tier in the game outside the Football League. The club played its final competitive fixture at the conclusion of the   season.   Buyers will be able to lace up their boots in the dressing room and play on the hallowed turf before relaxing with a drink or two in the clubhouse. The main pitch is surrounded on all four sides by terraced stands, with some seating on three sides. Included in any proposed sale is the clubhouse, a stadium catering outlet and a merchandise shop. The whole lot, located off junction  of the M, is up for sale. A further two football pitches are located to the north of the main pitch, which are used as training facilities and playing fields.   The Thurrock Hotel, consisting of a four-to-five storey building, with parking, sits at the southern boundary of the site. The site is separated into three main areas: Thurrock Football Club, which is . acres in size, the training pitches, which are . acres and the buffer zone, measuring . acres.

Kate Middleton headed through the palace gates in a Range Rover, raising a hand to wave at onlookers as she passed by. But what was really interesting about the moment, was that Kate, , was seen driving herself to the home of her grandmother-in-law, The Queen. This is because members of the royal family are very rarely seen out and about driving their own cars, and instead are often chauffeured to official engagements. However royal etiquette expert, William Hanson, recently told The Express that modern royalty tend to drive themselves to private parties and events.So its very likely that Kate was just dropping by for a casual visit.And according to HELLO! the Duchess often visits Buckingham to use the Queens swimming pool, which is where her children have been learning how to swim.The publication went on to suggest that her children, Princess Charlotte and baby Prince Louis may have been accompanying her on the visit, as the cars rear windows were blacked-out. Footage of the mum-of-three behind the wheel was shared on Instagram by a user called melissagrflx, who was out exploring London for the day.She shared it along with several shots of herself and captioned the post: At Buckingham Palace. When youre so lucky to get a shot of Kate Middleton right when she gets to the palace. So far over  people have liked her clip. In the video, Kate looks stunning as ever, dressed in a cream top, with her long dark hair down.  This isnt the first time this year a member of the Royal Family has hit the headlines because of a car. Back in September Meghan Markle sent royal fans into a frenzy when she was filmed closing her own car door - something The Queen never does. The Duchess of Sussex was attending her first solo engagement at the time - the opening of the Oceania exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts. People on social media were quick to praise Meghan for doing something so normal. One person said: A princess who still takes the time to shut her car door. Well done Meghan! Another commented: I don’t think Meghan Markle sees herself as better than anyone . She knows that she and Prince Harry are blessed to have found each other. I’m proud of her. Le is good.

Have you experienced a petty crime in London  Click to tell us your story. , the NYT enquired, hopefully. As the citys level of violent crime rises, help us understand how the London police are responding to minor property crimes, the plea continued. This was clearly never going to go to plan. We Brits love a laugh, and are in dire need of one at the moment. NYT was inundated with not-so-serious examples of petty crime - and there are some brilliant responses.   One wrote: pound for a pint. Daylight robbery! Another said: I once had to travel on the Central Line in the summer. My case will appear before the European Court of Human Rights some time next year. A third: estate agent made me pay pound, for my tiny zone  flat. Aside from plenty of nods to expensive pints, the dreaded tube and pricey houses, others played up stereotypes of Brits in their funny responses.Someone held the door open for me when I was still ten feet away and then I had to run and pretend I was grateful. I was sweaty and fuming, a Twitter user said.   I said after you to a woman entering a cafe and instead of saying no no please, my good lady I insist, after YOU she went in, ordered exactly what I was going to order for lunch, and got the last one. I almost tutted but I am not an animal, someone  posted. Putting this question to a sarcastic bunch of Brits on social media wasnt the newspapers only blunder, as it also made a serious one. The current image in the tweet shows London police lining up, which makes sense given their request to understand what the Met are up to when it comes to minor property crime. But this wasnt always the case.   The tweet originally displayed an image of flowers being laid in the street, which was actually a tribute made in Hackney for Israel Ogunsola, a teenager who was tragically stabbed to death on April . This is not an example of Londons petty crime. Neither the New York Times nor the journalist who made the appeal have so far responded to the overwhelming number of case studies they have received.How many make it into the final report remains to be seen.

Just two weeks ago Reece Probert was told he had six months to live when doctors found he was suffering from an inoperable brain tumour. Reece seemed perfectly healthy just last month, but his mum Jenna, , took him to the doctors when he suddenly developed a limp and then a slur, reports BirminghamLive. Scans revealed that the schoolboy had a rare aggressive brain tumour with a prognosis of between six to  months after diagnosis. His devastated family are rallying around to give him the best Christmas ever. Jenna from Wombourne, south Staffordshire, said: It will be our last Christmas together and we want to make sure its nice and comfortable and cosy for Reece.   I want to make him feel like a king. He should feel like the most important person in the world. It will be emotional because it will be his last Christmas. We will decorate the whole house and make it look like Santas grotto. It will be the most memorable Christmas ever. Reece knows he has cancer but doesnt know the reality of it. I cant face telling him. I just need him to be happy. Christmas will be a family day and we will give him anything he wants. We will just cherish it together as a family.   Just six weeks ago Reece was fit and healthy, but after ing from a trip to see his grandparents in Northern Ireland in November his mum noticed unusual symptoms. He had a limp and a sore hand, so his GP sent him to AE for an x-ray, and for tests on his tendons. But Jenna really began to worry when Reece began to slur his words two weeks ago. A neighbour - who had been diagnosed a benign brain tumour - noticed Reece struggling to speak and feared the worst, having suffered similar symptoms in the past. Personal trainer Jenna phoned  and was advised to take Reece to the Russells Hall Hospital, in Dudley, where doctors initially thought he had suffered a stroke.   But on December , when doctors at Birmingham Childrens Hospital performed a CT scan and found an abnormality the the brain. Two days later Jenna was told her son had dfuse intrinsic pontine glioma - an aggressive cancer typically found in children. She said: I collapsed when I was told that. I felt like my heart had been ripped out. It was a horrible feeling. They put him on steroids to reduce the swelling before he had the MRI scan.   It was bad enough being told he had a stroke. I was just praying that they had got it all wrong. I just started screaming no, no, no. I couldnt breathe. Its the worst thing any mum can be told. Even the oncologist has tears in her eyes whilst she was telling me. We were taken into the family room and told that chemotherapy wont work and radiotherapy will only shrink the tumour. But it will come back and will eventually end his le. Most children die between six and  months from diagnosis.   Reece is due to start his first round of radiotherapy to reduce the size of the tumour and give him more time. Jenna is now focused on making sure Reece has the most amazing Christmas with her, partner Robert Perry, , and his sister Trinity Alcock, six. Tearful Jenna said: Ive had to put the reality of it to the back of my mind. Im just focused on enjoying him whilst we still have him. We want to make memories with him and just want to make sure he is happy and comfortable.   Reece has been fantastic. He has taken it all in his stride and has been amazing. I couldnt be more proud of him. He is known as the class clown and his friends have been to visit him. For us the next year is all about making him feel extra special. Friends and family have launched fundraising campaigns and arranged charity events in a bid to raise money to ensure Reece has a Christmas to remember. So far pound, has been raised on GoFundMe.

Angela Mason has accused Camelot of cheating her out of her winnings. The -year-old purchased a Pharaohs Fortune card last month, reports The Sun, the same one which Eric Walker has been accused of manipulating. The gran, from Willenhall in the West Midlands, has a pound flutter every day and could not sleep the night she got what she thought was the winning ticket - which she planned to use to pay off her mortgage, according to the newspaper. But Angela had her dreams of a mortgage-free future dashed when she rushed to her local Post Office and was told the win could not be veried.   Florist Angela said: “At the Post Office they put in the code over and over again, but it wasn’t working. “Everyone I had showed it to said it was a winner, but I emailed Camelot and five days later they replied and said I hadnt scratchedoff properly. She claimsshe had scratched the card anymore it would have been wrecked. Camelot reportedly told the -year-old that one of her ‘winning’ grid codes was an E and not the F that she had scratched – meaning the three symbols she revealed did not match up. The revelation comes just days after it emerged that dad-of-four Mr Walker was also denied a poundk payout on his card. But he was accused of doctoring the letter F to look like an E.   He has invited the police to have a look at the ticket and says he is the one being cheated. He explained how his partner Amanda Emmadi, , scratched the card off to reveal three winning pharoahs. She was staring at the ticket for two hours, she was traumatised because she couldnt believe what was happening in front of her, he said.  I had to pull the card out of her hand and then saw the same thing and she was seeing. Its a winner. Angela believes Camelot is refusing to pay out because it wants to avoid coughing up millionsthere is a widespread fault with the cards.   The mum-of-two said: “I told‘you’ve got a faulty batch and you know it and are trying not to pay out’. “It makes me feel angry because they’re denying me a legit pay-out.” The game offers five top prizes of pound, by giving sixteen co-ordinates which are used to scratch off squares on a grid in the hope of matching three pharaoh symbols. Camelot insists the winning ticket has not yet been claimed and denied claims of a faulty batch. A spokesman said: We do not believe this to be a faulty batch as Ms Mason claims. We will reconstruct the card in our system, just as we did in Mr Walkers case, to determine whether it is a genuine winning ticket. If webelieve that somebody has intentionally attempted to defraud The National Lottery,then, just like any other company, we reserve the right to take whatever action we consider is appropriate – which includes reporting the matter to the police.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tiny studio flat costing 250000","story":"NewsThis tiny studio flat costing £, is Londons most viewed homeProperty website Zoopla says this cramped abode in west London has been been viewed hundreds of times this monthShareCommentsByAngie QuinnNeil Murphy:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAt £,, the tiny flat is described as a bargain for the area \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis cramped west London abode has been viewed more times than any other home in the capital, according to property website Zoopla.

Karen Kaheni, , developed an overwhelming desire to munch on the ends of her JPS Blue cigarettes last year – and soon after started yearning for blackboard chalk as well. The heavy smoker, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, east the cigarette butts as she watches TV every evening. She also eats g of chalk every week, costing pound online. She attributes her weird cravings to Pica, a condition that involves eating items like dirt and paint chips. “It’s really embarrassing and I have no idea what triggered it,” she said. “It isn’t so much the taste of the cigarette butts or the chalk that I like – it’s more the texture and the crunch. “Now though, my cravings are so strong that when I run out of chalk or don’t have a cigarette at hand, I get quite agitated and my mouth begins to water. “It’s a real addiction.”  Karen, who is blind and has two daughters Danielle, , and Sara, , remembers wanting to eat chalk while she was carrying her youngest girl. But she has no idea what prompted her full-blown addiction, which began  years later. “I had quite a late pregnancy and towards the last few weeks, I remember getting this massive urge to grind my teeth on something hard and chalky,” she recalled. “I’d find myself fantasising about the old blackboard chalk that we had at school.” But Karen – who cannot work because of her disability – never acted out on her weird impulses and after Sara’s birth the urge to eat chalk disappeared, until  when, from nowhere, she was overwhelmed with a desire to munch on cigarette butts. “Because of my blindness I have to be very careful where I put my fag ends, so I don’t burn the house down,” she said. “I usually put them in a little tin filled with water, so that they immediately extinguish. “But, one night while I was watching telly, I just thought, ‘Why not give eating one a try  “Again, it was the texture more than anything I was after. The taste was pretty disgusting – very bitter and salty – but I liked the crunch of them in my mouth.”  Very quickly Karen – who smokes between  and  cigarettes a day – realised it wasn’t a one off craving but a full-blown addiction. Ashamed of her bizarre habit, Karen, who has been blind since suffering meningitis when she was , kept it from her partner Andrew Simon, , and her daughters. But the nicotine-heavy diet began to take its toll on her digestive system, giving her constant diarrhoea. Despairing when she could not cut down, despite the discomfort, she came clean and told Andrew. “He looked at me and thought I was a complete weirdo,” she said. “And I don’t really blame him. “But he couldn’t help me and I was too embarrassed to go to a doctor about it, so I just kept suffering.”   Her eating disorder got worse and worse until April  when, during a visit to her courier sister, Zohreh, , in London, Karen’s longing to eat chalk also ed. “I was outside in my sister’s garden one night smoking, when a desire to have a nibble on the brick wall just struck me,” she recalled. “I scraped a bit off with my nail and ate it. It was so satisfying – just the texture and feeling that I had been longing for.” But she knew she couldn’t go on like that, already suffering with a constantly upset tummy from her condition. Karen knew that eating chalk – which contains the chemical elements arsenic and nickel – would be foolish. So she found a website selling edible natural chalk imported from Russia, for pound for g, which she could eat to her heart’s content. Her chalk habit has helped her to cut back on eating nub ends – with her now consuming just two or three a day – but, already conscious of being a heavy smoker, she is concerned about the side effects of all elements of her strange diet on her health. “I don’t really want to tell people about it, especially not doctors, so now only my close family and a few friends know,” she said. “I did recently discover a Facebook page for people with Pica and that has been really useful for me. “It’s nice to know that it isn’t just me and there are other people out there with the same problem. “It makes me feel like less of a weirdo – less like I’m going mad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee chief john nelms says funding for 15m new stadium is taking a long long time","story":"Dundee managing director

decision before each game whether to stick with Hamilton or go with rival Elliott Parish.Parish has only featured once since Jim took the reins in the middle of October, a painful - defeat at Livingston that kicked off the new manager’s time at the club.With that result in mind and Hamilton impressing in recent weeks, you’d be forgiven for thinking Parish had had his chance.However, Jim is delighted to have a tough decision to agonise over each week with two good goalies to choose from – evenhe admits Hamilton has shown his best form of the season recently.The Dens gaffer said: “Like any new player Jack’s probably taken a wee while to settle in at the club.“Both goalkeepers have been good, it’s been a close call to see who plays because both train really well and both are great lads.“I thought last week against Hamilton was Jack’s strongest game in everything he did.“People notice saves but there was a through ball where he was right off his line and his starting position was good and overall he was switched on.“You need to be at this level or you get punished.”He added: “I don’t think Jack had too many saves to make on Sunday against Rangers but he came and claimed a few crosses which helped out his back four.”"},{"url":null,"title":"long awaited us takeover of dundee united moves closer","story":"Rumours the long-awaited Dundee United takeover is nearing

anything less than 100","story":"Dundee United striker Pavol Safranko cut a frustrated figure reliving Saturday’s disappointing - draw with Morton and admits they need to do more to rediscover their best form and top the table.The Slovakian striker has been praised this season for his contribution both on and off the ball – he has netted seven times in all competitions and covers plenty ground for his side – however, he feels he and his team-mates need to do more to get results than just play nice football.Freddy Frans’ headed opener after  minutes wasn’t enough at Cappielow at the weekend as Gregor Buchanan nodded home an equaliser into an empty with  minutes to go and, although upset he couldn’t add to his tally of goals to get the three points for the Terrors, Safranko knows the whole team needs to work harder and show their true qualities and grind out results.“We can do better, we have to do better,” he said.“I think we always look to ourselves but our performance must be better.“Even when we concede a goal we still have all this quality and power in our team to go up but we just have to take a long, hard look in the mirror now and work hard and we will be back.“Morton tried and they worked hard, but like I said, we have the quality to be successful in the game but I can say that we are really disappointed.”The -year-old has been happy to make a good start to le at Tannadice, scoring goals and becoming a fans’ favourite but also concedes the whole squad is hurting after failing to close the gap more on leaders Ayr United at the top of the Championship.Dropping two points in Greenock, after Ross County drew with Queen of the South and Ayr saw their clash with Inverness postponed, feels like a loss and a chance missed for the Tangerines but Safranko insists their ambitions are unwavering as they prepare for a trip to face Caley Thistle in the Highlands on Saturday.“It’s not a step back in our ambitions to win the league but we have to be careful and be ready for every game,” he added.“We can’t find any excuses going up to Inverness or at Morton, we have to just go there and put our % in.“Everyone has to show their best and, hopefully, after that we can win.“I have enjoyed my time here playing and scoring goals but, like the rest of the team, I want to be better for every game, that’s all I can say.”United boss Robbie Neilson echoed his star striker’s sentiments, expressing his anger at his side not being able to break down Morton nor hold onto their lead and see the result out.He said: “We got the goal and probably could’ve got more but in the second half we got caught up in the direct game.“They went direct into the striker and played off of that but we lacked the composure to bring the ball down and pass it that got us the success in the first half.“We could have won it with some chances late on but it should have been put to bed by then“We shouldn’t need to do that at the end and we should’ve killed the game earlier but also we should be able to hold onto a - lead.“We know playing against Morton they’ve got good delivery with Michael Tidser and have got big centre-halves that can come up so we know we shouldn’t be giving free-kicks away round about the box.“We gave away a schoolboy free-kick, Chris Millar’s out on the touchline with nowhere to go and two guys roundabout him but we steamroller into the back of him.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb4708a077.jpg ","title":"tom duthie lets hope christmas hasnt come early for dundee united","story":"Has Christmas come early for Dundee United fans  For once the answer to that question is they definitely hope not.For most of us getting to unwrap a package in advance of the th of this month is a happy bonus butthe festive season has arrived early for Arabs this year, they won’t be happy.That’s because last year, Christmas brought the first strong indication things under then new boss Csaba Laszlo were not going to work out.Dismissing what was a largely irrelevant Irn-Bru Cup defeat against Crusaders, technically his first game in charge, an impressive start that had produced four wins and a draw was brought to a shuddering halt with a late December defeat against leaders and eventual champions St Mirren.It was a reversal from which the Tangerines, and ultimately the gaffer, never really recovered.From having the chance to hit the top of the table as they travelled to Paisley that night, within weeks, any chance of automatic promotion was effectively gone.January this year brought a humiliating - defeat away to a Falkirk side who were struggling near the bottom of the Championship and the month ended with an almost equally painful home loss to Morton.Coming as they did in the weeks following the Buddies clash, those were defeats that pretty much confirmed United were not getting back to the Premiership at the end of the season.Now, under another new managerial appointment in Robbie Neilson, the team could be in danger of following a similar path to last term, albeit it a few weeks earlier.Five wins and a draw into his reign, the other week saw a wake-up call like the one his predecessor received when leaders Ayr United came to Tannadice and dealt out a - thrashing.That was alarming and the bells had barely stopped ringing before there was more concern as Robbie’s team squandered a lead at Morton last Saturday and had to settle for a draw. Festive flippancy aside, there is, of course, reason to believe the slide in results presided over by Csaba will not be repeated this time round.Under the new boss, the Tangerines have looked better organised and with a clearer game plan than they’ve probably had since the early days of Jackie McNamara’s time in charge, or certainly since Ray McKinnon’s first term in charge.Their style under this gaffer, by no means just blood and thunder, is more robust and therefore better suited to the physical rigours of Scotland’s second tier.On top of that, and in part it should be said because of Csaba’s ability to identy decent talent, there can be little argument this season’s squad contains better overall quality.In striker Pavol Safranko they have a front man of the calibre many teams even at top-flight level must be anxious off.And wide man Fraser Aird has been another astute signing who, like Safranko, has really come into his own under the current boss.There is also reason to believe his past, successful, experience of Championship football when he raced to promotion at Hearts means that come next month’s transfer window, Robbie will get exactly what he needs to strengthen the weaker areas of his team.The impressive form of Ayr United does remain a worry and, as they showed at Tannadice the week before last, they have to be regarded as serious promotion contenders.Ross County and this weekend’s opponents Inverness also remain challengers.And another disappointment against them could have fans worried about that early Christmas gt."},{"url":null,"title":"we are the team no one wants to play says dundees gensy kusunga","story":"Gensy Kusunga says Dundee used to be the team everybody wanted to play – now they are the team nobody wants to face he’s urged his team-mates to keep their focus.The impressive defensive display which earned the Dark Blues a - draw at home to Rangers, despite being reduced to  men after just  minutes, lted the side off the foot of the Premiership table for the first time since August.And that was in no small part down to the solid defensive display from Angolan international Kusunga, alongside centre-back partner Andy Boyle.Between them, they repelled everything Rangers threw into the box to keep up their unbeaten run, which now stretches to four matches.And the confidence which is oozing through the team now, allied to that dogged defensive display, will mean nobody will fancy facing Dundee in the coming weeks, evenit is Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and Celtic away next.Kusunga said: “I hope that is the case!“It’s good to hear that other teams won’t want to play us.“Before everyone wanted to play us to take confidence! Now it has turned around but we need to continue.“It’s good to have confidence – but not too much!“We have to still work, work, work and not feel we are there because we drew and won one game.“We have to stay focused and, hopefully, we can get some good results before the break.”The former Basel defender is delighted the club’s form has turned around but has urged the Dark Blues not to relax as they bid to continue their resurgence in the busiest time of the season.After three matches on the road in seven days, Dundee will welcome Livingston to Dens Park on Boxing Day before St Johnstone make the short trip from Perth on December .Despite moving off the bottom of the Premiership table, Kusunga knows the work has only just begun and wants the “belief” that has surged through the team to continue.He added: “We are happy because we had to work hard for the draw with  men against Rangers.“It was a good game, a massive game for us and to take points was the most important thing.“We are happy but we need to stay focused.“The road is a long one and we need keep our focus for the next game and the many games in December where we need to get points.“We showed a lot of belief on Sunday,  against  for so long and never put our heads down. We stayed strong, stayed together and everybody worked, worked, worked – when you do that you can get results, that’s the key.“It was important for the confidence to keep our run going but we can’t relax, the way is long and we have to take things game after game and do the maximum we can.”The dference in Dundee’s displays over the past few weeks and the rest of the campaign is a marked one with the side trebling their points total in the last four matches.And Kusunga says taking responsibility as a team rather than pointing to inidual errors has been a massive factor.He said: “Everybody is taking responsibility. Before we could always say we didn’t win because of one mistake, you need to take responsibility and work like men.”And he’s urged the Dark Blues to repeat their show against Rangers in the coming weeks.He added: “Every game is hard, the opponents are strong in every game and we can’t think about playing a small team or playing a big team.“Every match is dficult and we need to work hard the same against whoever we play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"craig-gordon-is-celtics-pass-master-so-dont-expect-him-to-back-to-punting-the-ball","story":"TAKE a guess at which Celtic player can boast a  per cent passing completion record in more than one game this season."},{"url":null,"title":"cher-in-glasgow-ticketmaster-urges-fans-to-prepare-ahead-of-mad-ticket-rush","story":"THE news will still be sinking in for many of our readers today that the legendary Cher has announced shersquos coming to perform in Glasgow next year."},{"url":null,"title":"sspca-reveal-christmas-wishlist-in-plea-for-festive-donations","story":"SCOTLANDS animal charity is calling on kind-hearted Glaswegians to donate essentials to its Glasgow centre."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-to-receive-23-pay-rise-next-year","story":"MSPs will receive a pay increase of .% from April next year, it has been announced."},{"url":null,"title":"senior-celtic-players-intervened-to-alert-brendan-rodgers-to-leigh-griffiths-situation","story":"Brendan Rodgers has explained that an incident with Leigh Grfiths brought the strikerrsquos illness to a head when a number of senior players intervened in order to try and facilitate some help for the Scotland internationalist."},{"url":null,"title":"pm-theresa-may-wont-lead-tories-into-general-election","story":"Theresa May has told Conservative MPs she will not lead the party into the next general election."},{"url":null,"title":"more-cops-drafted-into-city-centre-for-busy-christmas-party-weekends","story":"MORE cops will be drafted in to police Glasgow city centre and handle the festive revellers coming in for Christmas parties on the traditional Black Friday weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"streets-ahead-8-glasgow-super-school-leads-the-way-with-eco-day","story":"CARING for the environment is a big focus for our Streets Ahead campaign - and nobody does it better than our cityrsquos schoolchildren."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-budget-derek-mackays-view-on-how-it-impacts-glasgow","story":"THE Scottish Budget is a budget of stimulus and stability, writes Finance Secretary Derek Mackay:"},{"url":null,"title":"budget-2018-neither-reckless-nor-radical-from-derek-mackay","story":"For years the SNP said they would be progressive on tax."},{"url":null,"title":"road-accident-numbers-rise-1-after-stricter-drink-driving-limit","story":"STRICT new Scottish drink driving laws have not helped cut the number of road traffic accidents, a new Glasgow University study shows."},{"url":null,"title":"world-class-10000-bartenders-to-descend-on-glasgow-for-massive-global-competition","story":"MORE than , bartenders from across the globe will descend on Glasgow next year for the worldrsquos biggest bartending competition, it has been confirmed."},{"url":null,"title":"leigh-griffiths-celtic-star-speaks-out-for-first-time","story":"Celtic striker Leigh Grfiths has assured fans he is doing everything he can toto football a \"better and stronger person\"."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-to-transform-disused-glasgow-pub-into-lgbtq-nightclub-get-go-ahead","story":"Glasgow will soon be welcoming a new LGBTQ+ nightclub in the city centre."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118744.jpg","title":"City schools close to full","story":"New Highland Council figures show that many Inverness schools will soon join Charleston Academy in exceeding  per cent capacity.The numbers were released with a formal assessment stating the region has a sufficient supply of land to build new homes ndash which some say is the source of the problem to begin with.Councillor Jimmy Gray said: ldquoThere are concerns right across Highland but particularly in Inverness about the capacity of our schools to deal with what we have got.ldquoWe need to get bigger schools, get more schools, but in some areas we have got limited capacity in the existing school space to develop them.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have been fobbed off before with mitigation rather than a solution, and the Scottish Government must live up to its promises this time around.The group of hardy souls taking to the streets next month to highlight homelessness deserve a pat on the back.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":null,"title":"speedy kirsty points the way ahead for dad","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAt the age of , Kirsty Mochrie made her first outing as navigator for Innes Mochrie at the  Kingdom Stages rally.Seasoned campaigner Innes, who happens to be Kirsty#s dad, was well guided around the course in their Kilmory Coachworks .Kirsty#s gran Libby told the Advertiser: #She just loved it.

Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll flower club hosts christmas special","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Flower Club members welcomed Sandra Robertson from Dumfries to their annual open evening on Monday December .A packed house watched with interest as Sandra created amazing Christmas-themed displays.Lucky raffle winners left with beautul arrangements that, with care and attention, could see them through Christmas.Sandra, who won Best in Show  at Gardening Scotland with a James Bond inspired arrangement, was an excellent demonstrator and told many humorous stories of her #flower le# to an enthralled and appreciative audience."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee to support baby unit","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAn Ardrishaig woman plans to throw herself into the icy sea on New Year#s Day.Joan Williamson is taking part in the Loony Dook at South Queensferry to raise money for the Simpsons Special Care Babies unit in Edinburgh, which looked after Joan and her twin daughters Angel and Star when they were born prematurely.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

A positive inspection report from Education Scotland found consistently “good” performance across the board at Stration Primary School and Eary Years Centre. The inspectors came to their conclusions after a recent visit to the school that included discussions with parents, children and staff. The inspection team found the following strengths in the school’s work: • Headteacher Liz Candlish leads the strong staff team to achieve the best quality educational experiences in a learning environment which is nurturing and encouraging. • The motivated children who are engaged in their learning. Their exemplary behaviour is respectful and caring of adults and each other. • The strong links and involvement with members of the community. They feel valued by staff and enhance children’s outdoor experiences and enterprise activities. The following areas for improvement were identied: • The school should take steps to increase the pace and progression of children’s learning to raise attainment. • Assessment data collected from a range of sources should now be acted on more consistently to ensure maximum impact on the attainment of a few learners. • A structured approach to develop more independent learners, who can talk about their learning and be clear about their next steps. Councillor William Grant said: “I’m pleased to see such a positive report for Straiton, with staff delivering high quality learning for all children, something that should come as welcome news to families. “Headteacher, Liz Candlish, was singled out for providing strong leadership, with the school thriving and providing a nurturing environment that is inspiring children to embrace learning and to care for each other. “I would like to thank everyone involved for working hard to maintain the high standards at Straiton.” Inspectors are confident that the school has the capacity to continue to improve and so they will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.

make her mark.In  she became the first professor of politics in the whole of Ireland.A colleague remembered that she came to Queenrsquos as a breath of fresh air, in part because her appointment

In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend.

That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes!

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

Seasports SCIO.#We are very pleased to see the project move forward to the current position where a broad range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social cohesion through volunteering and introduce many, particularly young people, to their first structured employment as instructors within their chosen water sport.#We are clear that developing grass roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity, it is entirely conceivable that future events in dinghy racing, sea kayaking, coastal rowing and yacht racing will find a regular home in Campbeltown, facilitated by the skills and resources of the Kintyre Seasports Project.#RYA Scotland is excited by the prospects of the Kintyre Seasports Project and remains committed to supporting its development for the future.#We commend the efforts of all in reaching this point and look forward to being a part of one of

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

In future, though, I will not be quite so hasty to pass judgement.My first ndash and hopefully last ndash experience of refereeing a match came when I went to watch my eldest son play for his school team. As the game was about to kick-off it emerged no whistler had turned up. So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls. Had he sensed my deep-rooted anti-blue agenda Then there was my positioning. I made Willie Young look like Kylian Mbappe as a I lumbered about the pitch trying to keep up with the action. But I lost count of the occasions I found myself either in the way of play or in a hopeless vantage point.How do referees possibly work out in the blink of an eyea player who was in an offside position had been interfering with play after a goal is scored by a team mate  How do they cope with making such a call in front of tens of thousands of people  The mind truly boggled.Several Stella after the ordeal, I concluded that referees are selfless not clueless iniduals, have a nigh on impossible task and deserve our sympathy and support not abuse and opprobrium.At the very least, they need VAR. The system, as we saw at Russia , isnrsquot perfect, but in an age when every passage of play is filmed from half a dozen dferent angles and incidents dissected the instant they happen, it would help quell a growing disaffection with match officials and make their lives easier."},{"url":null,"title":"celtics-leigh-griffiths-allowed-time-out-to-deal-with-ongoing-issues","story":"The former Hibs and Wolves hitman has been plagued with injury issues this season and has struggled for game time as the second choice striker behind club-record signing Odsonne Edouard.Grfiths was also disappointed to have been left out of the Scotland side for the UEFA Nations League match against Albania in September and has not featured for Alex McLeishs national side since.Rodgers insists that he has a strong relationship with the player and that the Parkhead club will do everything they can to help him get back to full health.\"Leigh will be out of football for a little period of time,\" Rodgers said. \"Hes had ongoing issues for a number of months.

Irsquod honestly never thought of it before and the idea came from there.The idea has spawned a comic script collaboration with Italian artist Katia Vecchio, and the creation of Warpaint, which Sherry says is comparable with s coming of age films Stand By Me and Goonies, but told from a feminist perspective.He said: ldquoThe comic uses menstruation as one of the themes, and how girls are expected to be ashamed of it, but the lead character is a woman who is very up-front about that sort of thing.ldquoThe characters have a fantasy world that they go to, a place where they imagine a better world and try to bring that world into reality. And in that fantasy world theyrsquore not ashamed of their blood, their menstruation.ldquoItrsquos called Warpaint because the characters use their menstrual blood as a stand against the patriarchy and misogyny of their small-town upbringing.ldquoItrsquos a dficult thing for a man to be writing about and I did a lot of talking with my female friends and to gauge how a woman feels about a man writing or co-writing.ldquoI asked things about the consistency of menstrual blood, and whether it was possible to use it as war paint. I discovered it was.ldquoBut Irsquom not trying to tell women about menstruation. If anything, itrsquos for men like me who never actually think about it.The project comes in the wake of a major drive to eradicate period poverty, something which one in five women in Scotland have experienced.Earlier this year the Scottish Government became the first in the world to make sanitary products available for free to all , of its pupils in a bid to ensure girls didnrsquot miss out on any part of their education through a lack of access to sanitary products.Councillor Alison Evison, president of Cosla, said the pound. million initiative would ldquocontribute to a more open conversation and reducing the unnecessary stigma associated with periods.Warpaint is published on worldwide online comic  ComiXology, and will be followed by a novel and solo album which Sherry is currently recording at Chem  studios in Blantyre, Lanarkshire with leading indie producer Paul Savage.It follows the story of a -year-old girl being brought up by her religious grandparents, and navigating the impact of misogyny and bullying on women and men in small-town Scotland.Sherry said: ldquoShersquos trying to escape and find a better le for herself. Shersquos the kind of rare kid you meet who doesnrsquot back down in the face of authority.Sherry is the lead singer and co-songwriter in Attic Lights, who have released two albums with a third due next year.He says he thinks of his songs as ldquosongs women might write.ldquoThe way I make my melodies work, and the way I sing also has a feminine quality, he said. ldquoI went to that place, and also to the place where I had to take my male ego to pieces. But I couldnrsquot have done it without Katia, shersquos what makes it ring true.ldquoThe comic takes a fairly militant feminist slant on patriarchal attitudes towards menstruation and how young girls and your women are treated in society. But at its heart itrsquos a human story about friendship and regret and courage and kids who want to change the world being let down by adults who supposedly know better.The writer acknowledged the influence of comics such as Dundeersquos iconic Beano, and  AD whose character Judge Dredd was conceived by Greenock-raised John Wagner. Other Scottish comic book success stories include Frank Quitely and Grant Morrison.Sherry said: ldquoI worship at the feet of people like Grant Morrison. Irsquove been buying comics since as early as I can remember. The true love of my le is AD, which I still read to this day. Itrsquos responsible for my political and moral outlook on le."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-now-is-surely-the-time-for-another-national-government","story":"There are voices of real ability and sound common sense across parties to be found in Westminster. Sadly these voices are too often drowned out by the febrile claims of the Brexiters. A change of leadership in the Tory Party is unlikely to rescue us from the mess that we are in. Nor is a General Election, given the present polls, going to produce a strong government that commands a majority in the House. Given the real and present danger of political chaos, then surely there is now a strong case for political leadership that will act in the best interests of the country and form a National Government.Now that we know the frightening costs and consequences of leaving the EU, then hopefully one of the first decisions of such a government would be to go back to the people with a second referendum. Even more hopefully would be a decision to introduce proportional representation for future Westminster General Elections and to abolish the undemocratic, anachronistic House of Lords.Eric Melvin, Cluny Place, Edinburgh.NOW we know what the Conservative Brexiters meant when they said \"Brexit means Brexit\". They have assiduously worked to prevent the Prime Minister getting a deal that would benefit the country solely that they could take the opportunity to advance their own political careers: the real purpose of Brexit all along. Now, in the midst of a constitutional crisis that threatens the economic and social welfare of not only ourselves, but our children and grandchildren ndash as they themselves have constantly reminded us - they choose, with Brexit Day only weeks away, to plunge the country and the EU negotiations into turmoil. If I may paraphrase a famous Prime Minister, never in the history of this United Kingdom has there been such a bunch of self-seeking political chancers.These \"Honourable\" Members have shown their true colours and their total disregard for anything other than their own greed, and the public should treat them as the worthless egotists they have shown themselves to be, and consign them to the political wilderness.T J Dowds,q Fleming Road, Cumbernauld.SEVERAL of your correspondents todaysuggest sympathy for Theresa May would be appropriate.Have they forgotten that she was part of a government which imposed such brutal austerity on the poorest members of society that they were disposed to lash out at the Establishment in any way they could Have they forgotten that she fed the flames of that disaffection by introducing the xenophobic \"hostile environment\" policies while she was at the Home Office Have they forgotten her behaviour during the pre Brexit debate, when she made herself so invisible that she was known as \"Submarine May\" Mrs May deserves no ones sympathy. She is probably the most self-serving and leadership-obsessed politician I have witnessed in more than  years of political awareness.John Jamieson, Craigie Road, Ayr.I SAY to JS Morrisonthat a gerrymandered referendum has no place in a mature democracy, which most of us thought ours was until recently, and that he is in fact arguing that lies and financial misbehaviour do.Furthermore, the referendum, as I understand it, was advisory, Parliament and not the People being sovereign for good reason. The purpose of our representative democracy is to ldquoprovide a filter against mob rule, moods and errors . Elitist  No way. It stems from an understanding of how easily the voters can be manipulated by malign forces.John Milne, Ardgowan Drive, Uddingston.SO Lord Foulkes wishes to sort out the constitutional position of England . He seems to think sticking a few devolved assemblies in England will assuage the lack of a devolved parliament in that country, when many of us regard Westminster as very much Englandrsquos parliament. When Keir Hardie advocated Scotland having Dominion status, I doubt he would have settled for Holyrood, with its lack of authority, power and sovereignty. What will be the role of Westminster  What is the point of the Lords, evennew placemen replace old placemen  I can see no future in Lord Foulkess proposals. The UK is a lopsided, largely non-democratic, constitutional monstrosity, where we even have to pay to have a British state broadcaster . I think Northern Ireland will go to join the Republic fairly soonas the standard of living in the south overtakes that in the north. Scotland will either be first to leave or a close second, Brexit having opened our eyes to our true status within the UK.GR Weir, Mill Street, Ochiltree.ALEXANDER McKaywrites that the ldquoever-opportunistic SNP are ldquopolitical pygmies. Could I just remind him that at the  UK General Election the SNP won an incredible  Westminster seats out of .In all my  years, this result is by far and away the most astounding and resounding UK election achievement by any UK party. EvenI live another  years I donrsquot expect that this will ever be repeated.What is noticeable to me is that Unionists on both sides of the ldquotraditional political ide never miss any opportunity to denigrate this achievement.I am a socialist by nature and voted Labour in every election at all levels until I was well into my s, as did many working-class folk like me.However, even I can see that the SNPrsquos accomplishment in  reflects widespread deep-seated dissatisfaction in Scotland with the UK status quo. This will not dissipate easilyhellipespecially now.How someone can describe the SNP as pygmies is incomprehensible unless that someone has a vested interest in attempting to ignore what is clearly in

It isn’t intended to be a ‘straight’ narrative as you usually see, but as in a fairy tale there are strange detours, unexplained events, outcomes out of all proportion to what caused them – a kind of rough and dangerous magic working beneath the surface.Aside from that, each page of the book was crafted to be as inidually beautul as I could make it. Every page took at least a few days to create, and some pages took weeks, even months.Where did the inspiration for this book come from There are so many ideas that have fed into The Boy with Nails for Eyes that it’s very hard to pin it down to a single moment of inspiration. When I was at school, I was struck by a painting done by a previous student. It was a very unnerving picture — a spectral, jagged figure with crude smears of black where the eyes should be.Many years later I saw the music video for the Tool song Sober. There was a brief glimpse of a mechanical figure with a metal mask for a face, with one eye missing and the other pierced by this huge swivelling nail. I thought of Norse mythology — Odin, sacricing one of his eyes in the well of Mimir to gain wisdom. That second image married with the memory of the painting from school that same evening, I painted the first picture of The Boy with Nails for Eyes. A few weeks later, the story began to slowly take shape.It’s changed beyond recognition over the years, taking on influences such as the War on Terror of the early s. I was born in Bahrain and was there during the Gulf War. We were all issued with gas masks by the American military, and I remember waking up one night to find the rest of my family in my room, my mum holding the masks, my dad stuffing a towel under the door. It turned out Iraq had launched a Scud — we were all terried of the thought of chemical weapons. I recognised that same feeling of paranoia in the days after September the th, and Bush’s declaration of the War on Terror. That feeling pervades the story.How did the crowdfunding for this book come about I had been shopping the comic around to agents and publishers for a long time. I found it to be a frustrating process. I tended to receive positive responses, which were still rejections. I was running out of options, and was wondering where I’d go nextI wasn’t able to place it with anyone. I received a boost when the book was long-listed for the Myriad First Graphic Novel competition earlier this year.I was speaking to an editor at Unbound, the publisher, about an entirely dferent project — an illustrated poem. Almost as an aside I mentioned that I had this other graphic novel whose first volume was finished and ready to go. I showed her the first couple of chapters and she fell in love with it . We decided to temporarily shelve the other project and proceed with this.What would it mean to you to see this book published It would be fantastic. I’ve been working on the project over  years, since my early twenties. It’s been a labour of love — for myself and my we Anna as well, who had major input into the work. I honestly had no thought of publishing it properly, it was just important to me to allow it to be exactly the story it needed to be. I basically taught myself digital art by working on it, and honed my drawing and writing skills through it. It sounds strange, but I’m as much its product as it is mine. Having it out there as a book, something physical that can be picked up and read, would make it real in a way that it isn’t yet, for all that I’m satisfied that the story is what it should be – or near as I can make it.To find our more about The Boy with Nails for Eyes and support Shaun#s project visit: www.unbound books nails-for-eyes copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This wee semi-detached cottage had no bathroom, no running hot water and no inside toilet so inevitably we loved it. Jeannie, our rotund grandmother, really was the stereotypical granny living in a house at the bottom of the woods and spoiled us within her limited means . My grandfather, also Jimmy, was an astonishingly good-looking man with crystal blue eyes he was a Stalinist for rather longer than was fashionable, and worked at Glenochil, the huge whisky bond, as a foreman, which to my unpractised eye meant he sat and read for a living: he was the only man I’ve ever known who took three novels to work. But he saved a man’s le in a terrible accident, being injured himself into a premature death – another, sadder, story as well.Anyway, Papa Jimmy used to take us for a walk in the woods on a fine day, thenus to the house for our lunch, which always included masses of butter, a substance somewhat rationed in our own home. Jimmy would retire to his chair and read the paper and chain smoke, ashing his fags into an ornate standing ashtray which was an object of great fascination to me and which I eventually inherited. On these walks, a bit like Uncle Pumblechook in ‘Great Expectations’, Papa Jimmy would ask us questions relating to our general knowledge – the times tables, dates in Scottish history, capital cities of the world. This once led to an argument – of quite heated proportions, because both these Jimmys were obstinate fellows – about the capital of Ceylon. Young Jimmy, probably about , knew it was Colombo old Jimmy, about , insisted it was Kandy. At eight, I did not feel well placed to intervene and contented myself with playing with bugs.: Cameron Wyllie: Face facts, some kids are smarter than othersGeneral knowledge was part of our lives then it was part of everyone’s. Twenty years later, in the s, as a young schoolteacher, I would always have a quiz book ready in my desk as an end-of-term treat: classes in teams, rounds of questions, sweeties as prizes. Even ‘less academically able’ boys – for this was a boys’ school – knew stuff, random facts about Russia or prime numbers or current affairs. Thirty years on, at the end of my career, I used to take great pleasure in the success of the school quiz teams indeed, we even granted our ‘quizzers’ the sacred right of ‘colours’ eventually, so the really successful ones went round the school with blazer badges saying ‘quiz’. No-one but me and other gnarled ancients thought this was remotely strange – that something as ordinary as general knowledge was in our youth had become a specialised extra-curricular activity – you did ‘quiz’ while others played the oboe or threw the discus.Does this matter  Clearly, the school curriculum has to move with the times and technology means that all of us can get away with knowing less stuff than we used to – when you don’t know somethingyou just Google it. Who is that actress  Who was that king  What, for God’s sake, is the capital of Ceylon, and why is it not called Ceylon anymore, and what can be done to stop brain cells oozing out my ears ...  I can’t be alone in suppressing a deeply rooted grumble when the nice girl in the shop reaches for a calculator to work out what  per cent of £ is, and then laboriously subtracts £. from £ etc etc. But, does it matter : Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upWell, it must a bit. If you don’t know that you need to know something, then you can’t Google it. Lots of information that was reasonably common currency simply isn’t there in the minds of young people and has been replaced by dferent skills, of which they have many. However,you are, for example, teaching a text that refers directly or indirectly to something  – the mention of Icarus in a poem by W H Auden, say, and the clever children in your Higher English class don’t have a scoobie who Icarus was, then they are, quite clearly, not able to understand the poem. Again, in the great scheme of things, this may not matter very much, but,we do not have things to connect, then E M Forster’s much-quoted dictum “only connect” cannot happen some intellectual breakthroughs just require two bits of factual knowledge to be laid side by side. All of this may just be a reaction to skills-based learning. Someone who did O-grade history in the s or s just would not recognise a National  paper today and I suspect that most history teachers would say that these changes are entirely right. I honestly think there is validity in both approaches, but I’m afraid I also have a little feeling in my tummy that says that knowing more things is one of the proofs that you are grown up.

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests.

He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view. One person favoured Theresa May’s deal, two opted for leaving with no deal and  said their preference was to stay in the bloc.Isn#t the whole idea of Brexit, to do with the Conservatives wanting a trade deal with the USA, without the interference of the EU This will also, I think, be the beginning of the mass privatization of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to USA companies, where the Conservatives will benefit from such a deal  .The impact on Shetland, I fear, will be very damaging indeed, as economic circumstances will mean a vast reduction of Local Authority spending. This will also force the SIC to do huge cuts in budgets and very much streamline and prioritize what money goes where.This will force many other companies and people owning their own business to either reduce the workforce or shut up shop The general outlook does not look favourable for Shetland in the long term.I sincerely hope my outlook is proven wrong  finally Mr Carmichael should know that the only reform of the eu that they will be doing is ever closer integration. Starting with what his former leader called a DANGEROUS FANTASY dreamed up by brexiteers, an EU ARMY. Well that DANGEROUS FANTASY has been seen to be a DANGEROUS REALITY since the referendum with EU armoured personel carriers on the streets of Paris battling french protestors.Is this DANGEROUS REALITY stuff for real Someone may have been listening to Trump and Farage#s comments on the EU army without turning on their b.s. filter.Why shouldn#t EU nations cooperate in defence matters  Is Ali saying NATO is a bad thing Since  it has become politically correct for democratic European neighbours to cooperate. Why not get over it What is this DANGEROUS REALITY Ali fears  Does he imagine the purpose of a EU army would be to attack domestic protesters across frontiers like the Soviet army did in Hungary in   Does he see the EU as a fascist entity that must be stopped  Before you know it he will be advocating the citizen#s right to bear arms so as to protect itself against the government like they do in the good old US of A. Just how whacky is his DANGEROUS REALTY No one gets to choose their nationality Ali, just how we feel about it. There is nothing natural or God-given in being Scottish, British, German or European. Why not celebrate what we have in common and not obsess about invented dferences resulting from random man made lines on a map  Scary scary stuff. and only a line on a map drawn by a king that separates Scotland and England.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too. I want the whole thing investigated by the proper authorities so this does not happen to another family.#Miss MacLeod, who said the case was #a clear abuse of Eilidh#s human rights#, was not interested in any apology from the council. The case has been raised with local MSP Alasdair Allan.He said: #I have met with Eilidh and her family. I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8734911.1544460417!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonathan rea honorary degree i feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it s nice to be recognised","story":"Four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea has received an honorary degree for his outstanding contribution to sport.The Co Antrim racer received the honorary degree of Doctor of Lettersfrom Ulster University at its winter graduation ceremony.World Superbike Champion Jonathan Rea collects his Honorary Graduate from the University of UlsterOf the occasion at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, he said: “It’s dficult to stand in a room full of highly educated people and receive an award like that when I haven’t gone to university. “But I have served my time.

While the band’s line-up has inevitably changed over the years, brothers George and Eddie Furey have continued to tour the globe, bringing the finest ballads to generations old and new.To celebrate their th anniversary they have released a new album, ‘The Fureys  Years On… to be continued’, and will play a headline gig at Belfast’s Waterfront this January.Ahead of the gig, the Andersonstown News met with George and Eddie, who had just ed from the Netherlands leg of their jubilee tour. While their music has touched thousands,not millions of people, George and Eddie are a pair without air and graces. Our chat was an informal one that took place in the Waterfront Hall’s lobby, with school kids, excited by their trip to the panto, providing an excitable background hum. As for the story of The Fureys – it’s one of famous faces, infamous sessions, and more years worth of craic than can be adequately depicted in a single newspaper article. However, with the release of their new album – which foregoes many of the obvious tracks and is jammed full of new material – our conversation almost immediately turned to things more current.“A lot of the songs we would’ve heard as kids and would’ve grown up singing them,” Eddie explained.“Streets of London is one of them, which was written by Ralph McTell, and we know Ralph going back many, many years.”George added: “The first track on the album was written by a Donegal man, Jordy Gallagher, and he wrote the song about eight years ago. “Joe, our manager knows him very well and he gave our manager the song to have a listen to because he thought it might suit on the album because it’s a protest song. A lot of those songs from years ago are all protest songs, from the s.“We grew up with all these protest years ago. There was a great song years ago called The Eve of Destruction, and it’s about what would happen to ussomeone dropped the big bomb – we grew up with those songs. So this song really suits the album.”“The Day’s Gonna come is a great song,” Eddie concurred. “The song tells you what’s happening to the world and those older songs tell you what was happening at that time. The words are ‘the day is gonna come when the water runs out and the wells run try, man’s so dumb, fish can’t swim and birds can’t fly’.”He continued: “There’s also peace songs, love songs, and drinking songs. “We’ve sang an awful lot of love songs over the years too. Songs that our mother used to sing and our father used to sing, Sweet Sixteen and that sort of stuff.”Although it’s an anniversary album, the new CD is new territory for The Fureys, who had not previously recorded much of its material. But much like their previous albums, The Fureys have continued to record songs from some of world’s best songwriters.“The songs are mostly from people we’ve met over the years on our tours,” Eddie said.“We’ve sang a lot of great ballads over the years.“We even recorded an album of Charlie Chaplin songs. Josie, Charlie Chaplin’s second youngest daughter, was cleaning out her father’s house and she found five songs that were never recorded before, written by Charlie Chaplin, and she asked uswe would do the songs. We had to do them, and we had to do them with an orchestra. We had a -piece orchestra in the studio with us recording these great songs.”George added: “We do a mix of stuff – not just Irish songs. If you listen to some of the bands now they’re going back on the old stuff. To me, you can’t beat the real thing.”Unlike some older musicians and music fans, The Fureys are not consumed with thoughts of past ‘glory days’. On the contrary, George admits that music is “probably more versatile now”. Instead the past only serves to make their current concerts more fulfilling as they bring together people who have followed them through the generations.“A lot of the kids that come to see us now, their grandparents or parents would’ve come to our concerts and bought our albums,” George said. “Now we have kids coming to concerts with their grandma and grandpa.”Eddie noted: “People grew up with our stuff and they love to see it live.”The Fureys have united generations and their music has been played everywhere from their hometown in Dublin to the International Space Station – where astronaut Chris Hadfield famously played their track ‘Steal Away’ – but of all other places outside of their hometown, it’s in Belfast where they feel most at home.“We’ve been up here so many times it’s like our second home,” George insisted.“We used to play in the Ulster Hall before this was built. We used to bring the wives up to do the Christmas shopping, because it was cheaper up here. Then we’d smuggle it across the border. If you got caught at customs they’d take it off you – drink and everything – party time. We had some parties like.”He continued: “This is our tenth gig here, which I never knew until this morning. It was only opened up when we first played here. They know what to expect – people are used to coming to see us. They always ask for some of the old songs, and we have to do them. People will ask for some dferent songs too, and we can do them no problem.”Eddie added: “We’ll be singing some songs off the new album too. You have to add them in here and there. If a request comes up for an old song we like to keep people happy.”The Furey’s play at the Waterfront Hall on January , .

Jon Tonge: Tory no confidence vote solved nothing - just a spectator sport for the DUP Suzanne Breen: May still needs DUP support but while Brexit backstop remains she won’t have it She immediately faced calls to resign from Brexit-backing MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg, who said that she had lost the confidence of more than one-third of her MPs and a majority of backbenchers.Speaking in Downing Street moments after the result was announced, Mrs May acknowledged that a \"signicant\" number of her MPs had voted against her and said: \"I have listened to what they said.\"She pledged to seek \"legal and political assurances\" on the Brexit backstop to allay MPs concerns about her withdrawal agreement when she attends a European Council summit in Brussels today.Last night the BBC reported that EU leaders are considering making a commitment to continue negotiating a trade deal with the UK eventhe Irish backstop comes into force.It was reported that the move aims to reassure the House of Commons that the backstop will be a temporary measure - although it would not be legally binding.It is believed this would be the start of a two-stage reassurance process starting immediately, with officials working on more drafts to be published in January.Mrs May also said she and her administration had a \"renewed mission\", adding: \"Following this ballot, we now need to get on with the job of delivering Brexit for the British people and building a better future for this country.\"But Mr Rees-Mogg said Mrs May should resign \"as soon as the Queen has a moment in her diary to see her\".The chairman of the European Research Group of Tory eurosceptics told the BBC: \"Its a terrible result for the Prime Minister.\"With the \"payroll vote\" of ministers, parliamentary aides and trade envoys all likely to have backed Mrs May, a majority of the remaining - backbenchers voted no confidence in her, he said.But other Brexiteers said they would end their efforts to unseat Mrs May.Nadine Dorries said: \"The PM has secured the confidence of the Parliamentary party tonight. Its not the way I voted, however I will fully respect the result.\"It was Mrs Mays decision to pull a vote on her deal in the face of what she acknowledged would have been a heavy defeat earlier this week which sparked a new wave of letters of no-confidence from Tories, triggering the challenge to her position.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that the \"dismal\" deal should be put before MPs next week.\"The Prime Minister has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and she is unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first,\" Mr Corbyn said.\"Its clear that she has not been able to negotiate the necessary changes in Europe.\"She must now bring her dismal deal back to the House of Commons next week so Parliament can take back control.\"Labour MPs described Mrs May as a \"lame duck\" due to her decision to pre-announce her departure.Mrs May said after the result: \"While delivering Brexit is important, we also need to focus on the other issues that people feel are vital to them and matter to them today. The issues that we came into politics to deal with, building a stronger economy, delivering first-class public services, building the homes that families need.\"We owe it to the people who put us here to put their priorities first. So here is our renewed mission: delivering the Brexit that people voted for, bringing the country back together and building a country that truly works for everyone.\"Mrs Mays victory in the vote means that another challenge cannot be mounted against her position as Tory leader for a year.But she still faces the danger of a no-confidence motion in the Commons, which could bring her Government downbacked by more than half of all MPs.Addressing MPs at a meeting of the  Committee moments before the crucial vote, Mrs May said she accepted she could not fight the next election as leader.Solicitor general Robert Buckland told reporters: \"She said, In my heart I would like to lead the party into the next election and then that was the introductory phrase to her indication that she would accept the fact that would not happen, that is not her intention.\"And, according to MPs at the meeting, she also promised to find a \"legally-binding solution\" to ensure that the UK does not get permanently trapped in a backstop arrangement."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Of course we are ready to make concessions to Theresa May where possible,” he said.“It is our goal to find a settlement which works for both sides and is capable of securing a majority in both the European and British parliaments.”A Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed that it was the Government’s aim to hold the vote in the Commons “as soon as possible in January”.I recognise the strength of concern in the House of Commons and thats what I will be pushing to colleagues todayTheresa MayFacebookTwitterThe vote had been due to take place on Tuesday, but was dramatically pulled after the whips warned the Prime Minister she was heading for a heavy defeat unless she delayed.The move was met with anger on all sides, prompting a further flurry of letters from Conservative MPs which triggered Wednesday’s no confidence vote.While Mrs May said she was “grateful” to those MPs who backed her, with more than a third of the parliamentary party calling for her to go, she accepted their concerns had to be addressed.“My focus now is on ensuring that I can get those assurances that we need to get this deal over the line, because I genuinely believe it’s in the best interests of both sides – the UK and the EU,” she said.“But I recognise the strength of concern in the House of Commons and that’s what I will be pushing to colleagues today.“I don’t expect an immediate breakthrough, but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.”In a last minute change to the summit arrangements, the Prime Minister was addressing the EU leaders and taking their questions on Brexit at the end of opening session on Thursday.She will then leave while the remaining  discuss their response over dinner.PM @Theresa_May is in Brussels at @EUCouncil — starting by meeting the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pic fgUVGTyD— UK Prime MinisterDecember , Arriving in Brussels, EU leaders indicated their willingness to help Mrs May through “clarications” to the Brexit deal, but were adamant they would not re-open negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met Mrs May in Berlin on Tuesday, said: “I do not see that this Withdrawal Agreement can be changed.“We can discuss whether there should be additional assurances, but here the  member states will act very much in common and make their interests very clear.”French President Emmanuel Macron said: “We cannot reopen a legal agreement, we can’t renegotiate something which has been negotiated over several months. We can have a political discussion in this context.”Irish premier Leo Varadkar, who held a y one-to-one meeting with Mrs May ahead of the main summit, said she had to honour her commitments on the backstop, intended to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.“As the European Union, we are very keen to offer explanations, assurances, clarications, anything that may assist MPs to understand the agreement and hopefully to support it but the backstop is not on the table,” he said.In particular, he insisted there could be no “unilateral exit clause” as some MPs are demanding amid concerns that the UK could be tied to EU customs arrangementsthe backstop is activated.“If the backstop has an expiry date,there is a unilateral exit clause, then it is not a backstop. That would be to render it inoperable,” he said.“That would mean reopening the substance of the Withdrawal Agreement and the European Union is unequivocal that is not an option.”Reports from Brussels suggested EU leaders were considering a draft document stating the bloc “stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided” to the UK on the backstop.It said thatthe backstop was ever activated, the EU would seek to ensure it “would only be in place for a short period and only as long as strictly necessary”.But such assurances are unlikely to satisfy hardline Brexiteers who have been demanding the backstop is dropped altogether."},{"url":null,"title":"my whole world fell apart jim donegans widows words of anguish","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is also a member of Victoria Park and Tower Hamlets AC which won the South of England Athletic Association Fell Running Championships on the Isle of Wight in September, with Aaron winning the inidual title. These championships comprise three races in two days, with the first two races on Saturday and the third and longest, on Sunday.The races are not by any means easy inidually, or collectively, the first being .k, but with an ascent of  metres, the second k with an ascent of  metres and the third, on the following day, k with a m ascent.Aaron was first and second respectively in the first two of the races and he calculated that he could win overallhe finished in fourth place in the third race on Sunday morning.His eventual third place left him overall winner and as he said afterwards: ldquoIt was a beautul setting and some very hard racing, good mental preparation for the XC season coming up. How prophetic that was.To further emphasise his versatility, he ran the Amsterdam Half Marathon on October  and came home in ninth place, posting a superb .. which would have placed him fourth in the recent Belfast Half and sixth in the Waterside Half in Derry, so, he is a top quality runner over all terrains.Juniors at CookstownLauren Madine was the only female from the club juniors to take part in and duly won the U- girlsrsquo race at the Cookstown venue and ever-dependable Mackenzie Murray was the only boy from the club in the U- boysrsquo race, and while he found the going tough, hersquos learning by the week and I am confident that hersquoll develop into a top class runnerFirst points for ladiesEast Down ladies were much better represented than the men as they fielded a team of six and were more than pleased to place fth overall and to register their first place points of the current league campaign.The team scorers were Catherine OrsquoConnor , Niamh Kellett , Deirdre Weatheralland Clare Carsongiving a total of  points. Asto emphasise the importance of overtaking everyone possible, right to the very end, that total was matched by Acorns AC, but because their fourth scorer had finished higher than the East Down fourth-paced runner, Acorns get the better team position.In truth, the third-placed team had only six points less than either Acorns or EDAC, so with a few extra places it could so easily have been third place. But the EDAC squad are delighted with their achievement anyway. The other two participation point scorers were Janine Murray and Ella Carroll.Tough in LanzaroteRising star Gordy Graham headed for the sun in Lanzarote to make his latest marathon effort and with typical cussedness, the weather promptly stuck two fingers up at him by providing a strong headwind on the out and back course, the sting in the tail being that it was in the homeward half.

Jodi Foster and her sister Kari from Spa Primary School and Erin Moore from St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Saul, finished as the top  qualiers outside the qualying teams.Alex Robinson was not so fortunate for the boys and after a slow start, he could not find his way far enough through the traffic in a field of over  runners to take a qualying position.This weekend will see the EDAC Juniors on the road again as they travel to participate in the All-Ireland Uneven Age Group Cross-Country Championships at Navan Racecourse.The seniors have an equally dficult and y journey to participate in the North West Cross-Country in Gransha Park, Derry, but at least they only have to run k when they get there.To paraphrase an old First World War marching song: ldquoItrsquos a long trip to run in Derry.And itrsquos unique too in that everyone runs together, men, women, older men and women and junior men and women.

We just set about formalising a programme in earnest back in .ldquoOur programme works so well it is held up as a model for other schools across Northern Ireland to learn from and to embed its principles into their schools.Mr Moore says there is a fundamental dference between shared education and integration.ldquoThe main dference is that each school can hold on to their faith and culture but still be able to reach out in other aspects of the curriculum.ldquoOur parent teacher associations, for example, have been working together for some time. And on other levels we pull our resources too.Mr Moorersquos views were echoed by Mr Paul Coulter, his counterpart at St Patrickrsquos, who said the idea for shared education came from parents at both schools.Mr Coulter said that demand had grown over the years and that the schools were pulling their resources to fund shared experiences, such as educational trips.ldquoWhen you talk to the children you will see that they are really excited about coming together. Many strong friendships have been formed.Mrs Helen McEvoy, Shared Education co-ordinator at St Patrickrsquos, says the programme has given children the opportunity to come together and take part in learning together.She added: ldquoThe vision for the programme is to enhance the learning of all pupils in an environment where there is equal opportunity, good relations and mutual respect fostered, while at the same time acknowledging dferences and celebrating them.The Recorder met children from both schools last Thursday morning when they busy designing a new logo for their Shared Education Programme.Ten year-old Mya McCurry, who attends St Patrickrsquos Primary School, said she wasnrsquot able to see any dferences between pupils and teachers at both schools.ldquoWe started doing this programme when I was in P, she remarked. ldquoI am in P now. Itrsquos really fun and I look forward to having my friends from Ballynahinch Primary School coming here or visiting them at their school.ldquoTo be honest we were friends before we began getting together in school. I would have played with them on our street sometimes. Now we get together in school too and its terric fun.Leon Rose, a P pupil at Ballynahinch Primary School, revealed that taking part in the Shared Education Programme has helped him become less shy.He said: ldquoI enjoy it a lot and we maintain the friendships we make outside of school too.Also taking part in the programme is Patrick Pillitteri, a P pupil at St Patrickrsquos. Eager to reveal the best thing about shared education he said it was the trips they got to go on.He added: ldquoMy favourite trip was to the Kingspan Stadium at Ravenhill. Irsquom not big into rugby but this was something . It was a fabulous big stadium and it holds many thousands.ldquoIrsquom more of a soccer fan myself. I love Liverpool and I donrsquot ever see that changing any time soon. By the way, Liverpool beat Burnley - last night. That may not seem important to you, but it sure is to me.It came as no surprise then to learn that Patrick wants to be a Premier League footballer when he grows up.He said: ldquoIrsquom going to play for Liverpool when Irsquom older. I get lots of practice in with my friends from Ballynahinch Primary. Finlay and Leon are my best friends in this programme.Animal lover Becky Martin is in P at Ballynahinch Primary. She said the best thing about being part of the programme was organising and planing activities together.ldquoWe have been to Castleward, W and, as Patrick has said, we went to the Kingspan Stadium. There have been loads of trips.ldquoI love organising events. Together we agree on what we would like to do and see it through to the end.When asked what she hoped to do when she grew up, she said: ldquoI love animals but being a vet would make me sad. I would have to put animals to sleep and I wouldnrsquot like that. I think I would like to be a professional dog walker or groom dogs and cats when Irsquom older.Becky added: ldquoThe boys and girls from St Patrickrsquos Primary School bring lots of energy with them.

Barry wants to create something that feels a bit safer and is more bespoke, somewhere a person with a learning disability and their friends and family can all get together and have a good time.She said that she was able to tap into Barryrsquos natural love of disco and music by chance over a year ago.ldquoBarry has always loved discos and hersquos always held discos for us as a family.

I just want to get out of the house more, said Barry. ldquoI started doing disco years and years ago. I just love music and this is going to be so great.Susan paid tribute to Alison Lyttle, Autisim Initiativersquos community engagement manager, who has been instrumental in helping to support the event, as well as Newry, Mourne and Down District Council who contributed to start-up costs.The Black Moon disco will be held at Diamond Pats in Central Promenade, Newcastle, tonight from -pm.

I would prefer that this matter was championed by Ulster GAA and the GAA nationally to improve the coverage of our games.

The images represented all that should not be about the GAA.ldquoPhysical violence has no place in our games or indeed at any level in our association. The fact that they might take place within the confines of GAA property is not excuse for acceptance of and turning a blind eye to such incidents.ldquoIf these incidents were happening on a public street after a Saturday night out they would be deemed to be assault and grievous bodily harm. They would lead to prosecutions and possible sentencing all of which can have a huge impact on the le of the victim and the transgressor. Someone will get badly hurt in some of these incidentsthey are to continue at our grounds.Mr McAteer adds: The one punch message has been part of a campaign by the GAA and the authorities in recent times and it is a very real message. Facts are that one punch could kill and that is in honesty something none of us would ever dare to dream of happening at a GAA game, but reality is that it could.

\"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valMPs have accused the government of #coasting# on its plans for the future of the Northern Ireland fishing industry after Brexit.The Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee at Westminster has written to Fisheries Secretary Michael Gove to outline specic concerns.These included a “crushing” shortage of workers, illegal oyster farming in Lough Foyle, and the suspension of fishing rights in inland waters in the Irish Republic.The MPs on the committee said they are disappointed with the government’s response to an inquiry into the future of the industry here.Committee chairman Andrew Murrison said: “The government is coasting on its plans for Northern Ireland’s fisheries post-Brexit.“Key challenges remain unsolved such as the crushing shortage of labour, illegal oyster farming in Lough Foyle and Ireland’s continued suspension of fishing rights under the Voisinage Arrangement.”On the shortage of manpower, the committee recommended “a time limited immigration concession for non-EU fishing crew” and “a new visa pathway for the crewing of fishing boats by non-EU nationals” as a more long-term solution.The committee also stresses the need for “timescales” to be introduced “immediately” to resolve long-standing issues such as the territorial claims on Lough Foyle.The Foyle sits between Co Londonderry in Northern Ireland and Co Donegal in the Republic and has been a disputed territory since  with both the UK and Irish governments laying claim to it as part of its territory.It criticises the lack of urgency on the suspension of the Voisinage Arrangement – a long-standing agreement permitting fishing vessels from Northern Ireland and Ireland reciprocal access to each other’s territorial waters.“The government has ignored the committee’s suggested deadlines and instead simply reiterated that it is working towards resolution of these issues,” the committee said.The committee also said it was “encouraged” by work on securing the future of Lough Neagh eel fishing.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of course we are ready to make concessions to Theresa May where possible, he said.ldquoIt is our goal to find a settlement which works for both sides and is capable of securing a majority in both the European and British parliaments.A Downing Street spokeswoman confirmed that it was the Governmentrsquos aim to hold the vote in the Commons ldquoas soon as possible in January.The vote had been due to take place on Tuesday, but was dramatically pulled after the whips warned the Prime Minister she was heading for a heavy defeat unless she delayed.The move was met with anger on all sides, prompting a further flurry of letters from Conservative MPs which triggered Wednesdayrsquos no confidence vote.While Mrs May said she was ldquograteful to those MPs who backed her, with more than a third of the parliamentary party calling for her to go, she accepted their concerns had to be addressed.ldquoMy focus now is on ensuring that I can get those assurances that we need to get this deal over the line, because I genuinely believe itrsquos in the best interests of both sides ndash the UK and the EU, she said.ldquoBut I recognise the strength of concern in the House of Commons and thatrsquos what I will be pushing to colleagues today.ldquoI donrsquot expect an immediate breakthrough, but what I do hope is that we can start work as quickly as possible on the assurances that are necessary.In a last minute change to the summit arrangements, the Prime Minister was addressing the EU leaders and taking their questions on Brexit at the end of opening session on Thursday.She will then leave while the remaining  discuss their response over dinner.PM @Theresa_May is in Brussels at @EUCouncil mdash starting by meeting the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar pic fgUVGTyDmdash UK Prime MinisterDecember , Arriving in Brussels, EU leaders indicated their willingness to help Mrs May through ldquoclarications to the Brexit deal, but were adamant they would not re-open negotiations on the Withdrawal Agreement.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met Mrs May in Berlin on Tuesday, said: ldquoI do not see that this Withdrawal Agreement can be changed.ldquoWe can discuss whether there should be additional assurances, but here the  member states will act very much in common and make their interests very clear.French President Emmanuel Macron said: ldquoWe cannot reopen a legal agreement, we canrsquot renegotiate something which has been negotiated over several months. We can have a political discussion in this context.Irish premier Leo Varadkar, who held a y one-to-one meeting with Mrs May ahead of the main summit, said she had to honour her commitments on the backstop, intendedto ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.ldquoAs the European Union, we are very keen to offer explanations, assurances, clarications, anything that may assist MPs to understand the agreement and hopefully to support it but the backstop is not on the table, he said.In particular, he insisted there could be no ldquounilateral exit clause as some MPs are demanding amid concerns that the UK could be tied to EU customs arrangementsthe backstop is activated.ldquoIf the backstop has an expiry date,there is a unilateral exit clause, then it is not a backstop. That would be to render it inoperable, he said.ldquoThat would mean reopening the substance of the Withdrawal Agreement and the European Union is unequivocal that is not an option.Reports from Brussels suggested EU leaders were considering a draft document stating the bloc ldquostands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided to the UK on the backstop.It said thatthe backstop was ever activated, the EU would seek to ensure it ldquowould only be in place for a short period and only as long as strictly necessary.But such assurances are unlikely to satisfy hardline Brexiteers who have been demanding the backstop is dropped altogether..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: May delays Commons Brexit showdown until after Christmas article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sinn Fein Cllr Keith Haughian said: “Numerous independent consultations show a dire need to improve facilities in North Lurgan. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly“Time and time again this has been ignored. We believe that this needs addressed urgently by the Chief Executive of ABC council.”Ms Lockhart pointed out that £.m was set aside for both north and south Lurgan community centre provision during the old Craigavon Council with vows to look towards additional funding for expansion and upkeep of the new premises.“There is broad political agreement but unfortunately there would appear to be a leapfrogging of other priorities within the Council. The people of Lurgan deserve community facilities that are fit for purpose and meet the modern day standard. Ms Lockhart has been lobbying the council to repair a failed heating system in the Mourneview Centre. “Whilst this has resulted in two halogen heaters being supplied to heat the mainroom this is only a short term fix and greater investment is required.” .\" title\"Cllr Keith Haughian .\" data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey.

Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before.

The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
