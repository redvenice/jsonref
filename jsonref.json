Out on 10 September, the novel’s contents remain a closely guarded secret – with this year’s judges, chaired by Hay festival director Peter Florence, only saying in their statement: “Spoiler discretion and a ferocious non-disclosure agreement prevent any description of who, how, why and even where. So this: it’s terrifying and exhilarating.”Atwood will be competing with another former winner: Salman Rushdie, nominated this time for Quichotte. Inspired by Don Quixote and published in August, it sees an ageing travelling salesman falling in love with a television star and driving across America to win her hand. Judges called it a “picaresque tour de force of contemporary America, with all its alarms and craziness”.On a longlist packed with big names – but notable for its exclusion of well-received novels by authors including Ian McEwan, Mark Haddon and Ali Smith – Rushdie is one of several British novelists nominated. Alongside him are Jeanette Winterson for Frankissstein, her reinterpretation of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein John Lanchester for his dystopia The Wall Bernadine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other, a verse novel about the lives of black women Max Porter’s Lanny, the story of a missing boy in a commuter town and Deborah Levy’s The Man Who Saw Everything, which will be published next month and slips between time zones in what judges called “a playful and complex structure”.After tensions in previous years over changes to the prize’s rules, widened at the end of 2013 to include US fiction, just one American novelist is featured: Lucy Ellmann. Born in Illinois, the Anglo-American Ellmann moved to England as a teenager, and was picked for Ducks, Newburyport, a 1,000-page monologue from an Ohio homemaker composed almost entirely of a single sentence.The judges said that Ducks, Newburyport was “brilliantly conceived, and challenges the reader with its virtuosity and originality … A cacophony of humour, violence, and Joycean wordplay, it engages – furiously – with the detritus of domesticity as well as Trump’s America.” Ellmann is published by tiny independent press Galley Beggar, which first saw the potential in Eimear McBride’s award-winning bestseller A Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing.The 13-book list also includes Turkish novelist Elif Shafak for 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World, which details the memories of an Istanbul sex worker whose corpse is left in a rubbish bin Irish author Kevin Barry for Night Boat to Tangier, which judges called “a work of crime fiction not quite like any other” and Nigerian author Chigozie Obioma, whose An Orchestra of Minorities is loosely based on the Odyssey.And Mexican-Italian writer Valeria Luiselli is nominated for her first book written in English, Lost Children Archive, which sets a family road trip from New York alongside the journey of a group of Mexican children attempting to cross the border into the US.Just one debut is nominated, from the youngest writer in the lineup: 31-year-old Nigerian-British author Oyinkan Braithwaite’s darkly comic thriller My Sister, the Serial Killer. Shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize, the novel opens as Korede is called on to help her murderous little sister clear up yet another mess. Judges said it was “as skilful, sharp and engaging a debut as any first novelist can produce”, packed with prose “as pointed as a lethal weapon”.All 13 books are “credible winners”, according to Florence. “They imagine our world, familiar from news-cycle disaster and grievance, with wild humour, deep insight and a keen humanity,” he said. “These writers offer joy and hope. They celebrate the rich complexity of English as a global language. They are exacting, enlightening and entertaining.”The Booker longlist was chosen from 151 novels. Alongside Florence, the jurors were Liz Calder, the former publisher and editor, novelist Xiaolu Guo, writer Afua Hirsch and musician Joanna MacGregor. Literary director of the Booker prize foundation Gaby Wood revealed that they had also called in young adult novels, and “books that are sometimes dismissed as ‘commercial’” in their search for the year’s best fiction.The longlist, she said, “shows the incredible range of what’s being written today”. “There are familiar names here writing at the height of their powers, there are young writers of exceptional imagination and daring, there is wit, incisive political thought, stillness and thrill. And there is a plurality that shows the making of literature in English to be a global endeavour.”The prize is supported for the first time this year by Michael Moritz and Harriet Heyman’s charitable foundation Crankstart, rather than the Man Group. The shortlist will be announced on 3 September and the winner revealed at a ceremony in London on 14 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef19e394824079df6aa85af9c4ef7ca75d8ffa9/0_83_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77c954d0eff7f98d09d4ba87f0e89f79","title":"the booker prize 2019 longlist biggest surprise there arent many","story":"Previous winners Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood head the 13 contenders, many of whom are almost as well-establishedThe surprise about this year’s Booker longlist? That for the first time in years, there are few surprises. This is a list dominated by big names, including one author who won the prize almost four decades ago. Salman Rushdie’s Quichotte, published next month, is a picaresque road trip through contemporary America inspired by Don Quixote. Jeanette Winterson also riffs on a classic: Frankissstein is a mashup of Romanticism and cutting-edge technology, exploring gender identity and AI. Deborah Levy gets her third nomination in a row for The Man Who Saw Everything, a wildly original treatment of totalitarianism and desire, while John Lanchester’s The Wall is a controlled dystopia about borders going up in a time of climate crisis.But the biggest name, with the year’s biggest book, is Margaret Atwood: her Handmaid’s Tale sequel The Testaments is under lock and key until publication, set for 10 September. It starts 15 years after the original novel ends and is narrated by three female characters, but “spoiler discretion and a ferocious nondisclosure agreement prevent any description of who, how, why and even where,” say the judges. All they will let slip is that it’s “terrifying and exhilarating”.The decision to admit any novel written in English, and hence US authors from 2014, alongside writers from the Commonwealth, Zimbabwe and Ireland, continues to anger Brits: the fact that there’s only one US writer on this year’s list (and she has joint British citizenship) feels like a riposte to the controversy. Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport, the monologue of a US homemaker at the end of her tether, is also notable for being a 1,000-page single-sentence epic published by a tiny indie press. Two Nigerian authors also make the cut: the previously shortlisted Chigozie Obioma, whose An Orchestra of Minorities is a contemporary twist on the Odyssey, and Oyinkan Braithwaite, whose Lagos crime caper My Sister, the Serial Killer, shortlisted earlier this year for the Women’s prize, is the only debut.Elif Shafak’s books are under government attack in her native Turkey 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World is a humane but hard-hitting novel capturing the final thoughts of a dying sex worker in Istanbul. Mexican-born Valeria Luiselli’s Lost Children Archive is only her first novel to be written in English it is a timely, hugely impressive work that contrasts a New York family’s road trip south with the desperate journeys of the thousands of migrant children travelling north towards the US border. Irish author Kevin Barry is included for his linguistically exuberant and blackly comic Night Boat to Tangier, in which two ageing gangsters on a hopeless mission spar, squabble and look back on their misspent lives.In a list dominated by established authors, Max Porter is a rising star: Lanny, the polyphonic tale of an unusual little boy in an English village, twines deep time and contemporary life with a lexical playfulness that sets the words literally dancing up and down the pages. Bernardine Evaristo, meanwhile, is an author coming into her own: Girl, Woman, Other, the intermingling stories of generations of black British women told in a gloriously rich and readable free verse, will surely be seen as a landmark in British fiction. Perhaps there are surprises yet to come, starting with the shortlist on 3 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39c944e5ee6033748516927fee85567764c9d9f/0_212_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743597e82b4e67544171829ffa84d15e","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First, a surprising reading experience for BMacLean:Over the past year or so, I’ve been reading on and off an Oxford paperback collection of Mallarmé’s poems. After not having looked at it the last few months, I picked it up again about a week ago and continued from where’d I’d left off.Much to my surprise, I found the poems in this middle section of the book noticeably more straightforward and easy to follow compared to my previous experience with this poet, notoriously oblique and difficult to interpret. “He must have drastically changed his approach to writing after a certain point in his life,” I thought, “Or no, wait - I must be getting smarter!”Much pleased and encouraged, I carried on with renewed enthusiasm. It wasn’t until a few days later that I noticed I wasn’t reading Mallarmé at all – it was an Oxford paperback Verlaine with a similar cover.The Past by Tessa Hadley has provoked lonelybloomer to ask some difficult questions:What can be as good as The Past by Tessa Hadley? I love a novel where a bunch of people have gathered in a remote home to vacation for a month or so, and to stir some old pains and quarrels. Can anyone recall this plot, done as nicely as Hadley’s book?Wow. A cross between Elmore Leonard and Neil Gaiman. Can’t quite believe she’s South African, by which I mean her grasp of US reality (Detroit), her rendering of the speech rhythms is pitch perfect.Vassily Grossman’s Life and Fate has impressed Bloreheath:A really great novel, in the classic Russian mould. One thing, among many, Russian writers could do was somehow to lend importance to persons who may initially seem perfectly ordinary — which may indeed mean most of us. No gimmicks here, none of what Angus Wilson called “the high jinks of experimentalism”, just wonderful straight writing.Offshore by Penelope Fitzgerald has received a gold start from safereturndoubtful:Set in 1962 in Battersea Reach on the Thames the story is of the residents of permanently moored boats, considered by house dwellers then as being somewhat strange. The focus is on Nenna and her two daughters as she considers the future for her and the girls estranged from her husband and the children not attending school. She confides in Maurice, another boat-dweller, also male prostitute and storer of stolen goods. I’ve a favourite few pages when the Austrian boy, Heinrich, visits. A novella with a huge amount crammed in, Fitzgerald’s character development sneaks up on you, so much so that after only a few pages you feel you know the boat folk well. There’s occasional bursts of humour, that are even better appreciated when re-read, and an abrupt ending that may not surprise, but is extremely rewarding.A View From The Foothills by Chris Mullin has provided good bedtime reading for greenmill:It’s late 1999 and Mullin is a junior minister in John Prescott’s environment etc department. Mullin’s deadpan, self-deprecating humour is a delight. He is also generous to others (even some Tories) and is warming to Prescott despite his boss’s complete lack of management skills as he glimpses the fundamentally decent human being which lurks beneath the motor-mouth exterior. He quotes Simon Hoggart in the  reporting on a Prescott speech at that year’s Labour Party Conference “he announced the creation of two new National Parks in the way you might announce the annexation of the Sudetenland”.And pubbore “finally” got round to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury:Absolutely brilliant and scarily prescient of course, but I’m more affected by Bradbury’s afterword: ‘the fire chief in mid-novel says it all, predicting the one-minute TV commercial with three images per second and no respite from the bombardment. Listen to him, know what he says, then go sit with your child, open a book and turn the page.’If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

However. it has said it will not set dates until after further talks with the airline, which intends to take its case to the court of appeal.Balpa’s general secretary, Brian Strutton, said: “Although legally clear to do so, we have still not set any strike dates to give BA one last chance to commit to negotiating on pilots pay and rewards with us at Acas later this week.”He added: “The company itself has admitted that even one day of strike action would cost more than what our pilots are asking for, so the ball really is in their court here, to look after their pilots and ensure the hardworking public get to continue their holidays as planned.”A BA spokesman said the airline remained open to talks, adding: “We are very disappointed with today’s decision. We will continue to pursue every avenue to protect the holidays of thousands of our customers this summer.”Pilots had sought an above-inflation pay settlement that would also include a profit share scheme, reflecting their argument that they took pay cuts when BA was struggling in the wake of the financial crisis and that they should share in the benefit now that the business has recovered. BA provided the largest share of parent company IAG’s €2.9bn (£2.6bn) pretax profit in 2018.Planned strikes by thousands of airport workers could also affect holiday flights and bring disruption to Heathrow airport, BA’s main base, this summer, with a series of walkouts starting on Friday.The airport’s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, accused Unite on Tuesday of calling the strikes to “flex its muscles”. He added that Unite had deliberately targeted the first weekend after most state schools have broken up, Heathrow’s busiest period.He said: “People will see longer queues through security but we are focused on getting as many hardworking families on their way as we can, regardless of this completely unnecessary strike.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a46f58692d2fae1f8f2130fe8024f3e32b99a8/0_273_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4efd580866062c949ce987630705e8db","title":"caledonian sleeper staff vote strike action stress","story":"RMT union says workers have been ‘paying personal price’ for introduction of new fleetCaledonian Sleeper staff have voted for strike action, claiming “intolerable” and “appalling” working conditions after the botched rollout of its £150m fleet of sleek trains.The new generation of overnight sleeper trains, billed as a hotel on wheels, have been plagued by problems since being unveiled in April.The RMT union said morale has sunk to an “all-time low”, with staff suffering from workplace stress and mental health issues.Issues raised in the dispute with Serco, which has run the Caledonian Sleeper franchise between London and Scotland since 2015, include insufficient staffing levels, lack of training and an “unresponsive” management regime.“Our members on the Caledonian Sleeper are sick and tired of paying the personal price for the botched introduction of the new fleet,” said Mick Cash, the general secretary at the RMT. “That is why they have delivered this overwhelming vote for action.”The vote also includes the option of taking industrial action short of a strike.The upgraded trains, which were partly funded by the Scottish government, feature double beds and en suite bathrooms and were heralded as giving a luxury overnight journey for passengers, with a double en suite priced from £400.However, on a disastrous first night in April, north and southbound trains rolled in hours late, beset with problems including signalling glitches, a delayed driver and onboard calamity ning accommodation mix-ups and catering blunders to leaking cabins.Since then, technical faults with the trains have led to a number of overnight services being cancelled or curtailed, leaving passengers stranded until morning. The Caledonian Sleeper’s punctuality is the worst of any UK train operator.The company has delayed new trains that were set to be rolled out on the scenic Highlands routes to Fort William and Inverness until after summer.Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper, said: “We’re deeply disappointed by the result of the ballot. I believe we have shown a real commitment to dealing with the issues the RMT has raised and indeed there was an acceptance on all sides that progress was being made.“We remain open and willing to engage in further talks to avoid industrial action and are fully committed to delivering the best possible service to guests.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d1f8c3037ef54c87944220b116e5b65d948754/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0a3af26674bff07f20dd0ee2c54453","title":"deutsche bank posts worst quarterly loss in four years","story":"German lender counts cost of plan to cut 18,000 jobs as it records €3.1bn shortfallDeutsche Bank has made its biggest quarterly loss in four years as it counts the costs of plans to reduce its global workforce by 18,000.The German lender made a €3.1bn (£2.8bn) net loss in the second quarter, driven by €3.4bn in costs related to job cuts and reorganisation at the bank.Deutsche Bank expects the turnaround plans to cost a total of €7.4bn and is aiming to return to profit next year.It is the bank’s biggest quarterly net loss since the third quarter of 2015, when that figure reached €6bn, and is the second largest since the final months of 2008, when the financial crisis took hold.It also follows a €201m profit in the first quarter of 2019.Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank announced the plans to cut about a fifth of its 91,500-strong global workforce by 2022. It embarks on a period of global expansion, beginning with the acquisition of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell in the UK and other European markets such as Spain, where it buys Banco de Madrid. It consolidates its US operations into one, in an effort to take on the big beasts of Wall Street such as Goldman Sachs, and in 1999 it builds on its US foothold by snapping up New York-based Bankers Trust for $10bn.Deutsche Bank\u0026nbspfloats on the New York Stock Exchange, cementing its position as one of the major players, not just on Wall Street but in global banking.Deutsche Bank becomes a leader in mortgage-backed securities, bundling up homeowners’ debt into huge packages and selling them on to investors. The bank continues to sell toxic mortgage-based investments even as the market turns south and it begins betting against such products itself. The bank reports its first annual loss for five decades for the 2008 financial year, losing €3.9bn.An internal investigation finds that the bank hired private detectives to spy on people it considered a threat – including a shareholder, a journalist and a member of the public. German prosecutors find no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or that senior executives were involved.It is fined $2.5bn (£1.7bn) by US and UK regulators for rigging the Libor interest rate, ordered to fire seven employees and accused of being obstructive towards regulators. Joint chief executives Anshu Jain and Jürgen Fitschen\u0026nbspresign in the wake of the Libor scandal. The bank is\u0026nbspfined a further $258m\u0026nbspin the US for doing business with US-sanctioned countries like Iran and Syria.As regulators continue to sift through the wreckage of the banking crash, Deutsche takes a large slice of the blame. In September 2016, its shares slump on news that the institution\u0026nbspfaces a $14bn (£10.5bn) charge\u0026nbspover mis-selling mortgage securities in the US. It eventually reaches a $7.2bn settlement with the US Department of Justice.UK and US regulators\u0026nbspfine Deutsche more than $630m (£506m)\u0026nbspafter finding that the lender failed to prevent $10bn of Russian money laundering via \u0027mirror trades\u0027, which had no economic purpose and served only to transfer money covertly.New York financial regulators hand down a fresh fine, just $205m this time, for \u0027lax oversight\u0027 in the bank’s foreign exchange business when it was the world’s largest dealer in foreign currency.Christian Sewing takes over as chief executive and after three consecutive years of heavy losses, he\u0026nbspslashes 7,000 jobs\u0026nbspfrom Deutsche’s bloated investment banking arm.Over the past two and a half weeks, more than 900 employees have either been handed their notice or told their role will be eliminated.

These are reflected in our results.“A substantial part of our restructuring costs is already digested in the second quarter.

Nissan is expected to announce the cuts officially on Thursday when the company reports what is expected to be its worst quarterly results in more than a decade.The manufacturer, which in May announced it would cut 4,800 jobs from its global workforce of about 139,000, has about 8,000 employees in the UK.The cuts are expected to fall mainly in factories outside Japan and will increase fears of job losses at Nissan’s operation in Sunderland, the UK’s largest car plant.Workers are already facing uncertainty after Nissan in March cancelled the production of two luxury Infiniti models, part of its plans to pull out of the premium car market in western Europe.That decision followed Nissan’s shock announcement to build its new X-Trail in Japan. The company had previously chosen Sunderland for the X-Trail after initially receiving pledges of more than £80m in government help. This offer was later reduced to £61m.Japanese media reported that the job cuts were likely to hit factories in South America and other regions where Nissan has low profitability.Nissan has also struggled to improve poor profit margins in the US, the world’s second-biggest automotive market, where years of heavy discounting to try to drive sales has hurt its brand image and bottom line.A spokesman for Nissan said the company did not comment on speculation. The cuts were first reported by the Japanese news agency Kyodo.Nissan has been hit by a fall in sales in the US and Europe and is still reeling after the arrest of former boss Ghosn on financial misconduct charges.Nissan reported net profits of 319bn yen ($2.9bn) for the year to the end of March, the lowest amount since 2009-10 when the company was struggling in the wake of the global financial crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0a23943b1efde3721d382ea2a25273b6855493/0_0_4457_2674/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=906f1ed16f7b3420b02384cb61b2d65a","title":"theme parks pubs and human zoos how the victorians invented leisure","story":"Entrepreneurs came up with increasingly elaborate ways to part Londoners from their money, inventing many staples of the modern leisure industry Whether it was visiting a “human zoo”, taking a bull on a hot-air balloon ride, or singing risqué songs about rhubarb, Victorian Londoners loved to have fun.As entrepreneurs and impresarios came up with increasingly elaborate ways to make money from the capital’s huge potential audience, Victorians effectively invented the modern leisure industry – including theme parks, pubs and professional football.As a new book by historian Lee Jackson explains, the hunt for profit took place against the backdrop of typical Victorian concerns surrounding morality, class and empire. So where did Victorians go for fun? And what still exists today?You probably won’t hear the music hall classic Pulling My Rhubarb Out at Wilton’s these days but this back-street Wapping theatre is one of the few Victorian music halls still standing. Wilton’s was built in 1859, as grand purpose-built music halls began to appear in London following changes in licensing laws. Crowds loved the mix of smutty and sentimental songs, as well as slapstick, circus performers and black face minstrels.InBy the 1860s, music halls were drawing crowds twice as large as the old West End theatres, whose owners launched various countermeasures – including downright duplicitous manipulation of licensing loopholes – to get their rivals closed down. Music halls were also accused of harbouring prostitutes or providing entertainment of a low moral and intellectual calibre, which is precisely what made them so popular.Over time, proprietors closed their bars and toned down the acts so that by 1912, music hall was deemed acceptable even for royalty. That’s when George V attended the Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. At Wilton’s you can still see a mix of theatre, comedy and music – and there’s also a great bar.It’s now a building site near Leicester Square, but when the Argyll Rooms lost its licence in 1878, there was a riot. Drunken medical students were so incensed at the closure of their favourite haunt they took to the streets and, urged on by cheering prostitutes, hurled firecrackers at the police. That gives you an idea of the sort of crowd that used to frequent the Argyll Rooms, the West End’s premier and most dissolute dance hall.A dance craze hit London in the 1840s, and a number of dancing rooms – or casinos – were opened, including Laurent’s Casino off the Strand. This was London’s first night-club, and it later transferred to the Argyll Rooms on Shaftesbury Avenue, taking over a space that had previously been used as a museum, automaton show and indoor “centrifugal railway” – a primitive rollercoaster complete with loop-the-loop. The proprietor was Bob Bignell, a West End bookmaker, who saw money in the dancing trend. His club soon attracted crowds out for a good time – too much so for the authorities, leading to its eventual shutdown.The Argyll closed as the dance fad came to an end, and Bignell turned the space into the Trocadero music hall. It kept that name through the 20th century when it was transformed into one of London’s naffest tourist attractions. The site currently awaits development into a hotel.One of the most distinctive features of the handsome Prince Alfred pub in Maida Vale is the panelled iders which you have to duck under to move from bar to bar. These were installed to ensure different classes of customer had their own safe space – and class was a major concern for Victorian moral authorities, who worried that the new forms of mass entertainment were cutting across traditional boundaries.Sumptuous boozers like the Prince Alfred, rich with decorative wood and etched glass, were created to partly address the class issue by making gin-drinking itself respectable – but even then, the different classes needed to know their place.Temperance campaigners were not satisfied. They argued that it was precisely the gorgeousness of the gin palace – the gaslight and gilding, brass fixtures and fittings, large windows, etched glass and mirrors, not to mention the innovation of counter service – that lured more respectable members of the working-class into the sinful public house. Despite such concerns, these would all become standard features of the Victorian pub and remain the defining characteristics of the pubs we use today.A set of wrought iron gates by a riverside park are all that remain of the Cremorne, once one of the most notorious of London’s Victorian pleasure gardens. Stretching from the Kings Road to the Thames, it opened in 1843 and along with the gardens at Vauxhall, Highbury Barn, Walworth and Islington’s Eagle Tavern, catered for thousands of nightly visitors.The average pleasure garden had promenades, bandstands and follies, plus curious performers such as Michael Boai, who played music on his chin, or “the Beckwith frogs”, a family who ate breakfast in an underwater tank. There were elaborate firework displays, including Cremorne’s pyro-boosted pride-restoring recreations of the Crimean War and Indian Mutiny. Another Victorian favourite was the novelty hot-air balloon ascent. At Cremorne, a balloonist called Madame Poitevin took to the air on the back of a bull. The balloon crashed in Ilford and the animal died of shock, causing the RSPCA to get involved.Cremorne was managed by a trio of West End publicans, and became identified with a fast set who would swan down to Chelsea after the theatres had closed, raising hell. Brawls were commonplace, and the gardens were popular with prostitutes and Londoners looking for fun. It closed in 1877, after losing its licence. Pleasure gardens more generally lost their raison d’etre with the establishment of public parks. London’s rapid growth meant the valuable land was usually sold to developers, which is why so little of London’s great pleasure gardens remain.Pleasure gardens were also overshadowed by larger exhibition grounds such as the Crystal Palace, which tried to find a way of balancing entertainment with a hard dose of cultural education. Little physically remains of the Crystal Palace itself, which moved to Sydenham from Hyde Park in 1854, but the grand 200-acre grounds still exist as a public park.The great glass building was used as a sort of showcase for luxury goods but also had zones with fine art, artefacts and historic architecture such as a Roman villa and 50-ft copies of the statues of Ramesses II in Abu Simbel. There were dioramas showing flora and fauna from around the world, complete with models of West Indians and Native Americans. The gardens hosted elaborate entertainments – a race featuring ponies ridden by monkeys was one highlight – as well as plays, operas and pantomimes. There was also a “human zoo” featuring 60 Somalis, transported from Africa to be gawped at by curious South London. The Crystal Palace was destroyed by fire in 1936 but its footprint remains, while you can get a sense of its somewhat haphazard educational ambition through the beloved stone statues of dinosaurs.Other exhibition grounds leant towards more straightforward fun: the Earl’s Court grounds were like a modern theme park, with Ferris wheel, rollercoaster and Buffalo Bill’s cowboy show, albeit with sideshows tailored towards an annual theme, often chosen to attract finance from commercial partners. This was partly the work of impresario Imre Kiralfy, who created fantastic theatrical displays at Kensington’s Olympia such as Venice In London, which combined canals and three-quarter scale gondolas with walkable streets and bridges and working restaurants and cafes. Kiralfy would later open White City, the epitome of the Victorian theme park’s promise to provide both “instruction and amusement”. White City had orientalist architecture, thrilling rides, human zoos (Irish this time) and pavilions sponsored by Moet \u0026amp Chandon all tied together with a thread of education that was increasingly hard to discern amid the ornamental canals and rickety roller-coasters.On the site of the Methodist Central Hall was a short-lived attraction that attempted to transport the seaside to central London. It was railways that made Margate and Southend accessible to Londoners, and some of the leisure activities peculiar to the seaside soon made it back to the capital.One of these was the winter garden, a sort of compact, centralised exhibition ground that day-trippers could visit when it rained. Southport opened the first in 1874 and the concept was transposed in full to Westminster in 1876.Southport’s winter garden offered a promenade through a large tropical conservatory, a basement aquarium complete with crocodiles, games rooms, a concert hall and landscaped gardens with caves, grottoes and ornamental bridges. A skating rink was later added. London’s version, the Royal Aquarium and Winter Garden, was a straight copy, crocodiles excepted. It flopped, and the site was levelled in 1903.Fulham FC, London’s oldest professional football club, still play at their first ground, built by the Victorians in 1896. The oldest parts of the ground are the pavilion and main stand, dating to 1905, and a sign of how popular and financially successful football had become under the Victorians. Although versions of the sport had been around for centuries, it was the Victorians who codified the game and then professionalised it. This led to enclosed grounds where spectators paid for admittance, with the income spent on acquiring new players. The modern game was born.London has many claims to football history. The first trial match under FA rules was played in 1863 at Limes Field, the former home of Barnes FC, since demolished. A second demonstration match took place in Battersea Park. London was also the location of the first FA Cup final, at Kennington Oval in 1872, while finals were also played at Crystal Palace and the since demolished Lillie Bridge in West Brompton.London’s oldest football ground? That’s the Old Spotted Dog in Forest Gate, a former cricket ground that has been home to non-league Clapton FC since 1888.Palaces of Pleasure by Lee Jackson is published by YaleFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3c3e5191b9ab7314ef33b6d8e8512c595efcb4/0_37_6979_4188/master/6979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17929fb80cc07330cf070089f275fcca","title":"hideous and naff are londons new water fountains too ugly","story":"The design of London’s new drinking fountains has been criticised on social media – so which cities have managed to get it right?Last week, the locations of 50 new public drinking water fountains in London were announced. The scheme, a joint venture between Thames Water and the mayor of London which will install 100 in total, aims to encourage people to use refillable water bottles, and cut the consumption of single-use plastics.But while the initiative was welcomed by many, the design of the fountains – a white base with a large blue waterdrop on top – came under fire on social media. The structures have been designed to be easy to spot and able to withstand all weathers. But one Twitter user branded them “naff”, another “hideous” – and historian and broadcaster Tom Dyckhoff tweeted: “Great idea. But these are the UGLIEST things ever designed by humans.”Damning comparisons were made with elegant, ornate, Victorian-era water fountains:However, while historical fountains look impressive, there are practical problems with restoring them, pointed out Jon Burke, cabinet member for energy, waste, transport and public realm at the London Borough of Hackney. He replied: “As part of Hackney’s new water fountain programme we’re bringing historical fountains back into use, but they cost three times to fix (let alone designbuild) than a new one the Victorian ones are often not disability compliant and we’ve lost £130myr from the Gov’t ...”Several years ago, a design challenge in London asked six architecture firms for proposals for new fountains. One architect tweeted “Five years ago I helped judge a competition to design new water fountains for London. Some were more successful than others, but all were better than this.”Meanwhile, people shared photos on Twitter of drinking water fountains in other cities:If you’re having trouble using the form, click here.

But reporting has cast a new light on the controversyShould Al Franken really have fallen on his sword, resigning his Senate seat in December 2017 following a spate of minor sexual impropriety accusations, and mounting pressure from his colleagues? Seven US senators who once thought yes now think no – the Vermont senator Patrick Leahy calls it one of the “biggest mistakes” of his 45-year career. Franken, who no longer has a career and thus plenty of time to cultivate regrets, has come to believe that “differentiating different kinds of behavior is important”.So believes the masterful investigative reporter Jane Mayer too, and she returns to The Case of Al Franken in the latest New Yorker. To cut to the chase: “Almost NOTHING His Main Accuser Said checks out,” as Mayer tweeted about the piece. The accuser in question is Leeann Tweeden, the conservative talkshow host pictured with Franken in a 2006 United Service Organizations (USO) tour photo, she asleep, he leering, outstretched hands a millimeter or so from her chest.Mayer, a dogged unearther of facts, subjects Tweeden’s account of Franken’s supposed harassment to forensic analysis – she even gets her hands on the metadata from the camera – interviewing dozens of people who were on the scene, who worked with Franken, and who were in the know about the orchestration of the photo’s release. She uncovers a series of misstatements, implausibilities, and (no surprise) intimations of a political hit job – names like Roger Stone, Alex Jones and Sean Hannity hover in the background. Tweeden was herself a Trump supporter and a “birther” who’d publicly demanded to see Barack Obama’s birth certificate.Those who think no sexual accusation made by a woman can possibly be untrue, even those by birthers targeting Democrats, will probably remain unimpressed by the new information Mayer reveals. For my part, I find myself wondering what would happen if all the less famous men and women accused of similarly ambiguous crimes– ribaldry gone awry, creeping people out in vaguely sexual ways – had their own Jane Mayers to investigate.As someone who’s written about #MeToo and campus sexual assault, I’m on the receiving end of plenty of such stories (an increasing number of which are from women, by the way). I’m frequently left frustrated and often livid at the absurdity of the accusations and the summary justice that follows. One case that particularly rankled, involving Harris Fogel, formerly a tenured professor of photography at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, actually has some interesting similarities to Franken’s. Though he is hardly as well-known as the former comedian-senator, Fogel’s work is in the collections of the politan Museum of Art in New York and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Like Franken, Fogel was a dispenser of social kisses. He may also have had a “naturally outgoing and joking manner”, according to his lawsuit, that was – given the current state of heterosexual rancor – likewise mistaken for sexual predation.At a photography education conference in Las Vegas in March 2016, Fogel spotted an acquaintance, Jennifer Little, in the conference hotel lobby. Little is a tenured photography professor at a California university, and they’d known each other for several years. Little had asked Fogel for job advice and reference letters in the past. It was daytime. He greeted her with a kiss.In December 2017, 20 months later, came the allegation: Little contacted the Title IX coordinator at UArts, where Fogel taught, asserting that the hotel lobby kiss had been forcible and nonconsensual, though she hadn’t complained about it to Fogel at the time. Indeed, they proceeded to attend various functions together Little even posted some of Fogel’s conference photos of her on her Facebook page.As in Franken’s case, there was soon a second allegation, filed the day after Little’s. This complainant was an aspiring photographer named Anne-Laure Autin, who’d also met Fogel in March 2016, at a different photography conference in Houston. Fogel had been assigned to give Autin a 20-minute informal critique of her portfolio, which took place in the public setting of a hotel ballroom. Afterward, he handed her some literature about the UArts photography program, and reached in his jacket pocket to pull out his business card. Except the card he pulled out wasn’t his business card, it was his hotel-room keycard, which was similar in size. He said: “Here is my business card – oops – my room key.” They both laughed.Although Autin seems to have initially regarded Fogel’s remark as a joke, she later discussed the incident with Little, who was also at the conference, and who disclosed that Fogel had “forced himself physically on her” a few weeks earlier at the previous conference.In receipt of two complaints against Fogel, the university launched an investigation, and in January 2018 – despite the fact that Fogel disputed Little’s account, and the only corroboration of her story was the other complainant, and the two women had clearly conferred on their complaints – determined Fogel had “forcibly” kissed Little and harassed Autin.After a 22-year career, Fogel’s employment was summarily terminated by UArts’ board of trustees without so much as a hearing or a chance for Fogel to respond to the investigator’s report.I suppose most people reading this will be thinking: “There has to be more to it than that!” Well, yes, there were vague allegations that Fogel had engaged in “typical male verbal flirting behavior”, which isn’t the kind of thing that can really be disproven. It also reeks of gender bias. Or perhaps, as might be said of Franken too, the outcome was “political” – Fogel’s lawsuit suggests that he was deemed an obstructionist by his superiors. Who knows? Academic politics are said to be the most vicious kind, though they are vicious all over.To be clear, the details given here on Fogel’s case are the facts alleged in his lawsuit (which a federal judge recently ruled may proceed). I have not independently confirmed or disproved them. That would take the talents of a Jane Mayer, equipped with a New Yorker expense account. However, I’m enough of a crack reporter to note that it was exactly three days after Franken announced he was resigning that Jennifer Little contacted the UArts title IX coordinator, whose subsequent investigation was conducted as the Franken drama was playing out in the national news.Sure, there were plenty of other high-profile cases that winter, though typically not over such trivial stuff. Were Fogel’s accusers tuned into the Franken story? Was the investigator, who, Fogel’s lawsuit alleges, didn’t bother to investigate any potentially exculpatory evidence? In short: did the Franken resignation help lower the bar on what now constitutes harassment and assault?I myself thought at the time that if Franken had actually groped women during photo ops, as was alleged, he was right to resign – jokey photos are one thing, ass-grabbing is another. Mayer’s reporting leaves me less sure – is an arm around someone’s waist really a sexual incursion? But in late 2017, we were all pretty on edge, I think, combing our pasts for dormant memories of assaults and affronts, and there were so many stories – too many to make sense of. It was an off-with-their-heads moment, and for a while that felt great.But there were also opportunists “telling their truths”. There was failed distinction-making and political expediency, and the impossibility of sorting motives from facts. That’s what’s starting to get unraveled now, in deep reporting like Mayer’s, as well as in the courts. Campus findings based on “victim-centric” approaches to sexual misconduct are increasingly being overturned by judges, and employers who were over-hasty with the axe are being forced into settlements.The fallout isn’t going to be pretty, especially as the accused, when permitted, air their side of the story. It’s certainly not going to be unifying. And I suspect there’s plenty more fallout to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0932573866d5823e0fb6ac8be36f56343d386f6/0_553_4662_2797/master/4662.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0a3c61fd44fe483253b00afba39c68","title":"uk combustible led by man plays with matches","story":"As our economy stutters and our politics turns sour, Boris Johnson will be trying to outflank Nigel Farage and the hardcore BrexiteersMe, me, me. That’s always been the bottom line for Boris Johnson, hasn’t it? And it’s what we’re all going to get now. A whole summer season devoted to just one man. His debut speech outside his new home on Downing Street! His first set of ministers to play with! His very own poll bounce!Morsel after marvellous morsel shall be served up in the papers and on TV by Conservative MPs and commentators. For his boosters, there will be the first 100 days of speeches and photo ops, and endless bloviating optimism. For his critics, there will be his vast yellowing back catalogue of falsehoods and flubs. For Johnson, all of them wind around to the same fabulous end: him, him, him.Yes, I do mean combustible. Look at a report last week from Hope Not Hate, a charity that monitors political extremism. It asked more than 6,000 Britons if they would join a campaign to defend Brexit from being reversed. Almost two-thirds of leave voters said they would. Then they were asked: what if that campaign turns violent? Again, almost two-thirds said it wouldn’t put them off. They would happily sit through ugly threats, bloodied faces, broken bones. Some might even join in, because the means can self-justify the ends.My point is not that leave voters are a bunch of vicious brutes while remainers are all cut from the same handloom cloth as Gandhi it is that this is where extreme polarisation of politics and economics, rolled up in the gift-wrap of identity, is taking the country. The fury that some of us spotted while reporting on the 2016 referendum has moved from the saloon bar into the party hustings.“Bit by bit, Brexit is ripping down the firewalls to political violence,” says Cormac Hollingsworth, a Hope Not Hate director. At the hate crime monitoring unit, Tell Mama, Fiyaz Mughal talks of a “market for bigoted ideas that has grown significantly” over the past decade, even as “the middle ground has shrunk”.This is not the UK you were told about. Central to this country’s origin myth is that it doesn’t do violent extremism. Britons never had a revolution, our textbooks inform us, and never swooned over a dictator they preferred tolerance and a cup of tea. It wasn’t entirely true – just ask those massacred at St Peter’s Fields in 19th-century Manchester, or at Jallianwala Bagh in 20th-century Punjab – but it formed the eternal framing for the UK’s self-image. Until yesterday, when it became laughably redundant.As recently as the 2016 EU referendum, leave mastermind Dominic Cummings froze out Nigel Farage and his Ukippers on the grounds that they were too nasty to win the vote. Yet today, Britain will have as its prime minister a Conservative whose chief claim to the job is that he can outflank the Farage army.Add to that rancorous, resentful politics the shockwaves yet to come. Even without a disastrous Brexit, the economy is careering towards recession. The country’s entire business model will have to be reinvented, even while there are barely any politicians or scholars doing the necessary thinking. And then consider what crashing out of the EU without a deal will do to national life. That prospect this spring led to 10,000 riot police being readied to go on the streets.Johnson has been briefed by Whitehall officials that no deal will produce civil unrest and possibly shortages of fresh food and clean water – a briefing that, the Sunday Times reports, left him “visibly shaken”.Let us not waste our time pondering whether the new prime minister is prepared for such historic turbulence. He isn’t. “Do you look daunted? Do you feel daunted?” he asked Tory activists yesterday, expecting a big pantomime-style “No!”, when a quieter, wiser man would have known that the right answer should be yes. This is the most daunting set of circumstances Britain has faced in generations we need a prime minister ready to face up to them.Instead, we have the blond Nero, tousling his hair while the union disintegrates. Last week he promised the party faithful that a Halloween Brexit would not cause a Mars bar shortage. This week he compared leaving the EU to the Apollo landing on the moon. His gift is for rhetoric, not detail. His trademark is moneyed nihilism. At the Foreign Office his lack of preparedness as good as condemned an innocent mother to an indefinite term in an Iranian prison. As London’s mayor he scooped the credit for Ken Livingstone winning the Olympics bid, tried to stay on holiday during the 2011 riots, and spent the rest of his time dreaming up monuments to himself: Boris island airport, the garden bridge.Among the iron laws of history is that when things get tough, some people always get hurt more than others. Among the iron laws of Johnson’s biography is that he always put himself on the side of the bully. Are you a Muslim woman being spat at in the street? Johnson will laugh at you as a letterbox in one of those columns that earns him £275,000 a year. Are you a black person suffering racial abuse? Then enjoy our most famous living Old Etonian joining in with his jibes about “picanninies” and “watermelon smiles”.At times, Johnson sounds like Donald Trump using more syllables. But there is one crucial difference. The US president will happily allow crowds to chant about locking up Hillary Clinton or sending Ilhan Omar back and not care about inciting violence. Trump is after blood. Johnson, one suspects, would prefer a slobbering snog. He just wants to be liked by whoever is in the ascendancy. And the ascendant politician of our age is Farage. It is the man once dubbed a fruitcake by David Cameron who will lead our prime minister further and further into extremism. And it will be a path easy for Johnson to follow, as our politics become ever more sour and our economy heads south.At the moment when the country needs a truth-teller, it has instead an incontinent liar. In one of this country’s darkest hours, we have installed in No 10 the poor man’s Winston Churchill. Except it isn’t a V for victory we see it’s a V-sign that the millionaire manchild is flicking at the rest of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e097333d11a9060b36fd5f696b286df43181dae/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fc239826e57ee5c6d1fafd2d59c23d8","title":"the smell the noise the dust my neighbour the factory farm","story":"Industrial farms are spreading across Europe. Greenpeace campaigners went to talk to the people who live close byWarning: readers may find one of the images below upsettingWhat is life like for people living next door to an industrial-scale livestock farm, and how does it affect their daily lives? Greenpeace campaigners visited animal farms and their surrounding communities in France, Denmark, Spain and Italy between December 2018 and March 2019 to find out.There are more than 330m cows, sheep and pigs in the EU, with a further several billion chickens reared and slaughtered every year. The growth of Europe’s animal farming sector has seen it exceed what scientists have claimed are safe bounds for greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient flows and bioersity loss. This has lead to calls from campaign groups for a halving of meat and dairy production by 2050.Ricardo Antón (below) is known as Ritxi by his neighbours. The 56-year-old runs an organic horticulture farm in Caparroso, Navarre, in northern Spain, which caters for small clients, including two school canteens.“All these big factory farms represent a threat to the ecosystem in the area,” he says. “Also, smaller enterprises can hardly sustain their production.” He says traditional farms – small-scale operations with a ersity of crops and livestock – are disappearing.The owners of the farm plan to build the EU’s biggest dairy factory farm, with more than 23,000 cows in Noviercas, a village of less than 200 inhabitants in Soria, Castilla y León. This new farm was rejected in the regions of Navarre, País Vasco and Cantabria, but the owners have the support of the mayor in Noviercas.Former high school teacher Bente Jørgensen has lived in the village of Tingerup, about 60km west of Copenhagen, with her husband Søren Hansen, a chemical engineer, for more than 20 years. Her home is just 100 metres away from the Vandvaerksgaarden pig farm.Jørgensen says the couple are afraid of being exposed to possible toxic substances, through manure and air. When the smell is strong, Jørgensen wears a face mask outside. “The smell is so awful that it makes me feel sick. My head aches and my eyes are red and swollen. I feel that our lives are destroyed because of the smell, noise and dust from the farm,” she says.Jørgensen enjoys being outside, but she limits her time outdoors because the smell coming from the farm is so bad and she fears the long-term health impacts of her exposure to it. She has to clean her garden fence several times every year because of algae growth, which she believes is fuelled by nitrogen from farm ammonia emissions. Every Thursday, dead pigs are being collected from the farms in the area. Until collection day the neighbours say they often see dead pigs outside the farms. Under Danish law, pigs should be covered and not visible.The primary school in the village of Lescout is located just 500 metres from the egg-laying hen farm of Gallès SAS. First built in the 1980s, it steadily grew and after expanding in 2016 it now keeps 185,000 hens, outnumbering the population of the village more than 250 times over. The owner is planning further expansion after requesting a permit for a new building.“During some mornings, the smell was so corrosive in the throat and nose that for the sake of children’s safety, we preferred to keep them indoors during playtime,” says Cathy Double, a former teaching assistant at the school.The farm is also close to Château du Gua, a historic castle belonging to 57-year-old architect Catherine Gavelle. “I think this type of factory farm should have never been constructed in the first place. There should not be the authorisation to construct an industrial building alongside a village and next to a listed building. This factory farm has affected my life with its visual, its noise and its smell,” she says.Adalgisa Martorelli (below), aged 55, lives in the small village of Cadelbosco, in the Emilia-Romagna region, and suffers from a respiratory illness that, she says, worsens in the presence of strong smell. She has repeatedly been forced to leave her home during manure-spreading by two local pig farms, Azienda Agricola Fontanelle SNC di Ferrari e C and Allevamento Azienda Agricola Tenuta Vincenzo Srl. She has undergone several hospitalisations and sometimes has to use an oxygen mask at home.There is no medical evidence of a link between her illness and farm pollution, but Martorelli says her condition has improved since the second farm stopped spreading manure on the field near her home.Ten years ago, Martorelli created a small local committee together with other inhabitants of the village, which documented sewage spills from the first farm, Azienda Agricola Fontanelle SNC di Ferrari e C, into local waterways. The farm was forced by the local authorities to suspend the spreading of the manure for five years in part of neighbouring fields and reduce the number of pigs on the farm – from 12,500 to 3,899.The farm owners told the  that the alleged sewage spills were due to pipe breaks and a very rare occurrence. They said the reduction of pig numbers was unconnected to the sewage spills, but due to the complaints of the Clean Air Committee. They also said they had been monitoring emissions from the farm, which they claim are below Italian and European averages for pig herds.The second pig farm – owned by Azienda Agricola Tenuta Vincenzo Srl – has been granted permission to expand from 2,000 to 7,000 pigs. Martorelli’s committee is opposing this enlargement. “I’m terrified about the new request for enlargement. If this will be really done, I will probably not be able to live here any longer. I will have to decide to leave my home,” she says.The farm owner Dario Gualini told the  that it had received environmental permissions for the expansion and would be monitoring its impact. “We have adopted the best techniques in the field of animal welfare and the protection from smell and environmental pollution. We are convinced, as the authorities that issued the permits, that our structure will be taken as an example in the future for the best conditions for both animals and humans.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6967e6cd6884185efdcd36714fe6526dc711565/31_142_2210_1326/master/2210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb217b2429686c846b420e35f0199a1f","title":"powerful undersea images photographer roger grace in pictures","story":"The marine biologist, conservationist and specialist underwater photographer Roger Grace died at his New Zealand home in June.

So why-yi-yi-yi now?When Sandy told Danny to “Tell me about it stud,” in skin-tight black trousers and a leather jacket in the 1978 film Grease, little did Olivia Newton-John realise her character’s costume would go on to fetch a combined estimate of $230,000 (£185,000) at auction more than 40 years later.These items of cinema history, along with 200 more of the actor’s costumes and personal clothes will go under the hammer at Julien’s Auctions in LA in November, with 32 highlights now on display at the Museum of Style Icons in Ireland.“The trousers and jacket are the most identifiable of pieces and what people remember when they think of Olivia Newton-John,” says Martin Nolan, the executive director of Julien’s Auctions, who is organising the exhibition.The pink lace gown and matching stole that she wore to the LA premiere of Grease is expected to get $8,000. She still remembers the energy emanating from the crowd when she and Travolta stepped out of their car. “I remember thinking: ‘Wow! How do all these people even know about this film?’”The auction is, more than anything, a celebration of Newton-John’s 55-year career. Born in the UK in 1948, she moved to Australia with her family when she was five. By the time she was 15, Newton-John was on TV in a girl band. But her career took off in the 1970s, when she came back to Britain with hits including Take Me Home, Country Roads. In 1974, she was Britain’s entrant to the Eurovision song contest with Long Live Love – and came fourth the winners that year were a then unknown four-piece Swedish pop group called Abba. The album of the same name propelled Newton-John into the US, with I Honestly Love You becoming her first No 1 there and earning her two Grammys. She has since sold an estimated 100m records worldwide, a trajectory that is sartorially documented in the auction.A pair of white and gold lamé shorts and matching top, which she wore to promote her Physical album in 1981, are up for $4,000 and a beaded blue chiffon minidress she wore for her first world tour, Totally Hot, in 1978 is estimated to reach $2,000.Much of the proceeds from the sale will go to the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness \u0026amp Research Centre in Melbourne, established in 2015. Set within the Austin Health hospital campus, the centre offers holistic and traditional treatments, as well as education, training and research, and has more than 200 ongoing clinical trials. Newton-John has been diagnosed with her third bout of breast cancer, which has spread to her lower back, and she is still recovering from last year’s cancer-induced fractured pelvis. The remainder of the funds she may donate elsewhere and a portion she will keep, as, she says: “It’s my career.”Newton-John is keeping certain items “that have personal meaning to me”, she says, citing jewellery and items from her late parents or sister – as well as her four Grammy awards, “because they are the height of my success and the most important one I can receive for singing and the music, so I can give them to my daughter.”The auction is likely to break records, but Newton-John remains self-effacing – and eerily similar to her on-screen character of Sandy. She keeps her multiple awards, from Billboards to People’s Choice, in storage, as “it would be funny to have them all over the house”, and doesn’t watch herself on screen.Yet she remains proud of a career that has seen her rock’n’roll with Travolta, jam with Stevie Wonder in an LA club, skit with Wonder Woman and tap dance with Gene Kelly in the 1980 musical fantasy Xanadu.“It was incredible to dance with Gene Kelly and John Travolta in one lifetime … I did the original Dancing with the Stars!” she laughs. “I feel lucky.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bca7ee599460c3d16977f76168634576197fb53/0_48_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97729313fb6aeecef14c8c9157d0fe99","title":"see you soon film jenia tanaeva","story":"A troubled footballer falls for a Russian single mother in a romantic drama so catastrophically incompetent that it’s destined for cult statusIt’s getting harder and harder to find truly enjoyable bad movies. Cinemas are now almost exclusively full of franchise instalments too expensive to invite any sort of risk. The low-budget stuff has discovered how to paper over flaws with a veneer of cheap self-awareness. Sometimes, most disappointingly of all, when a film has badness baked into its very DNA – like this year’s genuinely ludicrous McConaugheyHathaway noir Serenity – the result is just unacceptably boring when it should have been spectacularly silly.A great bad film – a film where nothing is left on the table, where the script is weird and the budget is squandered and the sex scenes are startlingly graphic and there’s at least one screen legend who looks constantly terrified – just doesn’t come along very often. So when it does, it should be celebrated. Reader, allow me to celebrate See You Soon.See You Soon is a romance about a world famous football player (who is world famous despite playing in America) who crashes his car after getting drunk and becoming distracted by Instagram. Injured, he boards what is either a cruise ship or a moderately sized yacht depending on the shot, and meets a single mother from St Petersburg who has taken a job onboard after escaping her violent husband. They fall in love, but for some reason choose not to exchange any sort of contact details, instead preferring to meet at a set location at a set time at some point in the future. Five minutes before that time comes, the woman’s son falls into a coma after getting pushed to the ground by a bully, and they fail to meet. But then they meet anyway, after the footballer bails on a visit with a Make A Wish kid, and the credits are soundtracked to You’re The Inspiration by Chicago. And Harvey Keitel is in it. Honestly, I don’t understand why you aren’t already watching it.It is such a glorious mess. The footballer, played by Liam McIntyre from Spartacus: Blood and Sand, is the sort of doofus that says his own name out loud whenever he signs an autograph. Jenia Tanaeva, who plays the female lead, has one of those faces where you can’t quite tell if she’s 20 or 60. There are cameos from sporting stars, who all deliver their lines like they’re translating them to English from Esperanto on the fly. The title is terrible. It’s a safe, toothless daytime TV romance, apart from one scene which contains some off-puttingly gratuitous nudity. And then there’s Harvey Keitel, whose performance as a possibly concussed sporting agent makes his Direct Line insurance ads in the UK look like a highlight reel from a Bergman film.Inidually these are all ingredients of a bad film. But there’s an undercurrent that elevates See You Soon, a low-key Wiseau-esque mycelium of How On Earth Did This Get Made? And that’s provided by Jenia Tanaeva, who wrote the script and played the lead despite having no previous acting or writing credits. The woman has almost literally appeared out of nowhere. Her Instagram account seems to have recently been deleted. She has only given a few interviews one to something called Naluda Magazine and another to made-to-measure suits. She is a true enigma.You can pull a rudimentary bio from scraps of information online. Apparently Tanaeva was born in St Petersburg, living in a tiny apartment with her parents, grandparents and sister. She unhappily married a heavyweight wrestling champion, had two children and found work as the assistant to a Russian billionaire. Seeking a better life, she orced her husband and moved to Los Angeles with her two young children, three suitcases and no plans. See You Soon came to fruition after chance meetings with a Warner Bros executive, which led to her getting script notes from Michael Eisner. Somehow, and honestly I have no idea how, she single-handedly willed See You Soon into the world. It shouldn’t exist, but it does, and that’s all down to one woman.See You Soon clearly means everything to Tanaeva. It’s a Cinderella story that she wrote for herself, where she gets to escape her own real-life background. And this is what makes it so special. There isn’t a drop of cynicism to be found anywhere in this film. Even the climactic moment where McIntyre jumps about three inches over a bridge is played for every heart-rending ounce of emotion it can muster. She has poured herself into this project. And, in a way, the fact that it’s not very good just makes it more special.You won’t see a passion project as passionate as See You Soon all year. Don’t get me wrong it is a bad film. But it’s also a little bit brilliant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb96b15c9a578ae82e424e4678a15f4243507df9/0_954_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ac8007b807e4759c7a0c32199b38d9","title":"20 best tomato recipes part 3 kitty travers sorbet jose pizarro sardines","story":"Tomato and white peach sorbet, roast tomatoes and lentils and the ultimate Greek salad – the best ways to enjoy this abundant seasonal ingredientTomatoes are one of the hero ingredients in Greek cooking.

Be careful not to go too far, they burn very easily. Tip them on to a plate to cool a little, then crush them in a mortar to a coarsely ground mixture.Put the sesame seeds into the dry frying pan with the nigella and toast until the sesame seeds are golden. Follow with the sunflower seeds. Roughly crush all the toasted seeds and add to the nuts. Toast the coriander seeds until they smell toasted, then grind them very roughly. Do the same with the peppercorns, then the cumin seeds. Combine the nuts, seeds and toasted spices with the paprika and salt. Store in a jar or other airtight container until you need it.For the tomatoes, preheat the oven to 190Cgas mark 5. Lay the tomatoes in a single layer in a roasting tin. Mix the olive oil and harissa together and pour over. Turn to coat, ending cut side up, then sprinkle with sugar and season. Roast in the oven for 45 minutes, or until caramelised in parts and slightly shrunken.Meanwhile, cook the lentils. Heat the oil in a saucepan and gently sauté the onion, celery and garlic until soft but not coloured. Add the lentils and turn them over in the oil. Chuck in the thyme and bay leaf. Pour on 700ml water, season lightly, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the lentils are just tender. This could take 15-25 minutes depending on their age, so watch them they can turn to mush quickly. When they are cooked, they should have absorbed all the liquid (simply drain them if they haven’t). Remove the thyme and bay leaf. Add the lemon juice. Mix the vinegar and extra virgin oil together and stir it into the lentils with the coriander. Taste for seasoning.Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6 minutes. They should still be a little runny in the middle. Rinse them in cold water and, once cool enough to handle, quickly peel.

Here, I serve it with smoked sardines, as we did at my restaurant Pizarro, but you could add fruit such as melon or grapes to make it even fresher, if you prefer.Serves 6sardines 12 small or 6 large, gutted and bones removedmild-flavoured wood chips or sawdust a handful rosemary 2 sprigs lavender 2 heads fruit vinegar 1 tbsp (raspberry, muscatel or apple are good) sea salt and freshly ground black pepperFor the salmorejoreally ripe tomatoes 800g, cored and roughly choppedstale bread 200g (ciabatta, bread roll, rustic loaf), torngarlic 2 cloves, crushedsherry vinegar 2 tsp extra virgin olive oil 75mlFor the lemon thyme croutonsstale bread 100g, cubedolive oil for fryinglemon thyme 3-4 sprigs To serveeggs 3 free-range extra virgin olive oil for drizzlingFirst, clean the sardines. Wash well, then remove the heads, slit the bellies and take out the insides. Then, with a sharp knife and fingers, pull out the bones. This will leave you with butterflied fillets. Alternatively, you can ask your fishmonger to do this for you. Lay the fish on a board, skin-side up, and allow the skin to dry out a little while you prepare the rest of the dish.To make the salmorejo, put the tomatoes in a blender with the bread, garlic, vinegar and olive oil. Season well and blitz, adding a little cold water to loosen. Season again to taste and chill in the fridge.Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6-7 minutes, then cool under cold water.To make the croutons, fry the bread in olive oil with the lemon thyme until golden and crisp. Sprinkle with sea salt and drain on kitchen paper.Line a wok with foil and scatter with a few wood chips and the herbs. Press a wire rack over the top of the wood chips in the wok, ensuring it fits inside snugly. Place the fish skinside down on the rack, then cover the top with a lid or more foil, to stop the smoke from escaping. Place over a medium heat and, as soon as plumes of smoke have started to appear, smoke for 10-15 minutes, until cooked through. Sprinkle with the fruit vinegar.Peel and slice the eggs. Pour the soup into wide bowls and top with the croutons, egg slices, smoked sardine fillets and a good drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.From Andalusia: Recipes from Seville and beyond by Jose Pizarro (Hardie Grant, £26) When I finally got around to planting my own tomatoes I managed to cram in 70 seedlings between my own 4m allotment plot and the neighbour’s raised bed. Needless to say, the end result was half a mountain of unripened fruit once the growing season was over. Unripe green tomatoes are available at the end of the tomato growing season and are often cheaper than the ripe varieties.This is a family recipe that I’ve adapted to add some depth and get the best out of the tomatoes. I use a mixture of sugars including dark muscovado which gives a richer flavour. To save time (plus I prefer my mix to be fine), I pulse the tomatoes, onions and apples in a processor beforehand.It’s a chutney that goes with everything omelette, curries or with a wedge of cheese and sourdough.Makes approximately 2.5kggreen tomatoes 1.8kg, roughly choppedcooking apples 1.8kg, peeled, cored and roughly chopped onions 450g, peeled and finely chopped garlic 2 cloves, crushed (optional)Place the green tomatoes, apples and onions in a large pan with the garlic (if using), sultanas and salt. Tie together the pickling spice, ginger and chilli in a muslin bag and add to the pan. Add half the malt vinegar and gently bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for an hour or until the fruit is reduced to a pulp and the mixture is thick.Gently dissolve the sugar in the remaining vinegar then add to the chutney. Simmer for a further 1½ hours, stirring often until the mixture is thick.Remove and discard the muslin bag with the spices and while the chutney is still hot, spoon into sterilised jars. Seal with airtight, vinegar-proof covers.Caroline McGivern is the Observer Magazine’s deputy art directorOne of the greatest pleasures I know is to eat along with the characters from books and on TV shows. In one of Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House books there’s a passage I always found incredible: on a hot day Laura’s ma slices up a ripe tomato, and serves it covered with cream and sugar – to be eaten like a peach!I mulled over the idea of a tomato ice-cream for years (tomatoes are actually fruits, so it ought to make sense) before finally getting a chance to test it out using a real old-fashioned hand-cranked machine on a ranch I was teaching at in Colorado. Hand-cranked ice-cream machines are fun and although the tomato ice-cream looked delicious – creamy and candy-pink – no one could swallow the stuff it was too weird. I put the difference in taste down to the fact that Laura Ingalls and family were too far from peaches, and had come close to starving in previous years due to drought and crop failure. And we were very far from starving. Also, I suppose tastes change.Instead, I’ve settled upon this simple and refreshing recipe, unusual rather than flat-out weird, and very lovely. It produces an elegant, shell-pink sorbet with soft sweetness from the tomato and fruitiness from the white peach.Makes approximately 1 litresugar 130g water 130ml white peaches 3, or 4 flat white peachesripe tomatoes 2 (San Marzano are particularly flavoursome)To prepare the sorbet: heat the sugar and water together in a pan to make a simple syrup, stirring to dissolve the grains of sugar. As soon as the syrup starts to simmer remove it from the heat. Set aside to cool and then chill in the fridge until needed.Rinse the tomatoes and peaches, slice them into a bowl, cover with the cool simple syrup and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours, giving it time to really draw the flavour out of the tomato and peach skins.Remove the macerated fruits from the fridge and liquidise them for 2 minutes until very smooth. Pass the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve or chinois, discarding the skin and pips.To make the sorbet: pour the shell-pink purée into an ice cream machine and churn according to the machine’s instructions, usually about 20-25 minutes, till frozen and thick and creamy looking. If you don’t have an ice-cream machine, freeze the mixture in a big bowl. Every 45 minutes, take it out and whisk or beat vigorously. Do this three or four times, until smooth and uniformly frozenTransfer the sorbet to a suitable lidded container. Top with a piece of waxed paper to limit exposure to air, cover and freeze until ready to serve.

Dried chillies and salty, fermented shrimp paste feature in all the recipes I try, and fresh ginger (or galangal), garlic and onion or shallot are also very common. I find, like the dried shrimp that Sylvia Tan, the cook responsible for my first laksa, uses in her book Singapore Heritage Food, the dried chillies benefit from soaking first it makes them easier to blend into the paste. Tan’s is also the only recipe to use candlenuts, so-named for their high oil content, which give her gravy a lovely, nutty richness. They’re hard to get hold of in this country, possibly because they’re mildly toxic when raw, but macadamias make a good substitute.Where the recipes erge, however, is in their use of dried spices. Malaysian chef Norman Musa uses sweeter aromatics such as star anise and cinnamon along with the coriander seeds and turmeric found in Tan’s version, as well as that from Mandy Yin, the Kuala-Lumpur-born chef at my favourite laksa joint, north London’s Sambal Shiok. In fact, Musa uses the most spices of all, also adding cumin, black peppercorns and cardamom to the paste – his laksa is delicious, more savoury and complex to my and my testers’ minds than some of the others, but doesn’t quite hit the classic, comfortingly creamy notes we like so much in Yin’s. For a less rich take, however, I’d highly recommend it.Two potential shortcuts: Mandy Lee of the website Lady and Pups uses ready-mixed curry powder instead of the dry spices, which may save you shopping, if not a great deal of time, while Olive magazine has a quick recipe using ready-made laksa paste, whizzed up with extra garlic, ginger and chilli powder, which does save a considerable amount of the latter. We all find the one I use a bit bland, but this could be adjusted to taste.Frying the paste is an important step if you’re not to end up with a raw-tasting gravy Yin recommends half an hour of patient stirring until it’s really dark, but it dries out under my inexpert care – half that time seems to yield a pretty decent result.Because this is a seafood dish, I don’t think you need to add chicken stock to the broth, unless you want it to be very meaty indeed – in which case, you could do as Lee does and poach a chicken leg in it, then serve the sliced meat on top. It’s simpler, and more appropriate here, to make a prawn stock by adding their shells to plain water, along with some lemongrass for freshness and Yin’s laksa leaves, all of which can be strained out before serving. Laksa leaves are hard to come by unless you have a south-east Asian grocers nearby (ask for hot or Vietnamese mint), so if you can’t find them, do as Yin suggests, and use mint and coriander instead.The strained prawn stock can be diluted with coconut milk to make the gravy (I wouldn’t recommend the light version I try in the Olive recipe: it’s quite thin and bland. If you’re after health food, a fishy assam laksa is probably a better bet, and seasoned according to whim: Yin, Musa and Tan all add sugar as well as salt and pepper, but taste it and see what works for you. You can also add tamarind at this point, if you’d like to make it sourer as well as saltier and sweeter, but I prefer to serve it with fresh lime on the side, not least because it’s easier.One excellent tip from Lee: strain the paste through a fine sieve before diluting it not only is this the easiest way to remove the shells and stalks, but unless you have the most powerful food processor in the world, it gives a much silkier texture to the finished dish.I’m surprised that there is no one standard noodle used for laksa: egg noodles, rice sticks, vermicelli and glass noodles all feature in the recipes I try. All have their fans, but my favourites are the rice sticks and glass noodles, both of which provide a chewier counterpoint to the rich, coconutty broth than soft egg noodles or delicate vermicelli. But use whichever you prefer.Lee says the only two mandatory toppings are prawns, which are “important for flavouring the broth”, and tofu, “to suck it up”. You’ll need to get big prawns for this, unless you do better than me at finding smaller raw ones with their shells still on, and I’d shell them and blanch the meat separately, rather than simmering them whole for half an hour as some recipes do – it makes them very tough and woolly. That said, because I don’t think these big prawns have a great deal of flavour however they’re cooked, I like Lee’s idea of turning them into shrimp meatballs that might sound a faff, but they take only a minute to make, and they’re exponentially more delicious. Tofu-wise, if you can find tofu puffs (and this shouldn’t be hard – they’re fairly standard in south-east Asian supermarkets), they’re the best choice here, because, as Lee says, they soak up the gravy like a delicious sponge.Otherwise, you can add an almost infinite array of things to laksa: blanched vegetables such as beansprouts, runner beans or sugar snap peas supply a pleasing crunch, while testers particularly liked the cool contrast of Olive’s shredded cucumber. Extra protein, such as Tan’s cockles or Lee’s chicken and her spicy pork sauce, is also a possibility a boiled egg, of course, would be the simplest option.Curry laksa is such a rich dish that I like to serve fresh chilli, pounded with a little salt, as in Tan’s recipe, as well as fresh lime wedges and a handful of coriander or laksa leaves. Oh, and a napkin to tuck into your collar. Turmeric is a devil to wash out.8 large raw, shell-on prawns4 tbsp neutral oil1 litre water2 lemongrass stalks, lightly crushed50g laksa leaves (hot mint), or a mix of coriander and mint, plus extra to serve400ml coconut milkSugar, salt and pepper, to taste8 cubes deep-fried tofu (shop-bought is fine)¼ cucumber, deseeded and finely shredded200g wide flat dried rice noodles or vermicelliFor the paste10 dried chillies, soaked30g dried shrimp, soaked75g ginger, peeled6 garlic cloves, peeled4 small Asian shallots (about 50g), peeled30g shrimp paste2 tbsp ground coriander1 tbsp ground turmeric5 macadamia nutsFor the prawn balls (optional)100g pork mince2 tbsp cornflour1 tsp fish sauce¼ tsp white pepperTo serve4 red bird’s eye chillies, chopped1 lime, cut into wedgesSoak the chillies and dried shrimp in hot water for 30 minutes, then drain.

Turn down the heat and leave the broth to simmer gently for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, if you’re making the prawn balls, put the prawn meat in a food processor with all the remaining prawn ball ingredients and whizz to a chunky paste (otherwise, keep the prawns whole and add to the broth for the last minute of cooking). Form the prawn mixture into eight balls wet your hands first, to make it easier to handle.Pass the prawn stock through a fine sieve to remove the solids, squeezing out as much liquid as possible, then return the broth to the pan. Whisk in the coconut milk, return to a boil, then stir in the tofu puffs and prawn balls, and simmer gently for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then ide between four bowls.Pound the fresh bird’s eye chillies with a little coarse salt to make a coarse paste. Check the broth for seasoning, then pour it all over the noodles.

But after his absence from the game against Bayern Munich on Sunday, the French manager brought the winger on from the bench“He put in a good performance and I’m pleased for him,” said Zidane. “Nothing has changed, you know the situation.“He played today, he wanted to and he did a good job. He wanted to be with us today he trained normally and played the match. I make the decisions and he played one half. We’ll have to see what happens. He’s still here with us at this stage.”Bale’s future could be affected by a serious injury suffered during the match by team-mate Marco Asensio. The Spanish winger left the pitch on a stretcher, with Real later confirming in a statement that he had “been diagnosed with a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament and the external meniscus of his left knee. The player will be surgically operated on in the next few days.” Asensio’s injury means he is expected to miss the majority of the upcoming season.Arsenal named a strong side captained by Mesut Ozil while Real had Bale on the bench and Eden Hazard, wearing the number 50 shirt, starting alongside fellow new signing Luka Jovic in attack.The match, however, looked to be over as a contest after Real defender Nacho was sent off for two yellow cards in a frantic early spell in the United States capital.The Spain international was shown one yellow card for a foul on Sead Kolasinac and another after blocking Alexandre Lacazette’s shot with his hand on the goal line.Lacazette stepped up to sneak the 10th minute penalty home, before the Frenchman delightfully flicked the ball through for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to double the lead 14 minutes later.The referee evened things up, however, when he again brandished two yellow cards in quick succession to send Arsenal’s Sokratis Papastathopoulos from the field in the 40th minute.Bale and Asensio scored inside three second-half minutes to level up the scores and take the game to penalties.Arsenal edged in front in the shootout when Reiss Nelson scored his spot kick and Bale missed his, but misses from Granit Xhaka, Nacho Monreal and Robbie Burton proved costly and Real ran out 3-2 winners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd16dd677a60f07bb445aa50bb5e8a726098369/0_316_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dddf1baab14ad36356cc40d032dd7c4d","title":"guardian world music outdated global","story":"Artists, record labels and even this month’s Womad festival agree that the term is outdated. Is there a better way to market music from across the globe?Ask most musicians what genre they play and you’ll likely get a prickly response. As one well-known, and slightly tipsy, jazz musician once told me: “If you all stopped obsessing about me playing ‘jazz’, maybe I would be playing festival stages rather than tiny clubs by now.” But while there have been meandering debates about jazz during its long history, another genre has become far more contentious in recent years: world music.Dreamed up in a London pub in 1987 by DJs, record producers and music writers, it was conceived as a marketing term for the greater visibility of newly popularised African bands, following the success of Paul Simon’s Johannesburg-recorded Graceland the year before. “It was all geared to record shops. That was the only thing we were thinking about,” DJ Charlie Gillett, one of the pub-goers, told the  in 2004. The group raised £3,500 from 11 independent labels to begin marketing “world music”to record stores. “It was the most cost-effective thing you could imagine,” said record producer Joe Boyd. “£3,500 and you get a whole genre – and a whole section of record stores today.”Founders of the term provided vague justifications for lumping together anything that wasn’t deemed to be from a European or American tradition – “looking at what artists do rather than what they sound like”, as editor of fRoots magazine Ian Anderson said. The World of Music, Arts and Dance Festival, AKA Womad, which was founded seven years before the term gained prominence, similarly used it as a catch-all for its roster of international artists. “There were no other festivals like ours at the time,” artistic programmer Paula Henderson says. “We weren’t pop or rock, so we were happy to advertise it as world when we began.”But the term soon faced opposition. Talking Heads frontman David Byrne founded the label Luaka Bop, which has released artists who might be placed in the “world” category, including William Onyeabor and Susana Baca. In 1999, he wrote a scathing op-ed in the New York Times called I Hate World Music in which he argued that listening to music from other cultures, “letting it in”, allows for it to change our world view and to reduce what was once exotic into part of ourselves. World music meant the opposite: a distancing between “us” and “them”: “It’s a none too subtle way of reasserting the hegemony of western pop culture,” Byrne wrote. “It ghettoises most of the world’s music. A bold and audacious move, White Man!”So why has the term persisted? Strut Records manager Quinton Scott, who releases a range of artists, including soul singer Patrice Rushen, spiritual-jazz icon Sun Ra and Seun Kuti, son of Afrobeat pioneer Fela, says: “As labels we need to guide buyers to the right place to find the music as quickly as possible, especially in the chaotic digital marketplace. For that reason, a general term or genre still does work as an in-point for music buyers.”Yet as a general term, he admits, “it does feel dated”. “Musicians have successfully cross-pollinated styles much more in recent years, to complicate matters further, so it could be changed to something that sounds more contemporary. But I don’t think there can ever be a catch-all phrase that avoids overgeneralisation.” As Womad’s Henderson puts it: “If the consumer wants to class it as world music, as long as they buy the ticket or the music, that’s fine by me.”Other industry heads are less equivocal. “It’s the antithesis of art,” says Pete Buckenham, founder of the independent label On the Corner. “At its best, it’s bad culture, dialled-down and made safe for a generic, mostly western consumer as imagined by a marketing department. At worst, the term is out-and-out racist.” For Buckenham, “world” must be abolished and the industry should lead the way. “When the term is so flawed and ideologically problematic there is no alternative.”The musicians who have found themselves in the world record bins largely agree. Indian jazz drummer and producer Sarathy Korwar finds the term lazy. “It only helps reinforce the narrative that other people’s music is less evolved and important than your own and doesn’t deserve a more nuanced approach,” he says. Multimillion selling Senegalese musician Youssou N’Dour believes the label has “served its purpose” and can only now be applied to collaborations that  across the globe, geographically taking in the world through their mixture of cultural traditions.For Réunion Island musician Jérémy Labelle, the initial labelling of his amorphous electronic music as world was enticing, allowing him to broaden his appeal to a network of world music festivals and events. “But I quickly understood that this label was very dangerous, especially for music like mine that seeks to create bridges between aesthetics,” he says. Congolese funk band Bantou Mentale, encountered similar issues. Their solution? Abolish all generic descriptors, since “categorisation equals discrimination”.It is a question of ethnicity as much as one of perceived authenticity and category. London-based trio Vula Viel centre their work around the west African xylophone, the gyil, which bandleader Bex Burch learned when she spent three years with the Dagaaba people in Ghana. Burch hails from Yorkshire and the other members of Vula Viel are white. “I’ve had world music industry people say my band does not fit the world genre because I’m not African,” she says, raising the issue of cultural appropriation. “The sad fact is that musicians from African countries are still refused visas and have much less access to the music industry. So, the white ‘saviour’ tries to bring the black or brown musicians from a village to a studio or festival stage and profits from them. The fact I’m told I need a black member of my band to qualify is another example of tokenism and the blatant exoticising of black skin.”In 2018, Womad experienced visa denials for its acts, with at least three having to cancel appearances, yet Henderson disagrees with the ‘white saviour’ term. “Visas are so expensive and the Home Office can be so prohibitive when it comes to bringing artists from other countries here,” she says. “Often, it’s only with the help of western festival organisers that we can mitigate the denials – otherwise an act will pay £6,000 for a visa, be denied, and never see that money or a potential new audience again. We always make sure our artists are paid fairly and aren’t exploited.”My first experience of “world music” went unnoticed. It was the Bollywood songs that played through our kitchen radio and that my grandma listened to religiously. It was the devotional music I heard at temple, and perhaps even the reggae records my mum put on. To me, this was simply music – to be included with the other formative records and artists of my childhood: Motown, hip-hop, jazz.When the  began its world music coverage, it was a reflection of a music industry coming to terms with a new, globalised landscape – one not only confined to the recesses of the record store. Now, with the internet at our fingertips and streaming services providing endless hours of musical discovery, the world has reached far beyond the meaning of “world music”.  has therefore ceased using this tag on its articles: only a relevant genre tag such as pop and rock, dance music and metal will be used. Rest assured that we are more committed than ever to telling the stories of music around the world, be it disco as from India, techno from Uganda, reinventions of classical Korean instrumentation, or political Turkish psych-rock.Our world album of the month column has, meanwhile, been renamed global album of the month, which does not answer the valid complaints of the artists and record label founders who have been plagued by catch-all terms. Yet, in the glorious tyranny of endless internet-fuelled musical choice, marginalised music still needs championing and signposting in the west. The term “world music” has become toxic, so a new word for this monthly planet-ning roundup, however reductive, is needed. As Vula Viel’s Birch says: “Is ‘world’ helpful? Musically, no, but as a genre to champion and curate this fantastic world of music, sure.”For its latest edition, Womad is also moving on from the term, simply calling itself “the world’s festival”. “We understand ‘world music’ is ghettoising for a lot of the artists,” festival director Chris Smith says. “We’re respectful of the term because it’s our heritage, but we need to evolve it because the music has evolved. All that matters is championing new music for people to hear and enjoy. We don’t want these artists to be held back by genre, we want to see them at Glastonbury and beyond. We’re international, world, whatever you want to call it – it’s just music.”• Womad festival is at Charlton Park, Wiltshire, 25-28 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e79939d346e95303f7366ffac67bb232d4255a/575_637_5853_3512/master/5853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=567a4b33c5e284c55089d5b731dc6596","title":"review il segreto di susanna iolanta review opera holland park london","story":"Opera Holland Park, LondonA double bill of Tchaikovsky and Wolf-Ferrari operas make an odd couple, but they work together beautifully, with glorious central performancesThis double bill is an odd couple: first, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari’s frothy 1909 comedy about a wife who’s so keen to hide her nicotine habit that she inadvertently lets her husband think she’s taken a lover then, Tchaikovsky’s lushly romantic one-acter about true love restoring a blind princess’s sight.Opera Holland Park’s new productions make no attempt to draw any links, and the evening works just fine that way. The only shared element is the designer, takis, and his work for the one is the polar opposite of the other.In Il Segreto di Susanna, it’s the lingering smell of smoke in Count Gil’s flat that makes him suspicious, and even if we can’t smell the stage cigarettes, we can imagine the heady atmosphere in the flower-filled, panelled living room as Gil, in his rose-pink three-piece suit, throws himself down on the chaise longue.Dramatically, the piece sits somewhere between comedy and farce, with a few lines worthy of a 1980s sitcom – “My mother? She’s probably at it too” – and a sly charm that comes over nicely in John Wilkie’s production. Musically, it’s sweet, glittery and, yes, perfumed, with solo flute and muted violin wafting languorous rings into the air whenever Susanna takes a drag.Conducted by John Andrews, the City of London Sinfonia as yet lacks a bit of confidence in the strings, but the piece comes to life thanks to stage-filling performances by Richard Burkhard as blustery Gil, Clare Presland as wily Susanna and John Savournin as their Basil Fawlty-esque servant.Olivia Fuchs’s production of Iolanta takes place a world away, in a starkly grey set where fluorescent tubes delineate the princess’s sterile room and the strings of lights trace the outlines of tree trunks it’s relentlessly drab until Mark Jonathan’s lighting warms and flickers as Iolanta’s sight returns. Maybe Tchaikovsky is a more skilful orchestrator than Wolf-Ferrari, but, with Sian Edwards conducting, the singers have no trouble getting across the orchestra. Mikhail Svetlov provides genuine Russian vocal heft as the King, and the two glorious central performances, from soprano Natalya Romaniw in the title role and tenor David Butt Philip as smitten Vaudémont, are enough on their own to make the whole evening worthwhile."},{"url":null,"title":"teen rapper tay k sentenced to 55 years the race","story":"Taymor McIntyre sentenced along with six other men for death of Ethan Walker, after recording platinum hit The Race as a fugitiveUS rapper Tay-K has been sentenced to 55 years in prison for murder, with a platinum-certified hit song he released as a fugitive being included in prosecution evidence.Taymor McIntyre, 19, was found guilty along with six other men of the killing of Ethan Walker, in Mansfield, Texas, in July 2016. The men had intended to rob Walker and another man of drugs and money and in the subsequent home invasion, Walker was shot dead. His girlfriend testified that he’d had his hands in the air when he was killed.McIntyre’s lawyers had argued he didn’t fire the lethal shot, and the rapper testified that his job in the robbery had been to find drugs to steal, but he was found guilty of murder as well as three counts of aggravated robbery.McIntyre’s rap career grew as the infamy of his case brought him to national attention. After being charged with murder, aged 16, McIntyre was placed under house arrest, but in March 2017 he removed his ankle tag and fled, writing on Twitter: “fuck dis house arrest shit … they gn hav 2 catch me”. He made his way north from Texas to New Jersey, where he recorded The Race, a track that boasted of his fugitive status: “Ain’t beat that case, bitch I did the race.”The track reached No 44 in the US charts, and was remixed by prominent rappers including 21 Savage, Tyga and Lil Yachty. The video has been viewed more than 174m times on YouTube, and the song was certified platinum in January 2018. Prosecutors played the video during the trial, which features McIntyre filmed in front of his own wanted poster, and showed the song’s lyrics to the court.McIntyre was recaptured in June 2017, and is accused of two further serious crimes committed while on the run: the murder of 23-year-old Mark Salar following an altercation in San Antonio, Texas, and the robbery and beating of 65-year-old Owney Pepe in Arlington, Texas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f345508d0a6826ed2fd0a61d2351bd873912fed/0_0_6347_3808/master/6347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c88efa4a21e3e33dc066ee3383ff0c49","title":"stranded in pakistan why did the home office deny a baby a visa","story":"Nina Saleh, a British resident for 20 years, travelled to Pakistan to adopt a baby and was then repeatedly denied a visa, leaving her trapped abroad for months on end.

Is it a no-deal Brexit? The no-deal Brexit will never be never the choice of the EU but we are prepared and for an orderly Brexit. We will work all along the next few weeks or months with the new UK government in the best possible way in the very constructive spirit to facilitate the ratification of the withdrawal agreement.”The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. A complete clearout of May’s remain-minded ministers is expected.The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May’s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy, something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwasn’t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn’t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn’t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out.Such has been the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters – especially Tory members – will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider – during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May’s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care the future of the NHS a climate emergency the increasingly insecure future of work a broken housing market rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.Critics might say this is Johnson’s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor – an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers – Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 – a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness. Curbing these long habits will be a daily struggle.Asked whether he knew what Johnson would seek from Brussels, Barnier said: “No, we are ready to listen and to work with him in a constructive way. We will wait for the new decision, the new declarations of the UK government.Johnson has said he wants to scrap the Irish backstop from the withdrawal agreement and hold back on paying the UK’s multi-billion pound financial settlement until a free trade deal is agreed. He has warned that the UK must leave the EU by 31 October with or without a deal.Earlier in the day, the European parliament’s Brexit steering group held an “extraordinary meeting” to discuss the developments in London.A statement from the MEPs, led by the former Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, warned that recent comments “not least those made during the Conservative party leadership campaign, have greatly increased the risk of a disorderly exit of the UK”.Verhofstadt told reporters that the EU would not countenance a fresh negotiation on arrangements to replicate key aspects of the withdrawal agreement and cushion the impact of a no-deal Brexit. The EU insists that a stand-still transition period will only be granted if the withdrawal agreement, including the contentious backstop, is ratified by parliament.Verhofstadt said: “Politicised language from the Conservative leadership raising the spectre of a no-deal Brexit is unhelpful, irresponsible and only increases the risks of a catastrophic severance, which could destabilise the global economy.“We are united in the view that a no-deal exit will not be mitigated by any form of arrangements or mini-deals between the EU and the UK.“Boris Johnson will find the European parliament an open and constructive partner. I look forward to alleviating Mr Johnson’s concerns regarding the imminent accession of Turkey to the EU, following the claims of the leave campaign, whilst explaining the EU has no rules on the packaging of kippers in the UK.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b9c8540ad1de11eba530d668982099b78166d01/496_1374_3283_1970/master/3283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4300637996c561415575f27dca23ce8","title":"john marsden on the toxic parenting pandemic ive never seen this level of anxiety","story":"The Australian author and principal says it is becoming more difficult to run a school, with overprotective parents failing their childrenJohn Marsden has spent decades writing about, teaching and founding schools for young people – and lately, he has been getting worried. Really worried.In his new book about how we treat and understand children, Marsden – the author best known for his Tomorrow, When The World Began series – is in no mood for niceties about contemporary parenting. “We are seeing an epidemic of damaging parenting at the moment,” he writes.In The Art of Growing Up, billed as a manifesto, Marsden writes of the problematic state of parents being in love with their children, rather than loving them. He warns of parents playing eternal advocate for children who may not be as gifted or guileless as adults may like to imagine. He despairs at “curling parents” – the Scandinavian term for those who furiously clear all paths for their children. “Toxic parenting,” he writes, is having serious impacts.But are we engaged in “toxic parenting” en masse? Or is it just a case of extremes worsening?“No, I think this is a widespread problem,” Marsden says. “Damaging parenting,” he says, is not equivalent to emotional abuse, but rather represents an “ill-conceived and misguided” approach that is doing significant emotional damage.“It’s mostly the middle class that I’m referring to. It’s not that people are setting out to act destructively, but their common sense and instincts seem to have been overridden by other considerations. The emotional damage is coming from an anxiety which often approaches panic.”In the last five years, he says, it has become more difficult to run a school (he is principal and founder of two). And The Art of Growing Up does, at times, read much like the work of a principal who is fed up.Marsden says that this contemporary crop of teenagers is outperforming generations past in terms of academic achievement, political engagement and so on – but he is fearful about their emotional health, borne out by statistics on the prevalence of mental health issues among the young.“The scale of the problem is massive. The issue of emotional damage is pandemic,” he tells the . “The level of anxiety is something I’ve never seen before, and I don’t know how it can be improved.”Marsden says that much of the anxiety among parents and children springs from concern that the world is a dangerous place, with traditional “safe” authority figures no longer to be trusted. That, coupled with an infantilisation of children as pure, helpless creatures, leads parents to cosset and fret over their offspring, and demand much of the same from educational institutions.“Part of that is a fear, in particular, of physical injury,” he says. “Of course, all reasonable parents are concerned about physical injury to a child, but if that overrides everything else then what you have instead is a kind of slow death by emotional damage which is so awful to witness.”Marsden runs two private schools in Victoria, both housed on extensive bushland campuses. Children climb trees, ride bikes, camp and don’t wear uniforms. They are expensive schools to attend but Marsden believes all schools can address the “boring”, “antiseptic” lives of contemporary children and young people, lives which are lived primarily through second-hand experiences, he says, and devoid of grazed knees.“It’s ironic that in Australia, which has more free space than about anywhere in the world, children are put into school campuses which have recreation areas the size of a few basketball courts. And the rules are: you’re not allowed to run, you’re not allowed to touch other people, you’re not allowed to share food … you certainly can’t pick up a stick, you certainly can’t climb a tree.” He is incredulous.By limiting children’s exposure to danger, to fear, we are limiting their ability to mature, develop resilience and independence, he says. Marsden despairs at parents who don’t allow four-year-olds to peel their own mandarins. “They’re capable of helping themselves and we have to be forceful in making sure we step back.”And from the grace of childhood, so venerated by society, children inevitably fall when they become adolescents, demonised by finger-wagging elders. The feelings and experiences of these young people are too often trivialised, he says, while we constantly worry over exposure to sugar, screens and cyberbullies.Marsden doesn’t like to think in terms of optimism or pessimism. It’s a bit of a cop-out, relinquishing the optimist of the obligation to make the world better. And while he has no hesitation in labelling various parts of today’s parenting and childhood culture at crisis levels – attitudes and behaviours which can be linked to tragedies ranging from addiction to domestic violence – he won’t be drawn on whether what is happening today is more toxic than what has happened in the past.“We’re failing them in different ways,” he says. And, for Marsden, that’s not just good enough.• The Art of Growing Up by John Marsden is out 23 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc5ba56694c68a86cc4eae5a35fe2ae321861125/810_393_5279_3168/master/5279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9668357b38e87a362ff7be166ee0a8d","title":"100m bacteria a day keep the doctor away apple research suggests","story":"Study finds organic apples have more erse and balanced bacterial communityThe impact of an apple a day in keeping the doctor away may be partly down to the beneficial bacteria it carries and their subsequent colonisation of your gut, according to scientists.A study has found that a typical apple carries more than 100m bacteria. Some of these microbes are important in maintaining a healthy gut environment, or microbiome, says Prof Gabriele Berg from Graz University of Technology, Austria, one of the authors of the research.“The bacteria, fungi and viruses in our food transiently colonise our gut,” she said. “Cooking kills most of these, so raw fruit and veg are particularly important sources of gut microbes.”The researchers compared the bacteria in shop-bought apples with those in visually matched organic ones. The apple’s stem, peel, flesh, seeds and calyx – the straggly bit at the bottom where the flower used to be – were all analysed separately.Although organic and conventional apples were occupied by similar numbers of bacteria, the researchers found organic apples harboured a more erse and balanced bacterial community, which they said could make them healthier and tastier than conventional apples.Variety in the microbiome is thought to be key to a healthy gut and the researchers said there appeared to be more microbial ersity in organic apples.“Freshly harvested, organically managed apples harbour a significantly more erse, more even and distinct bacterial community, compared to conventional ones,” explained Berg. “This variety and balance would be expected to limit overgrowth of any one species, and previous studies have reported a negative correlation between human pathogen abundance and microbiome ersity of fresh produce.” In other words, the more varied your diet, the fewer harmful bacteria are found.The research may also vindicate the people who claim to be able to taste the difference between organic and ordinary produce, say the researchers. A microbe known as methylobacterium, which is known to boost strawberry-flavoured compounds, was significantly more abundant in organic apples, Berg said.Birgit Wassermann, also at Graz University of Technology and the lead author of the study, said the next step would be “to confirm to what extent ersity in the food microbiome translates to gut microbial ersity and improved health outcomes”.She also suggested that this information might one day appear on supermarket food labels. “The microbiome and antioxidant profiles of fresh produce may one day become standard nutritional information, displayed alongside macronutrients, vitamins and minerals to guide consumers,” she added.The research was published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b851be3b52ba91ab7031a7f2b77ceb7d3467f381/0_157_4723_2834/master/4723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3972863a1becc7e66fc964df2c1bdffc","title":"specialist doctor learning disability save lives","story":"The first doctor specialising in profound and multiple learning disabilities in the UK is set to be recruited later this year. Hull clinical commissioning group (CCG) took the decision to employ a specialist PMLD doctor to support adults with complex needs after the condition of a patient, Erica Carlin, improved dramatically following the care she had received for serious digestive and bowel problems from a palliative care doctor trained in learning disabilities.Three years ago, doctors had told Carlin’s family to prepare for her death. They said they could no longer treat the then 34-year-old, who has epilepsy and profound multiple learning disabilities. Today her health is stable. She lives in residential care in Hull near her family and enjoys trips to the local park.Her health was transformed, say her family and campaigners, because the palliative care doctor she was referred to had happened to train in a medical specialism called “intellectual disability” in Holland. There, medics are uniquely taught to put patients with learning disabilities at the centre of their care. As a result, the doctor was able to coordinate the professionals involved in Carlin’s care, including neurologists, bowel consultants, the GP and learning disability nurses, to ensure they provided holistic support.Carlin’s mother, Jeanne, says: “I don’t think Erica would still be with us if someone hadn’t looked at all of those parts that make up a person. With one doctor liaising with everyone, we didn’t have to keep trying to get hold of consultants. The doctor suggested something and we’d start the prescription immediately rather than waiting for appointments.”Carlin’s story proves the need for a network of specialist physicians, according to a group of experts made up of parents of people with learning disabilities, learning disabled people themselves, (involved through support charities Respond and Stay Up Late) a psychiatrist, nurses, and health agencies such as NHS England and Public Health England.The group’s work is timely because of a growing focus on the entrenched health inequalities faced by learning disabled people. Autism and learning disability are priorities in the NHS long-term plan, and a recent NHS-commissioned review of mortality rates shows learning disabled people die earlier and are more likely to die in hospital than the general population. Recent inquests into the deaths of people including Richard Handley, Joe Ulleri and Oliver McGowan reflect the inequality.In Hull, the CCG is collaborating with families on the job description to recruit the PMLD specialist, which is a two year pilot. “They’ve told us that people who have learning disabilities and multiple health needs struggle to navigate the care system and we recognise that this may mean patients haven’t always received the care they needed in the most coordinated way,” says Melanie Bradbury, the CCG’s strategic lead for mental health and learning disabilities commissioning.Victoria Smith, who has a learning disability and works at the charity Stay Up Late, welcomes the idea of specialist doctors as she worries about misdiagnoses “because someone might have a communication problem”. “I pulled a ligament in my ankle, they gave me some leaflets and sent me home. They didn’t explain it to me … it would be good if you had the same person to speak with so you can build a relationship,” she says.Oliver McGowan, 18, who had epilepsy, cerebral palsy and autism, died at Southmead hospital in Bristol in 2016 after being given antipsychotic medication. He and his parents had warned doctors that the drug might harm him. Oliver’s mother, Paula, has campaigned for the government to introduce mandatory learning disability and autism training for health and social care staff. She supports the idea of having specialist doctors for people with learning disabilities: “It could mean that when someone presents with challenging behaviour this isn’t necessarily seen as a psychiatric disorder but could be the result of a medical condition,” says McCowan.But she warns that the specialist will only make a difference if they call the shots. They “need to be suitably empowered in all clinical settings and available 247 – they’ve got to have the casting vote”.Critics, including learning disability nurses, question the need for a new specialty and suggest nursing needs better funding and recognition. Daniel Marsden, senior lecturer in learning disability nursing at Kingston University, warns that there could be recruitment problems for specialist doctors, given the extra training required. However, he admits the current system “struggles to coordinate care across specialisms” and that specialist doctors could work well alongside nurses: “I don’t think there’s necessarily duplication, although the roles do intersect.”Responding to concerns, the former health minister, Norman Lamb, a Liberal Democrat MP, who convened the expert group, stresses that specialists would “complement and support” learning disability nurses and “challenge a culture that too often treats people with learning disability as second-class citizens”. Lamb adds: “A new specialty would lead to a much needed focus on the complex interaction between physical health conditions and learning disability, which too often are misunderstood or neglected.”Lamb’s sister, retired GP Kirsten Lamb, is coordinating research for the expert group on a specialist doctor role. She believes it is “a possible solution to part of the inequality problem facing people with learning disabilities”. She explains that a specialist would lead the care of someone with complex needs in a multi-disciplinary team similar to those in geriatric care or community paediatrics. “We should have the same approach in learning disability,” she says.As for practical challenges, Kirsten Lamb believes it is not yet clear if the role would require new courses in medical schools. She says the expert group will need to closely watch how the Hull model progresses and evaluate its impact.NHS England says it will look at the research when it is published. “NHS England will consider this proposal as part of a larger body of work to support the care and treatment of people with a learning disability,” says an NHS spokesman.Back in Hull, Jeanne Carlin remains resolute: “In terms of stopping the premature deaths of people with profound and multiple learning disabilities, this specialist is the answer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdcf0d0c3cc0dc1a332e394096de7d49b891971e/0_509_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ad891724f84ecdff26d069f96644c66","title":"windrush nursing top jobs programme bme nurses","story":"NHS staff from BME backgrounds are more likely to face discrimination and bullying, and less likely to land senior rolesSix months ago Aisha Okafor (not her real name), in her 30s, was ready to quit her job as a nurse and leave the NHS.The reason? Okafor, an employee of South London and Maudsley NHS trust (Slam), says she was tired of being ignored, criticised and treated with contempt by colleagues because of the colour of her skin.There have been many obstacles in her career so far, she says. But there is one that stands out. On her first day of a secondment, she believes the ward manager blanked her and later dismissed her in front of everybody when she tried to introduce herself in a meeting. Okafor said the ward manager avoided her and would sit with two white colleagues at lunch, with no physical space for her to join them. There was one other black nurse and Okafor suspects the pair were kept separate, working different shifts.She remembers: “The ward manager said she found me intimidating and told me I needed to think about how I approach things – there were no examples. It was more about that person and how they weren’t comfortable with ersity. That experience really upset me.”What’s more, BME staff are more likely to experience discrimination and bullying in the workplace than their white colleagues, and are disproportionately involved in disciplinary proceedings.Catherine Gamble, head of nursing education, practice and research at South West London and St George’s NHS trust (SWLSTG), had seen this play out in her career and decided to do something about it. She says: “I’m not from a BME background but I felt deeply uncomfortable that our service users were perhaps not getting the service they should expect. My hypothesis is if you have more ersity in senior management roles, you’re more likely to have inclusive patient care and an understanding of the issues of the community we serve.”Although the trust saw leadership and professional development as a priority, having a separate programme for BME staff was not. Gamble put in a bid to the Burdett trust for nursing and won a grant of £176,000: the money allowed her to set up a steering group involving the local university, which would provide teaching and supervision, patients, carers, and senior representatives from the Royal College of Nursing and others. The programme was spearheaded by people from minority ethnic backgrounds and there were focus groups with staff to find out what they needed.The resulting Burdett BME nurse development programme, which offers six full-day sessions over six months, is now on its second round. On the first day participants have an hour to express their frustrations and explain why they are there, before they are told their experiences are the norm and that people in high positions have been through the same.The programme features games based on exploring management theory, and exercises where participants are encouraged to think about themselves and what they bring to their job. They also receive one-to-one coaching and must come up with a project they can implement in their jobs.All this had an impact on the first cohort. Within six months, half of the attendees showed a desire to progress in their careers by applying for new roles. All 18 people who submitted applications were shortlisted, and 14 of them were successful. One of them was Simon Arday, 30, who is approaching the end of his Darzi fellowship, which he would never have applied for had it not been for the programme. “For me one of the biggest parts has been about finding my voice. I know how much this programme enabled me to do that,” he says.The first programme made such a positive impact that SWLSTG decided to team up with Slam to fund a second round. The scheme is part of a wider programme at Slam to help BME staff and explore why there aren’t many in senior positions. Beverley Murphy, director of nursing, explains: “It’s really impactful to hear our BME staff talk about the weathering impact of working in public organisations including our own and how they feel overlooked and that they don’t have the same opportunities … It’s shameful, absolutely shameful.”Its future is far from certain, but for now it’s still having a huge impact. Okafor, who was initially sceptical about the programme but has now decided to stay in the NHS, says : “This course has helped me … I’m confident now.” She’s set herself the goal of applying for a more senior role within six months, and her ultimate dream is to have a job that would allow her to work in improving ersity. “I think it’s time we call things what they are,” she adds. “If we think there’s institutionalised racism, let’s call it what it is.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98ba4fca9e42acabd3a7b113bfc27f4f2e0b6d4c/0_82_2463_1477/master/2463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=074f7984af6554bc103c5c06c6dd7b40","title":"filming digital distraction live sport iphones","story":"Asked recently at a press conference why he thought attendances at National Collegiate Athletic Association football games were in decline, the Northwestern University coach Pat Fitzgerald posited an intriguing, if slightly odd theory. Picking up his mobile and waving it in the air before reporters, he proceeded to lay the blame squarely at the door of technology. “I think phones,” he said. “I think technology has been the decline in attendance, No 1.”Fitzgerald went on to tell the story of being out with his wife for a meal and being irritated by the sight of all four members of the two couples at the next table spending their entire evening staring at and playing with their smartphones instead of talking to each other and suggested that younger sports fans are incapable of enjoying anything without the aid of technology.“You watch a concert and everybody’s holding their phone up,” he said in exasperation. “Like, listen! Watch! Take it in! Create a memory! Because they don’t go back and watch the videos. They just want to post it on their social media. Which is pathetic because it creates a society of ‘Look at me! Isn’t my life great?’.”Old man yells at cloud, Abraham Simpson style? Perhaps, although Fitzgerald’s response to the query posed came across as more reasoned rationale than curmudgeonly rant. He did, however, overlook the fairly obvious and contradictory point that to be in a position to film footage at a concert or ball game for one’s Instagram account, a fan actually has to be there in the first place, a state of affairs that ought to lead to more bums on seats, not fewer.He did, however, go on to say that youngsters these days would “rather have 12 TVs set up in their TV-watching cave than go to a game and experience the pageantry and tailgating”. Posted online, the clip of Fitzgerald’s broadside against modern technology has since been seen more than two million times and counting, presumably by a majority of people going some way towards proving his point by watching and listening to it on their phones.Reaction to the two-minute clip has been predictably mixed. Rick Tarsitano, a sports producer with Chicago-based TV station WGN-TV, who posted it on Twitter said he “couldn’t agree more”, a view that was endorsed by the college sports podcaster Aaron Torres, who was instrumental in it going viral.Sports Illustrated, in stark contrast, portrayed Fitzgerald, who is 44, as some sort of Luddite, making the not unreasonable point that “the home-viewing experience is a far superior experience than attending a game when it comes to football and it has nothing to do with iPhones.” Writing for the magazine’s website, Jimmy Traina cited cold weather and the prohibitive expense of attending NCAA games where punters are often forced to endure the braying of boorish, misbehaving drunks as the real reasons why attendances are falling. His was a view shared by many on Twitter.Whatever your thoughts on the merits of Fitzgerald’s grumble, he is undeniably astute in his assessment that the smartphone has revolutionised the viewing habits of sports fans. Attendances at top-flight football grounds have rarely been healthier but the huge number of fans who seem to view the stadium as little more than a film set full of unpaid extras on which they can record social media productions in which they play the starring role is increasingly apparent.Not content with going to the ground to see the football match, they must also be seen seeing the football match. Remember that Liverpool supporter holding up his phone to record his role in the stirring rendition of You’ll Never Walk Alone during their Champions League semi-final comeback against Barcelona? While his was an utterly harmless wheeze, the vitriol with which the sight of his impromptu movie-making was greeted by fellow football fans on social media was telling. Like coach Fitzgerald, they felt he should have been listening, watching, taking it in and creating a memory.Of course, the scouse Spielberg could legitimately argue that such “bah humbuggery” is ridiculously over the top as it’s not every day you get to capture your part in such a special and rare occasion on film, but even the crushingly mundane has become apparently essential viewing. Pitchside, the sight of fans living their sporting life through a lens has become so commonplace that scarcely a throw-in or corner can now be taken without dozens of amateur filmmakers in the immediate vicinity recording them on laptops or smartphones for posterity.Away from the stadiums, technology has also revolutionised the way fans watch football, not least because the evolution of Twitter means that any incident of note in any game is almost immediately accessible for public viewing. Few, beyond the most devoted would have sat down in front of the television for the entirety of Liverpool’s pre-season friendly against Sevilla at Fenway Park last Sunday, but we’ve all seen the comically wild tackle on Yasser Larouci that earned Joris Gnagnon a red card.With attention s understandably shortening as the various forms of football distraction – clipped highlights, pre- and post-match analysis and reaction, impromptu tours of Jesse Lingard’s Miami hotel suite – vying for our focus continues to mushroom, a generation has reached a point where it is easy for them to stay completely apprised of what is going on in the world of football without having to do anything so time-consuming as watch an actual game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00098168520c41591baa03f16fc43f93b3d50554/0_261_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=466a44bb344a2c48d3c38dc0fb7d0d55","title":"gold medal winning wrestler artur taymazov 60th athlete disqualified from london 2012","story":"Uzbek freestyle wrestler Artur Taymazov has been stripped of his London 2012 Olympic gold medal after re-analysis of stored samples, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Tuesday. Taymazov, whose 2008 gold was taken away in 2017 after a re-testing of samples from the Beijing Games, is the 60th athlete to be disqualified from the London Olympics after the event. Only nine athletes were caught by anti-doping tests during those Games. The IOC said Taymazov, who won men’s freestyle 120kg gold at three successive Games, had been disqualified from the results after a positive test for the prohibited substance Dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (oral turinabol). The Russian-born Uzbek was ordered to return the London medal. He also won gold at Athens in 2004 and a 130kg silver in Sydney in 2000. His London gold had made him the most successful freestyle competitor in Olympic history.The 120kg silver medallist from London 2012, Georgian Davit Modzmanashvili, was stripped of that medal in January this year after a re-analysis also tested positive for oral turinabol.

If he’s proven not guilty, well that’s fine, he can go back to swimming.“I mean we go back to East Germany when all those German swimmers were caught with drugs. We want a clean sport and let’s protest against it. Fina got to get off their backsides and do something about it.”Sun served a three-month ban for a doping offence in 2014 that was kept under wraps by FINA and the Chinese Swimming Association and emerged only after it had expired.Sun blamed the failed drug test that led to that ban on medication he said he was taking for a heart condition and did not know was prohibited. Last year he was also alleged to have smashed a container holding one of his blood samples with a hammer.He was cleared by a Fina Doping Panel in January over the test but the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) has filed an appeal to Cas.Olympic champion Horton, runner-up in the 400m at Gwangju, labelled Sun a “drug cheat” at the 2016 Rio Games, triggering a fierce response in China.His podium protest on Sunday was pilloried by Chinese state media and prompted a warning from Fina.Fraser defended Horton for making his stand. “Mack didn’t say anything. He hasn’t made any comment, he just didn’t get on the podium to be with a drug cheat, and I support that,” she said, calling for Wada and Fina to “do their job”.“At the moment, both of those (bodies) are fighting one another and Wada said he shouldn’t be swimming. We’ve been fighting for a clean sport for quite a number of years, its still hasn’t taken place. There’s still drug cheats out there and we want them banished.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83474f4dd834100153baacab90a8871f4589a6eb/31_40_2204_1322/master/2204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21335526a53d1b7ea69420b93cc459bb","title":"cricket england ireland lords test match day one live","story":"Never have I had so many emails, never have I had so little time to read and publish then, so let’s try and do a few – I’d best be seeing you fairweather wits while talking to myself at 3am, next time England go down-under: “In retrospect, Roy’s five not looking all that bad,” says Hubert O’Hearn.Much as we all want more, I suppose we have to call that a morning. I’ll be back presently for Ireland’s response in the meantime, here’s this week’s Spin on the particular joy of part0time bowlers snagging frontline batsmen.Uff marone! How do we make sense of this? Here’s Tim Murtagh! He says it’s a dream to play here and he’s not really sure what’s happened, then thanks all the other bowlers for their work. He says everything felt really good, the ball came out nicely, and there was just a bit in the wicket. He should know how to bowl on this ground, the pitch offered a bit both ways and some swing, and he had some good support at the other end. “A walk through the long room and a Lord’s lunch,” says Nasser “I might have some dessert as well,” says Murtagh. Glorious, wondrous, sensational stuff Ireland have been amazing, and England are world champions!And there it is! Adair slings down a fast, straight one, it cracks Stone on the elbow, careers into the stumps, and that’s three wickets on debut! England are the absolute height of England! 23rd over: England 85-9 (Stone 19, Leach 1) Adair returns – is he ginger? – is his nickname Red? He sends Stone a tempter, which he lashes to the fence making him England’s top-scorer ... I wonder what’s coming next....“I believe that this is the second time a bowler at Lords has got his name on the honours board before lunch on the 1st day,” emails Dan Seppings. “Tom Richardson got 6-39 when England played Australia in 1896. Australia were all out for 53 by lunch. So there you go, it’s not that bad…”23rd over: England 81-9 (Stone 15, Leach 1) And there’s your Cook replacement! Leach plays out a maiden from Rankin.“I just can’t get over the sheer breath-taking arrogance of the esteemed Gary Naylor (10:30am)”, says Harkan Sumal. ‘75-5 at lunch’ indeed. What larks! Between this and the antics down in Southampton (Hick XII vs Haddin XII), it looks like 2-day tests might be the modern fashion by the time the Ashes are done and dusted.”I’m looking forward to the first Test played in minus time. 22nd over: England 81-9 (Stone 15, Leach 1) Oh yes! Stone drives Thompson four through point and Athers notes how well Ireland have dragged the batsmen forward their lengths have been beautiful. But here Stone is again, watching the ball onto the bat and driving down the ground for four, then blocking a shorter one and crashing a drive to the extra cover fence! Is the search for an opening partner for Alastair Cook over?21st over: England 69-9 (Stone 3, Leach 1) If England are bowled out before lunch it’ll be the fourth time they’ve been dismissed in a session in a year – Dakar, Auckland and Trent Bridge are already on the roll of honour, with Bridgetown hosting a piddling nine wickets. Leach shoves a single into the leg side, then Stone eases behind for one. And there’s that short leg! Curran leans forward and turns directly into his hands which reminds us of how brilliantly Ireland have executed this morning. My fingers are typing but my head is spinning this is amazing. 20th over: England 67-8 (Curran 18, Stone 2) England have now blazed past their lowest ever total at Lord’s – 53 in 1888 – the beauty of central contracts. I guess it is hard for the players who won the world cup to relax into what’s happened and, more than that, to come to terms with the emotional peak and then how to respond to the comedown. The four who were in the squad made eight between them and, let’s be real, the other two dismissed aren’t necessarily Test-class. Six off the over.19th over: England 61-8 (Curran 14 , Stone 1) Now this is the can-do spirit our glorious leader was invoking: just when you think you’ve seen every conceivable aspect of conceited incompetence, another stunning wrinkle is revealed! Stone goes tentatively at his first ball and edges behind for one, then Curran top-edges two over the keeper’s head. Rankin comes around and bangs one in back of a length Broad lifts his bad above stump-height, feathers an edge, and the Irish backstop does the rest. This is basically Brexit in cricketing form. 19th over: England 58-7 (Curran 12, Broad 3) Murtagh’s spell of 9-2-13-5 comes to an end, as I wonder whether anyone’s ever got themselves onto the honour’s board before lunch on day 1. Anyway, Boyd Rankin has the ball – he and Nawab of Pataudi Snr are now the only men to play Tests for and against England – and after two dots, he asks for a short leg. And then he beats Broad, reckons there’s an edge, and when the umpire thinks to the contrary, requests a review! 18th over: England 58-7 (Curran 12, Broad 3) Curran allows Thompson to charge through a maiden, though he does hammer two drives directly to cover. It’s 58-7! “As your roving Paris-based Irish cricket nut,” says Robert Wilson, “may I appeal to other Irish fans not to crow too loudly about this morning’s work? It’s all too easy to revel in the crushing dismissal of Test minnows but it should be avoided. We need to be better than that. England are to be encouraged, nurtured and admired for their moxie and courage. I personally dislike these flagrant mismatches. It takes all the grandeur out of it. I think the English boys look very nice in their whites and they all appear to know the rules. That’s not nothing.”Just wait till you hear about the lunch they’ve laid on. 17th over: England 58-7 (Curran 12, Broad 3) Murtagh takes one more as we try to calm down and wonder: what is it with these? The shots we see them playing suggests technical frailty, but the frequency with which this happens suggests mental fragility. Except we’ve seen some of them win matches against India, New Zealand, Australia and New Zealand again, all in a row row row, to win a world cup. I don’t know, but by next week they need to find an answer for a problem that’s been bothersome for three years. Anyway, two off the over and that’s drinks - England look like they’ve had a skinful already. 16th over: England 56-7 (Curran 12, Broad 1) It is six million degrees in London today, but sat on the balcony, Joe Root is wearing a long-sleeved top that’s chilling he’s finding this, how cold he must be with great vengeance and furious anger. Luckily, he has Scurran, who clatters four through cover then glances four more through third man. This takes England to their half-century and beyond their lowest-ever Test score, a supremacy Scurran immediately presses home with three more down the ground. The runs are flowing now! And there’s another, Broad nudging to point. Oldest seamers to take a Test five-for since the war:“One reason I was so delighted with Shane Lowry winning The Open,” says Hubert O’Hearn, “was that the good feelings would balance out the tonking surely to be delivered at Lord’s by England. Instead, this!?! We win the golf, storming the cricket, and I’d make a comment about the Dail being more stable than Westminster but I’m not chancing our luck.”I was more stable than Westminster during the aforementioned teenage years. 15th over: England 43-7 (Curran 1, Broad 0) I feel bad for giving England’s comparatively prolific top order grief - that’s three middle-order ducks in a row, making it six wickets lost for seven runs scored. You’ve got to hand it to England, you’d think after decades of collapses we’d have seen it all, but they keep finding ways to reinvent themselves, like Bowie, Radiohead and Dylan all mixed. Murtagh hammers Broad on the pad, but this one pitched outside the line. Maiden, giving Murtagh figures of 8-2-11-5! Unbelievable and believable at the same time. “Just wondering if four days may be too long,” says Kim Thonger. “This might be over in four hours.”IT’S FIVE FOR MURTAGH! IT’S SEVEN FOR IRELAND! IT’S HUMILIATION FOR ENGLAND! IT’S WONDERFUL FOR CRICKET! Murtagh amazes Moeen by bowling a straight one, and Moeen amazes the world by studiously and deliberately edging it behind. Glorious! Sensational! Test cricket! 15th over: England 43-6 (Ali 0, Curran 1) This is better from England, we’ve not had a wicket for an entire seven balls. 14th over: England 42-6 (Ali 0, Curran 0) I said earlier that Curran has timing, and he dug England out of some pits last summer let’s see what he’s got now. Can he bat at 1-6? This is a proper back to tha old skool from England, and I’m absolutely lapping it up. I feel like I’m 15 again, and as such am smoking a Regal out the window while guzzling an Irn Bru bar, straightening my curtains and listening to jungle. I strongly suggest that you do the same. A maiden for Adair, and how long can these two keep at it? 13th over: England 42-6 (Ali 0, Curran 0) What more can this game do to amaze us?! Woakes was caught on the back pad by a wobbler, tight to the stumps, and the ball was trimming middle and leg! Oh yes! Shut up! Shut - up! Woakes is done by a nip-backer, but reviews....13th over: England 42-5 (Ali 0, Woakes 0) Here’s one for all those fancying Woakes as a three. Ahahahahahahahahahah! You have got to laugh! You can only laugh! This is wonderful, amazing, disgraceful, hilarious, affirming, pathetic, inspiring, affirming and affirming! Murtagh bowls straight, Bairstow baristwos a ludicrously dunderheaded airy drive, and C-R-A-S-H! 13th over: England 42-4 (Bairstow 0, Ali 0) Well, at least Moeen can be trusted to bat sensibly. It’s funny really, when England were in trouble during the world cup, your Rob Smyths, Rob Bagchis and me were discussing how much of our distress, if it went wrong, was having invested in the goal while sitting through Vizag, Auckland and the rest. I wondered if that now they’re world champions, these collapses would be less nauseating, but can confirm that much as this is a joy to narrate because Ireland are fantastic and this is so, so good for the game, it remains as majestically nauseating as ever it did.OH MY DAYS! OH MY ABSOLUTE DAYS! IRELAND ARE HAVING A DAY OUT, ENGLAND ARE HAVING AN ENGLAND! There were two noises: the ball hitting the front pad, then the ball hitting the back pad! As the whoops begin from the fielding side, the umpire is ordered to reverse his decision because the ball is cleansing the stumps, and this is astonishing! Ireland have bowled superbly! England still do not know how to bat in Test cricket! 12th over: England 42-3 (Root 2, Bairstow 0) This looking like a good toss to lose - Ireland were totally tempted to bowl, but I’d be amazed if they weren’t also worried about inserting England only to find the score 270-2 at tea. Adair charges in again and Root does his third man thing to the tune of two he then crumps the pad and four byes follow, then again! This one is proper straight! But was there a little edge? When the umpire rejects and wild appeal - and what a joy that is - Adair reviews! 11th over: England 36-3 (Root 0, Bairstow 0) Well, at least we can rely on Bairstow to play the situation. Murtagh charges in, Bairstow pulls away, and the stumps go all over. “I am following your coverage from the hospital library where I am reviewing x-rays,” says Chris Busby. The ac is just about coping but I am dreading the operating list this afternoon. It’s going to be a sweaty one. I am in standard junior doctor attire: chinos and a blue shirt, no tie.”I think chinos are on the banned list but worry not – soon we won’t have hospitals and other such fripperies, as we impose our can-do attitude upon the grateful world, dude. Or or Your Dudeness … Duder … or El Duderino, if, you know, you’re not into the whole brevity thing.HAVE A LOOK! Burns’ shonky technique gets him into all sorts here - his bat waves all over the show and his feet ramble to Camden and back before one gets the wrong side of the other, bat slanting to mid on, and he drives only to edge behind! This is brilliant! 11th over: England 36-2 (Burns 6, Root 0) These spells must be taking it right out of the bowlers - the weather in this country clearly understands irony, because it’s absolutely glorious. 10th over: England 36-2 (Burns 6, Root 0) Adair forces one past Root’s outside edge as he pretends to play inside the line. This is riveting stuff. “I like Joe Denly,” says Matthew Potter, “but surely if we’re giving the Roy experience a go, he is better at 3 and Denly could miss out? If I were a selector (there’s an almost infinite list of reasons why not - particularly a burning desire to see James Hildreth get an England cap) I’d have opened with Sibley and Burns, with Roy at 3 and so on... I also think Gregory should have got a game with Woakes being rested, as this Test seems a great opportunity to blood players and he definitely deserves it.”I’m not sure there’s much difference between opening and batting three, but I do take your point. If I’m honest, I’m yet to see a Test-class batsman in Denly, and I’m afraid i don’t watch enough country cricket to be sure about Sibley. As for Burns, he looks like he’s got the mental gear, but I wonder if he’s got the game to thrive against the best.

He says the temperature on the road is a whopping 41 degrees, which is having a big effect on the teams, who are constantly shuttling bottles of water to their top riders. Apparently the average water consumption yesterday was 22 bottles per rider, in order to stave off dehydration.It is understood that Richard Carapaz has signed a three-year deal with Team Ineos, whilst Quintana has been linked over the past few months with Arkea-Samsic for 2020. Quintana will join André Greipel, who has also had a poor Tour, and has been conspicuous by his absence. Interesting what that might mean for Movistar. They are a Spanish team of course, but the majority of their support and revenue does come from Quintana’s profile in South America. The Colombian is not in the running for the GC – running in 12th, 9:30 down on race leader Alaphilippe – but remains a top rider and is still just 29 years young. Interesting if they go for a Spanish replacement. 126km to go: Michael Butler will now take the ’s yellow jersey for a little while. I’m off into the heat of King’s Cross for a sandwich.130.5km to go: Meant to add that Andrea Pasqualon has taken today’s intermediate sprint points, with De Gendt second.This is copied from elsewhere – but here is the full list:Daniel Oss and Lukas Pöstlberger (Bora-Hansgrohe), Kasper Asgreen (Deceuninck-Quick Step), Alexis Gougeard (Ag2R-La Mondiale), Dylan Teuns (Bahrain-Merida), Nelson Oliveira (Movistar), Omar Fraile and Gorka Izagirre (Astana), Simon Clarke and Tom Scully (EF Education First), Chris Juul-Jensen and Matteo Trentin (Mitchelton-Scott), Greg van Avermaet and Michael Schär (CCC), Sven Erik Bystrom, Rui Costa, Sergio Henao and Vegard Stake Laengen (UAE Team Emirates), Bauke Mollema, Thomas Skujins and Jasper Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo), Nicolas Roche (Sunweb), Natnael Berhane, Jesús Herrada, Anthony Pérez and Pierre-Luc Périchon (Cofidis), Thomas de Gendt and Jens Keukeleire (Lotto-Soudal), Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin), Xandro Meurisse and Andrea Pasqualon (Wanty-Groupe Gobert), Edvald Boasson Hagen and Ben King (Dimension Data).136km to go: We’re not a million miles from the day’s first climb. Enter Pinot ... ?139km to go: The gap is now at five and a half minutes so we’re probably looking at two races in one here.140km to go: “Sadly one of my memories of ‘Local Food’ in that region is visiting the Haribo factory and compulsory shop. I think we left with several kilos of the stuff. Unsurprisingly most of my family became vegan shortly afterwards,” writes Dene Brown. Send more of your southern-French holiday calamities this way. It’s not all languedoc and boeuf en daube.Not a bad shout – and not a name we’ve heard a lot of so far today.145km to go: Average pace so far is 51.45km per hour. Phew! But it seems to be dropping off a bit as the riders cool down. They have covered a heck of a lot of ground in this first hour.149km to go: Paul Griffin writes – “Can’t help but feel your esteemed publication is missing a trick not press-ganging a sommelierbon vivantepicirurist to add mouthwatering comment on local wine, beer, obscure semi-lethal spirits and aperitifs pungent cheeses, deliciously unhealthy patisserie, diligently roasted birds and quadrupeds, and all the other extraordinary comestibles and indeed eateries the route of the tour passes. Interesting in itself and certainly beats wikipedia-ing one horse towns on the quiet days. Not that every dispatch from you and colleagues isn’t absolutely riveting. But this would even more so. You could even do something on pulses for the vegans.”Simon Burnton would have been your man for that. Hopefully you’ll hear more from him later on in the Tour. I can speak well of the wines and cheese from this region myself, having holidayed in a delightful farmhouse in Goult a few years back – but genuine detail is what the public demand and should get!151km to go: The breakaway is now about 2 min 48 sec ahead. Those who missed it have very much missed out.Yes, there’s currently rather more going on in the cricket! And that’s true about survival, definitely. Not many sightings of Pinot here yet, or any of the other really big guns, but we’ll know a lot more once we start going sharply uphill.155km to go: We have some big names in the break, and I have mentioned a few, but I haven’t mentioned Xandro Meurisse – who is 19th in the standings and is its highest-ranked member. They are now nearly two and a half minutes ahead. It’s a lightning start here.160km to go: The break are currently rattling along at 51km per hour, the peloton at 48km per hour. There are still more than 30 of them. How many will sustain this?164km to go: The gap is now just below two minutes! They really aren’t slacking up at the front! Looks like we have our breakaway for the next few hours, barring something very strange.165km to go: We now see the beautiful “Theatre Antique” in Orange. It’s quite a structure, which shortly will hold its annual opera and classical music festival.169km to go: The gap is now around 94 seconds the peloton is just about retaining its form as we stand but it will surely want to start closing shortly.173km to go: Magnus Cort Nielsen – who was riding in the break – has picked up a flat tyre, I believe.174km to go: Two riders – I can’t see who – have broken off the front of the peloton to give chase. I’m not sure it’s for the best if things break up now.176km to go: The gap is up beyond a minute now – it’s getting stretched.177km to go: Van Avermaet has not made many headlines yet in this Tour could today be the day that changes? He is down at 34th in the classification but has begun full of purpose here.179km to go: The break’s lead is holding at around 44 seconds now. That doesn’t make it unchaseable.181km to go: On the television we are learning about the local wine. They use 16 different types of grape in the region currently being passed through! I have holidayed there before but was shamefully un-studious when doing so.184km to go: That big break group are around 41 seconds ahead at the moment. De Gendt is in there, so is Rui Costa, so is Greg Van Avermaet.190km to go: I wonder if they can keep this pace up. We have a group of around 30 riders ahead of the peloton. The going is flat for the foreseeable so maybe it’s a good idea to get some distance in the bank before things get trickier.195km to go: Six riders setting a rapid pace here, with Thomas de Gendt starting very quickly, while we’re treated to some sublime views of Avignon.197.6km to go: A bit of housekeeping – we have two non-starters today. They are Luis Leon Sanchez of Astana and Cees Bol of Sunweb.Alaphillipe has held the yellow jersey for 12 days. Will he keep it or will we see a new leader after a stage to Gap for the first time in the Tour’s history?Fifteen of the 22 teams are yet to win in this Tour – chew on that as we prepare to start.We are just over 3km from the official start ... so it looks as if we are to begin on time.“Why the *incredible* when describing Julian Alaphillipe?” asks Richard Parker. Why not? He’s been brilliant. I used the stars for emphasis.It’s going to be an aesthetically *beautiful* stage, this, by the way – we have to drop that in. I’m already savouring the views of the Pont du Gard. We are in for a treat!Geraint Thomas suffered a bit of a tumble yesterday, of course, and fortunately didn’t come out much the worse for it. Here’s how Jeremy Whittle saw the day’s action, if you need to refresh:“Is JA cracking at last, or just looking slightly mortal?” asks Ian Miles. He means Alaphilippe, of course, who has put such an *incredible * amount into this Tour and now has one of those difficult leads – enough to give those chasing him a major headache but sufficiently slim that one mistake could ruin everything. Is he cracking? I’m going for the “mortal” option.Today’s fun should start in a little over half an hour – at 11.40am UK time.We’re looking at about 39 degrees, I’m told, in this 17th of the 21 stages – it’s going to be a really attritional test of endurance that could be absolutely pivotal in deciding what has been a fantastic Tour de France so far. Geraint Thomas remains hot on the heels of Julian Alaphilippe – one minute, 35 seconds behind as we go into today’s action – with Steven Kruijswijk, Thaibaut Pinot, Egan Bernal and Emanuel Buchmann all not far behind. Bernal says he feels ready for mountain stages that he believes are “more the Colombian style of climbing” – handy, given that he is Colombian. While there was little shakeup in the general classification yesterday, you sense there might be a twist or two here. Stay tuned ...A horrible stage for anyone who is merely trying to survive to Paris, as it’s going to be long, hot, largely uphill, and probably with cross-winds in the opening kilometres where the break will form. This is the last stage where a breakaway specialist who isn’t a pure climber can win usually about half the teams still need a stage win by this point so the first hour could be very hectic. The finish could go to a rider from the break or a sprinter who can climb such Peter Sagan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4540acfb78ac64f564c044491114eefce38298ea/610_496_2802_1682/master/2802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad00cf688e41c7ea0eacedd6cf9e2a9a","title":"amazon echo show 5 review smaller cheaper alexa display","story":"Camera shutter, tap gesture, better speakers and 5.5in screen make for an appealing smart alarm clockAmazon’s latest Echo Show 5 Alexa smart display is smaller, cheaper and has improved privacy, but is a £79.99 5.5in screen with a camera ready to replace your alarm clock in the bedroom?While the Show 5 is not cute like the Spot, its rectangular shape makes it more practical for displaying content, even if it takes up a third more horizontal space on your bedside table.The new Alexa display looks like Amazon’s 10.1in Echo Show hit with a shrink ray, replete with a fabric-covered back that is reminiscent of pre-flatscreen tube televisions. On the back, there’s a 3.5mm headphones socket for connecting an external speaker, a power socket and a microUSB socket. The 5.5in screen isn’t HD and has large bezels around the sides, but it is bright and crisp enough for across-the-room viewing.Photos and information panels look great, but you won’t want to watch too much video because the screen is just a bit too small for anything serious. A quick instructional video is fine, but TV and movies are a hard watch. Most smartphones now have bigger screens than the Show 5.Along the top there’s a mute button that turns off the mic and camera, volume buttons and, in a first for Amazon, there’s a physical slider that both covers and electrically disconnects the included 720p camera. Apart from testing video calls, I closed the shutter and forgot about it. In a place like the bedroom, having that physical shield across the lens gives you reassurance that no one can watch you without your knowledge – something the Spot lacked. Even with the camera covered there are still the privacy implications of having something that can listen to you in the bedroom, even if it’s only for the wakeword, which really comes down to how much you trust Amazon.The speakers on the Show 5 are a vast improvement in volume, bass response and clarity compared with all of Amazon’s smallest Echoes. I was genuinely surprised by how good it sounded. It still can’t hold a candle to a good speaker, or even the much larger Echo Show, but Alexa sounds really good and I enjoyed listening to music on it.Given it’s an Alexa smart display, the Show 5 can do all the things every other Amazon display or smart speaker can – set timers, answer questions, give you the weather, news and videos, display your calendar, and act as a digital photo frame, plus all the third-party skills such as listening to  headlines.New for the Show 5 are tweaks to how alarms work. You can set your usual alarms for anything, but for those for between 4am and 9am you can also get the display to gradually brighten to simulate a sunrise. Banging the top of the Show 5 when an alarm goes off snoozes it, but unfortunately you can’t dismiss an alarm entirely with your strikes.I found the sunrise feature wasn’t bright enough to do anything useful for my particular routine. It was already lighter in my bedroom than the Show 5 was ever going to make it, but those who sleep in total darkness might appreciate it.During the day you can set your choice from a variety of analogue and digital clock and background styles, including your selection of personal photos. At night the display can be set to switch to a dedicated “night mode” either on a schedule or when it’s dark, switching the screen to a dim red clock on a black background reminiscent of 90s alarm clocks.Also included on the Show 5 is a pop-out panel that gives quick access to messaging, recently played music, Amazon Video, alarms, Alexa routines and your smart home devices, as well as a load of suggestions for things you can do with Alexa.Swipe in from the right on any screen to access it, allowing you to quickly switch off lights in groups or inidually, for example. Alexa routines allow you to perform several actions when you say a keyword, or using the panel, tap a button. The standard ones are “good night” to switch everything off, and “good morning” to announce what’s on your calendar, the news and other bits.The Echo Show 5 is the Echo Dot of smart displays. It’s smaller, cheaper and does most of the things you want from a smart display. But like the Echo Dot, when you try to use it more for entertainment it begins to fall down.You can watch videos on it, but you won’t want to for long because of the tiny screen. If you stick to alarms, information and smart home control the Show 5 excels for £80, or likely less in one of Amazon’s frequent sales. And that’s the point of the Show 5 – the cheapest full smart display going that gets the best out of Alexa.If you feel comfortable having an Alexa smart speaker in your bedroom, amid perceived privacy concerns, and you want a screen for a clock, then the £80 or less Show 5 is the logical choice.The Echo Spot is smaller and cuter, but the Show 5’s camera cover and easier smart home control have earned it a place on my bedside table.Pros: relatively compact, sounds good, Alexa, good smart home control, 3.5mm output, extra clock and alarm features, relatively low costCons: too small to watch long videos, fairly big on your bedside table, large bezels around screen, screen isn’t HD, can’t stand vertically This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Update your drinking habits with tips from the experts on enjoying rum’s craft revivalWhile gin has had a dramatic rise in popularity over the past five years, bartenders have been quietly getting excited about rum. It offers huge cocktail variety, depending on the style from the unaged white variety to those aged in the tropics, it’s as complex and nuanced as any other spirit. I spoke to some top mixologists about their favourite cocktails.Jack Wallis and Chris Tanner at the VaultRum cocktails range from the super-simple to concoctions worthy of Michelin stars. Jack Wallis, operations manager at the Vault in Soho, is proud of the simplicity of their Captain’s Blood – a twist on a daiquiri, made with rum, fresh lime, sugar syrup and bitters that’s perfect to serve at home. For something a little more complex, Chris Tanner, also of the Vault, makes a version of Planter’s Punch with orange, pineapple, lime juice, grenadine, sugar syrup and Lugger Rum. Unlike some varieties, Lugger Rum is not dominated by vanilla, aiming instead to deliver a full profile of spices, including nutmeg, orange peel and cloves.Liam Cotter of Heads, Hearts and TailsBarman Liam Cotter, of events and consultancy firm Heads, Hearts and Tails, warns not to take shortcuts in rum-based cocktails: “Inexperienced bartenders may swap out a quality rum with an inferior one and wonder why their grog isn’t quite the same.” Cotter’s all-time favourite cocktail is a Jungle Bird not the original 1970s version, created in the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, but the reimagined New York classic, created by way of Giuseppe Gonzales (formerly of New York’s Suffolk Arms and long-standing patron of Milk \u0026amp Honey). He reworked it to become infinitely more balanced and appealing to a refined contemporary palate. It’s part all-night-fun negroni, part complex bitter daiquiri. He thinks this would be great with Lugger Rum.He also has a soft spot for something more straightforward: “There is something lovely about a simple rum and coke.”Mia Johansson at SwiftLondon bar Swift is known for its elegant and inventive cocktails, and one of managing partner Mia Johansson’s favourites is a Praline Flip. First, they make their own hazelnut orgeat – by heating the nuts in water, cooling and re-blending them – then combine with Angostura bitters, egg, Guinness and spiced rum. Their second cocktail is a little less complicated, but still one I wouldn’t try at home. It’s an espresso martini using Mr Black cold-brew coffee liqueur, coffee, vodka, rich demerara sugar and spiced rum.Thom Solberg at Black RockBlack Rock’s bar manager Thom Solberg loves a Mai Tai. Although this award-winning Shoreditch bar primarily focuses on whisky, it also works with rum. Solberg’s take on his retro favourite uses three rums – Jamaican, Lugger spiced and over-proof – along with triple sec and lime juice. All it needs is shaking up, pouring over ice and a garnish of orange and mint. He says spiced rum goes well with anything apple-y, and that a particular favourite rum modifier is pomegranate molasses. He incorporates this mix into a rum punch alongside dry cider, lime, allspice dram and a little vanilla syrup, garnished with cinnamon, nutmeg and apple slices.Kurt Maitland, cocktail authorKurt Maitland, author of Drink, can recommend something simple and something more showy. A Devil’s Kiss won’t tax you: shake up equal parts coffee liqueur, Grand Marnier and Lugger Rum with ice and strain into small glasses.The Kama’aina is a completely different kettle of fish, however. It starts with ginger syrup, almond paste and pimento liqueur, stirred to create a #9. Next add Rhum agricole, Lugger Rum, guava nectar, real cream of coconut, and fresh lime then shake with crushed ice and strain into a tiki glass, adding Angostura bitters and an orange blossom garnish at the end. Maitland describes a Devil’s Kiss as like an aperitif at home before the main drama of a complicated Kama’aina in a specialist bar. The former can easily be made in quantity for parties and the spiced rum balances beautifully with the bitter coffee and sweet Grand Marnier.Featuring fruit, spice and a genuinely fiery twist – careful with those matchesLugger rum 50mlStrawberry and lime syrup 20ml*Angostura bitters, 2 dashesWest country cider 30mlSprig of rosemarySpiced powder**MatchesStrawSugar 50gStrawberries x10Peeled lime skins (x2 whole limes)Juice of 1 whole limeIn a bowl, muddle all ingredients and leave for 10-30 minutes in fridge, then strain through a sieve.Mix equal parts of icing sugar, cinnamon powder and nutmeg powder.Lugger Rum is a Caribbean rum aged in Devon, featuring sophisticated notes of orange peel, nutmeg, cloves and vanilla.

The first of three female-led hour-long dramas written by Dominic Savage after collaborations with a trio of actors – Samantha Morton, Gemma Chan and, here, Vicky McClure – it was a subtle, onion-layered thing that peeled itself down to the truth over 60 tense, claustrophobic minutes.McClure plays Nicola, a hairdresser who initially seems to be chafing at the inevitable boredoms that creep into a long-term relationship. Her partner Adam (Perry Fitzpatrick) seems like a nice enough guy. As viewers, we lag only slightly behind Nicola in our reappraisal. If you have been there yourself, you will catch up slightly quicker. If you have watched a friend go through something similar, the sensation of watching her, trying to catch her attention, explain things to her as if through a thick pane of glass, will be rendered uncomfortably literal.Adam never hits her, although you feel the threat hovering on the horizon, particularly when he gets into a row at a barbecue at their friends’ house. The task Savage and his actors have set themselves is the much harder one of limning the intangible violence recently named and outlawed as “coercive control” – the emotional manipulation, the erosion of a supposedly loved one’s mental freedoms, the gentle battering of a psyche into submission.There is just something slightly off about him. About them. To compare where your spider-sense began tingling with that of friends from different backgrounds and different genders would be an interesting, illustrative exercise. When he chides her not to be “silly” when she mentions that she wants them to “do more shit together”? Or when he nudges her into cancelling a trip to the pub with a friend (“See them all day at work anyway, don’t you?”) Or is it his constant questioning – “Are you all right? I just want to make sure you’re all right” – that sets you off? Overwhelming concern, because its very purpose is to overwhelm. It’s impossible to clear enough space to think straight when anything is encroaching from all sides.All the scenes are closeups, the camera coming in at odd, choppy angles, evoking the pair’s mental bobbing and weaving as Adam seeks to box her in and Nicola tries to duck under his jabs or, too weary for another verbal sparring, slumps against the ropes in acquiescence. The dialogue is so naturalistic you would believe it was improvised on the spot, if their arguments weren’t such perfect replications of the real things – circular horrors that take place on shifting sands, so you return to a slightly worse place than the one you left.Both actors are brilliantly surefooted. Fitzpatrick pitches Adam’s toxicity just right, the bully resting just inches below the surface of his everyman facade, and the coward just an inch or two below that. #Notallmen, no – but so many more than you think or hope. And McClure is back on the This is Englandish ground that rightly made her name. She has, of course, become much more famous since via her turn as AC-12’s Kate Fleming in Line of Duty, but she is wasted in the role (particularly in the most recent series) and so much better suited to this kind of intimate, emotionally granular work that it is both a joy and a relief to see her flex her talents fully again.Her Nicola is wholly believable, wholly identifiable. Nicola has insight into her situation (“I’m not gonna lie,” she tells Adam in the wake of one of his wheedling apologies, this time after objecting to her tight gym clothes, “It’s weird. Alarm bells ring”) and his mindset. She tries to tell him, warn him, teach him – not because she is a pushover, but because she is normal normally kind, normally hopeful, and it takes time for these humane instincts to burn out and be replaced by the necessary toughness required to resist.There isn’t much in the way of plot. This is, above all, a mood piece. As with life, there is no dramatic or Damascene moment for Nicola – just a cumulative pressure, a coded message from a friend, a gradual admission that the scales of happiness are unignorably tipped. There is no neat resolution, but when Nicola finally leaves to spend a night at her mum’s (she had intended to leave for good, but Adam hints at suicide, so it is whittled down to a week and then a bare 24 hours), we see her walk across the family garden and smile. From the grin alone we may infer liberation.If you see yourself in any of it, listen to the alarm bells. When did you last smile freely?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f82f404830bd9e05b6f24192086acee611c84e8/0_147_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ba3e98a94eab707a405cd5c6e1d8f52","title":"flyboard inventor franky zapata record channel crossing","story":"Franky ‘Flyman’ Zapata set for takeoff on invention that wowed Macron and MerkelThe French hoverboard star Franky Zapata will attempt to cross the Channel on Thursday using the invention that wowed world leaders and Champs-Élysées crowds on Bastille Day.The former jetski champion will attempt to make the 20-minute crossing on his turbo-powered hoverboard – the Flyboard Air – to mark the 110th anniversary of French aviator Louis Blériot’s first cross-Channel airplane flight.Zapata, 40, nicknamed “Flyman” by French media, is expected to take off at the beach at Sangatte near Calais and land at an unspecified site near Dover.He will refuel halfway across, landing on a vessel in the middle of the Channel to change the 37kg backpack that contains kerosene for the Flyboard.Hours before the record-breaking attempt, Zapata appeared cautious about his chances of success. Asked if he was ready, he replied: “As ready as we can be”.“We’ve had to double the autonomy of the machine. It’s a little complicated … but we think we can do it,” he told RMC radio on Wednesday. Zapata said he wanted to “follow in the footsteps of the great aviation pioneers”.“I’ve always been fan of Blériot and I was looking for a new challenge. If we can cross the Channel on the 110 anniversary … it’s a crazy challenge.”Zapata added: “It’s a busy ferry lane. I will land on a boat in the middle of the Channel, change my (fuel) bag and take off again immediately.”French maritime authorities had initially refused to approve the flight, saying it was too dangerous to attempt over one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, but stopped short of a ban. On Wednesday, they had a change of heart.Coastal officials said they had approved the flight after Zapata had given them numerous guarantees.“He detailed his safety plan and his measures for refuelling at sea … this has allowed the maritime prefect to take a decision to lift the refusal to approve the crossing,” a spokesperson for the maritime prefecture said.Zapata impressed France with a demonstration of his Flyboard at this year’s Bastille Day parade in front of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Angela Merkel, along with other world leaders.“It’s the realisation of a dream,” the inventor told Le Parisien this week, adding that he was “very stressed”. He said the Bastille Day demonstration was easy by comparison.Zapata, from Marseille, made his first Flyboard flight three years ago. “I lost two fingers torn off in the turbines and the machine crashed into the wall of my workshop. After that, I had to really negotiate with my wife for her to let me get on it again,” he said in an interview.“But when I saw the machine fly I said this is what I have to do with my life. I have to see it through to the end”.On Wednesday, as he tested the Flyboard, Zapata said he expected to make the 22-mile (36km) crossing at an average speed of 87mph (140kmh) and at an an altitude of between 15-metre to 20-metre (50-65ft) above sea level.The French government’s defence and procurement agency awarded Zapata a €1.3m (£1.2m) grant to develop the hoverboard last December after the inventor was approached by foreign investors.The Flyboard Air is powered by five mini turbo engines, can run autonomously for about 10 minutes and reach speeds of up to 118mph.Florence Parly, the French armed forces minister, has said the machine could be tested for different kinds of uses, for example as a flying logistical platform or an assault platform."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef45acd0be8a4414eecf0f1500d3495a555aaf4/252_536_2996_1797/master/2996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9047f4e57e18a4b0cdb5eed72054f3b","title":"italy league money russia allegations discussed parliament","story":"Allegations far-right party in coalition accepted funding to be discussed in parliamentItaly’s prime minister will address the country’s senate on Wednesday to discuss allegations that the far-right League party sought money from Russia.Giuseppe Conte, a technocrat whose appointment was key to the brokering of a coalition between the League and the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), said he would speak to parliament after Matteo Salvini, the deputy prime minister and leader of the League, refused to bow to pressure from M5S to give a detailed response to the claims.Salvini said he would be willing to discuss the issue during the regular question time session. But early on Wednesday morning, it was unclear if Salvini would even be present, with reports suggesting he would not appear and his spokesperson unable to confirm either way. He has repeatedly denied his party has taken money from Russia, following reports earlier this month that one of his aides had allegedly endeavoured to strike an oil deal in a Moscow hotel that would have erted Russian funds to the League to bolster its campaigning before the European elections in May.There is no evidence that a deal was finalised, but the allegations, which initially emerged in February, led Italian prosecutors to open an investigation and raised questions about the relationship between the League and the Kremlin.“Finally, he is taking a more autonomous, authoritative position. He won’t attack Salvini, as that would be an attack against his government, but he will be seeking to reinforce his position.”Prof Mattia Diletti from Sapienza University in Rome said: “Salvini knows that Italian people don’t care too much about the Russiagate. He also knows if he answers to parliament, it would be negative for him. But he really doesn’t care about institutional etiquette, he only cares about communication and consensus.”Salvini has been nurturing ties with Russia since he became leader of the League in 2013 and has always made a show of his admiration for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.M5S is also Russia-friendly and in the past has faced accusations of being influenced by the Kremlin. Luigi Di Maio, the M5S leader and deputy prime minister, welcomed Putin alongside Salvini during the Russian leader’s state visit to Rome on 4 July. Conte also promised Putin that Italy would work towards helping mend Russia’s fractured relations with the EU.In this respect, while Conte will probably tell parliament there needs to be an investigation into the illegal funding allegations, he is unlikely to say anything tough about Russia.Russiagate aside, there are other issues threatening the coalition’s survival. The two partners have been at odds for months, with Salvini and Di Maio often trading insults and ultimately stalling progress on government policy. Speculation of an imminent government collapse was rife last week when Salvini declared he had lost all confidence in M5S, after the party backed Ursula von der Leyen to become president of the European commission.The League opposed the German candidate, snubbing an instruction from Conte for both parties to vote for her. Salvini accused M5S of betraying its promise to ordinary voters of bringing about radical change in Europe.Salvini and Di Maio had patched things up by Monday, but there is pressure on Salvini from within his ranks to seize on his popularity and pull the plug on an administration that some League ministers say has become untenable.Salvini has put the onus on the weakened M5S, threatening to quit unless the party drops its opposition towards key League policies, such as granting greater fiscal autonomy to the Lombardy and Veneto regions – the party’s strongholds.Conte has also taken control of this issue and is expected to present a proposal on Friday. By the same day, he must also decide on a contentious high-speed rail project linking Italy and France that M5S vehemently opposes and the League backs.But most analysts expect the government to at least make it as far as drafting its 2020 budget in the autumn, with a potential cabinet reshuffle taking place to ease tensions in the meantime. Salvini has called for the M5S transport minister, Danilo Toninelli, and the defence minister, Elisabetta Trenta, to go."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Hyde \u0026amp Seek owner leaves \u0026lsquofront line\u0026rsquo role after undercover RTE report reveals \u0026lsquoissues\u0026rsquoClimate advisory body says lack of plans to decarbonise a major obstacle to new policyFG member says Taoiseach \u0026lsquobottled it\u0026rsquo in not removing the whip over compensation claimSiptu calls for Bruton action after Offaly ESB plant refused permission to burn peat past 2020Britain could see record hottest day as Europe experiences scorching temperaturesFormer UUP leader Mike Nesbitt says unionism will not disappear in united IrelandRepeat objectors responsible for an almost-tenfold increase in such complaintsGroup calls for councils to use emergency powers to force through housing plansCatherine Byrne to present expert report that does not recommend decriminalisationFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader also claims report on Bailey case is \u0026lsquoinconsistent\u0026rsquoWill Boris the prime minister strike a different note from Boris the candidate?The 1810 mahogany house, once owned by Vivien Greene, had guide price of \u0026euro3,000-\u0026euro4,000She \u0026lsquoalways appeared bubbly and happy but it was a front . . . she was broken inside\u0026rsquoShake-up to change how the State spends money on projects that cost more than \u0026euro1bnData Protection Commissioner responds to OPW move to remove books over GDPR fearsAnalysis: Decision not to strip TD of whip seen by some TDs as missed opportunityHowever TD signed affidavit that \u0026lsquooverstated the impact of her injuries on her running\u0026rsquoElection of new Tory leader raises prospect of Michael Gove becoming Northern SecretaryFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says incoming UK PM \u0026lsquofailed to show\u0026rsquo understanding\u0026rsquo of Belfast AgreementJohnson as prime minister \u0026lsquoraises enormous fears\u0026rsquo for Anglo-Irish relations \u0026ndash Martin"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3965773.1563952175!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unionists could hold balance of power into perpetuity in all ireland parliament","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMike Nesbitt: ‘To coin a phrase, we aren’t going away, you know.’ File photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireUnionists could hold the balance of power into perpetuity in a united Ireland parliament, former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has claimed. Mr Nesbitt said he raised this issue with a senior political figure in Dublin last year who was “shocked” that unionists could be the “perpetual kingmakers in Dáil Éireann”. Mr Nesbitt contributed to Fianna Fáil senator Mark Daly’s research paper on unionist attitudes to a united Ireland that has just been published. Mr Nesbitt, who was Ulster Unionist leader between 2012 and 2017, said the senior political figure he spoke to was “taken aback” that political unionism would continue to exist even in the event of a united Ireland. “To coin a phrase, we aren’t going away, you know. The objectives of unionism might change, but the need to represent our people would be even more important than ever, and it is indeed possible that we could hold the balance of power in Leinster House on a frequent if not perpetual basis.” Mr Nesbitt stressed he was not speaking for the whole of unionism because “nobody does” and that even the DUP does not have a majority of unionist support. “It is increasingly accepted that the unionist warning that ‘home rule is Rome rule’ was accurate at the time, just as it is indisputable that it is no longer the case,” he wrote. “The Ireland of today is a progressive, pluralist country embracing previously unimaginable social policies like marriage equality and reproductive rights.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3965833.1563962988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the clown who wanted to be king what the papers say about boris","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe front pages of the UK’s Independent, France’s Liberation and the Evening standard. The UK’s incoming Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is the subject of editorials and comment pieces at home and abroad.“The Queen’s jester,” was the headline in France’s Libération as Boris Johnson prepared to enter No 10 Downing St.“He’ll start breaking his promises tomorrow,” warned Der Spiegel in Germany.In a scathing portrait of the new prime minister, Le Monde said Johnson was “known for his eccentricity, his elastic positions, his narcissism and his lies”. His “insatiable need to be liked and phenomenal aplomb” meant anything was possible, the paper said. “Boris Johnson has a rendezvous with history – his lifelong dream.”Libération said Johnson would “have to move fast to unveil his Brexit strategy” – something of a problem as “the possibilities open to him to keep his promise of leaving the EU by 31 October are extremely limited ... If the British government has changed, the obstacles remain the same.”In its portrait of the former London mayor, the paper said Johnson was “finally about to imitate his idol, Winston Churchill, by taking his country’s destiny in hand at a time of existential crisis. But he has promised not blood, toil, tears and sweat, but a brilliant future – because the UK is ‘a great country’.”Johnson “advances by the seat of his pants”, the paper said, “like a chameleon, adjusting his positions according to the moment, counting on his people skills and perhaps his luck. For long, his eccentricity and self-mockery – the essence of Englishness – saved him. That may no longer now be the case.”In Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung was equally brutal. “The clown who wanted to be king of the world” was its headline. Given Johnson’s well-known nonchalance and complete unpredictability, “Britain’s political drama is about to begin an act which will have its entire audience holding their breath.”Der Spiegel said Johnson had been “dreaming of this for decades. But once he begins his new life as prime minister, he will have to stand in front of the door to No 10 and explain to his compatriots what he actually plans to do. And at that moment, he will begin breaking his promises.”In recent weeks, the magazine said Johnson’s “one-of-a-kind talent for talking a lot without really saying anything” had allowed him to “pledge all kinds of things to just about everyone. He cannot keep all of them.” His charisma “has got him far”, it added. “Now he has to show he has powers of leadership, not just of seduction.”‘Send in the Tory clown’Die Welt said the hour of truth was fast approaching. “Johnson is about to enter No 10,” it said. “He must now prove he can master the country’s worst crisis since the second world war. It is not just the opposition that doubts he can.”The Dutch daily NRC Handelsblad said the new prime minister would soon learn that “what he promised as a candidate cannot be achieved as prime minister. Over the past few years, Boris Johnson has in his speeches and columns claimed that he knew far better than Theresa May. Now he’s going to have to negotiate.”The Daily Mail, which has long championed Mr Johnson, in its leader says Mr Johnson’s acceptance speech was fitting for the summer weather.It says: “Having finally secured the job he craved so desperately for so long, Boris Johnson’s acceptance speech yesterday was a typically bravura performance. Overflowing with optimism and bonhomie, he bathed the Tory faithful in balmy sunshine.”But the paper cautioned that despite the “stirring words, now the real work begins”.The Daily Mirror, which has never been Mr Johnson’s biggest supporter, titles its editorial: “Send in the Tory clown.”It goes on to says that the new prime minister “inhabits a weird, make-believe fantasy world in which truth is the enemy, struggling to be honest about Brexit or any issue requiring sound judgement”.The Daily  - which calls the new PM the “Dude” - contains a column from Philip Johnston pushing for “a snap election to replace this paralysed Parliament”.The paper’s editorial calls the change of prime minister “a new chapter after three wasted years”. It adds: “His first task is to construct a Cabinet with the expressed purpose of delivering Brexit by October 31st.”’s editorial warns that “With Boris Johnson as PM Britain faces a hard Brexit after years of a clown.”It adds: “The Conservative party has finally got a leader it deserves ... (Mr Johnson) faces the most daunting challenge - that of how the UK can leave the European Union - on entering No 10 since Winston Churchill in 1940.” columnist Rafael Behr writes of Mr Johnson that: “Ministers who witnessed the new Tory leader in action as foreign secretary testify to laziness, inattention to detail, contempt for relationships, congenital unseriousness and dangerous indiscretion.”While Sun columnist Trevor Kavanagh writes confidently that “Boris will lead the Tories to victory in the next general election and put Brexit to bed”.The Times’ editorial cautions that the Irish border remains a stumbling block.It says Mr Johnson “has assembled a wide coalition of opinion within his own party that has taken him to the highest office. Holding that coalition together while making concrete proposals about the Irish backstop might prove altogether more difficult.”‘An obscene ascent to power’Daniel Finkelstein, in an opinion column in The Times, says Mr Johnson’s best hope of survival is “gambling everything on going to the country”.Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel papers have also covered the new tenant at Number 10.Danish title Politiken carries a leader column which pulls no punches, claiming that Mr Johnson - like US president Donald Trump - has “built his entire career on shameless lies and extreme self-promotion”.Headlined “That a clown like Boris Johnson is set to become prime minister in the UK shows just how low the country has fallen since the Brexit referendum”, the column says British people deserve better leadership.“The British people deserve much, much better political leadership than what they’ve got. And now one of the worst is becoming prime minister.“Johnson’s victory is the epitome of injustice. It’s an obscene ascent to power.“Johnson has - not unlike US president Donald Trump - built his entire career on shameless lies and extreme self-promotion.”Swiss title Neue Zurcher Zeitung runs a column from its British correspondent Peter Nonnenmacher with the title: “He’s here - what now?”He writes: “It will not be easy for him. From the situation in which he has manoeuvred, there is no apparent way out.“With the solemn summoning of willpower and optimism alone, no state can be made. There must be more, much more.”Three Flemish language Belgian titles all make reference to Brexit in their coverage - De Morgen writes the EU is “not afraid of Johnson”, de Standaard says Johnson “had 100 days”-— a reference to the Brexit deadline of October 31st - and De Tijd writes “The loot has been secured”.The , in a strident editorial, refers to Johnson’s elevation as “a new nadir” for the UK.It says the best hope for Ireland, Europe and “British citizens themselves — is that Johnson as prime minister will be guided by three of his worst traits, which together have defined his career: he doesn’t mean a word he says, he is obsessed with power and he is willing to betray those closest to him in the pursuit of that power.”–PA and "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Boris Johnson \u0026#39to sack Jeremy Hunt as Foreign Secretary\u0026#39 as May tells Corbyn \u0026#39I knew my time was up - so should you\u0026#39 Heathrow passengers forced to take summer holidays without their luggageUK heatwave: Thursday could be Britain\u0026#39s hottest day on record, Met Office says, after lightning battered UKVegan food and no booze: how Boris is prepping for the top jobComment: Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings is the man to help Boris take back control of BrexitRemote control car bomb plotter jailed for 15 yearsChina says army can be deployed at Hong Kong\u0026#39s requestRemarkable comebacks, great survivors and rising stars: the key figures set to be in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s first CabinetSix graphs that show why Boris will find it tough to deliver on his Brexit promiseHospital where Neil Armstrong died paid $6 million to family in secret settlement over medical malpracticeBoris Johnson to meet Donald Trump three times in first 100 days in office as US president praises himWho should be in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Cabinet?

The troop is responsible for defence duties in Hong Kong and safeguarding national sovereignty. Hong Kong government documents have estimated the number of troops is between 8,000 to 10,000 personnel. Beijing has been monitoring the situation in Hong Kong from a distance and remained hands-off during last month’s mass demonstrations. The news of mass demonstrations in Hong Kong was downplayed in Chinese media. The central government offered moral support to the Hong Kong government and its police force handling weeks of social disorder. But Beijing’s response has turned tougher this week after the protesters besieged the central government office in Hong Kong, which is a symbol of Beijing’s sovereignty over the city. The vandalism has irked Beijing. Chinese media aired images of a defaced national emblem on state broadcast news on Tuesday, and state newspapers run editorials condemning the vandalism. They referred to the radical protesters as anarchists who directly challenge China’s governing framework in Hong Kong and the central government’s authority. China on Wednesday also blamed the US behind the public unrest in Hong Kong and warned against foreign interference, after Sunday’s vandalism. “We can see that US officials are even behind such incidents,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying at a regular press briefing on Tuesday.The Chinese foreign ministry has reiterated that Hong Kong’s affairs are China’s internal affairs. Hua, asked about criticism of violence by the United States and Hong Kong’s former colonial ruler, Britain, said China would not tolerate any interference.“The US should know one thing, that Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong, and we do not allow any foreign interference,” she said.“We advise the US to withdraw their black hands.”Iran\u0026#39s president offers Britain a quid pro quo to resolve tanker standoffBoris Johnson \u0026#39to sack Jeremy Hunt as Foreign Secretary\u0026#39 as May tells Corbyn \u0026#39I knew my time was up - so should you\u0026#39 Heathrow passengers forced to take summer holidays without their luggageUK heatwave: Thursday could be Britain\u0026#39s hottest day on record, Met Office says, after lightning battered UKVegan food and no booze: how Boris is prepping for the top jobComment: Vote Leave mastermind Dominic Cummings is the man to help Boris take back control of BrexitRemote control car bomb plotter jailed for 15 yearsRemarkable comebacks, great survivors and rising stars: the key figures set to be in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s first CabinetSix graphs that show why Boris will find it tough to deliver on his Brexit promiseHospital where Neil Armstrong died paid $6 million to family in secret settlement over medical malpracticeBoris Johnson to meet Donald Trump three times in first 100 days in office as US president praises himWho should be in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s Cabinet?

The Met Office had said on Tuesday it could remain as high as 24C (75.2F) during the night for parts of south east England.Night-time temperatures are measured by taking the minimum temperature across a 24-hour period, as the lowest point tends to fall during the early hours of the morning. By Wednesday morning, much of the country was already experiencing temperatures far above normal for this time of year.Quite a lot of places are back up to 23 or 24 degrees already (at 5am), Met Office meteorologist Emma Smith said. It\u0027s normally 13 or 14 degrees at this time of year, so that\u0027s 10 degrees above average.While the record didn\u0027t appear to have been broken on Tuesday night, Ms Smith said there was a possibility it would be beaten on Thursday night into Friday.During the day on Tuesday, temperatures across England had exceeded 30C (86F) - the highest recorded was in Northolt, London, where the mercury hit 33.7C.In Kent, where the temperature soared to 32C (89.2F), more than 100 firefighters, 20 fire engines and a variety of specialist support vehicles worked to control a fire on the Lydd Ranges.In London, meanwhile, police have pulled a body from the Thames in a search for three people who had gone missing in the river.The politan Police said a swimmer went missing at Shadwell Basin on Tuesday evening, a second at Waterloo Bridge and a third near Kingston High Street.The South Wales Fire and Rescue Service warned people not to leave fans on overnight, or if they are out of the house.Other hotspots on Tuesday included Cardiff and Watnall, Nottinghamshire, where the mercury rose to 30C (86F).How to cope in hot weatherTrain company Southeastern said it would be running a significantly reduced service on Thursday due to speed restrictions announced by Network Rail.Southeastern operates trains in south-east London and Kent and also serves parts of East Sussex.Rail passengers also faced delays and cancellations after lightning strikes damaged signalling equipment.ScotRail said there was disruption on the Highland mainline and far north line early on Wednesday following stormy weather.Passengers travelling on Caledonian Sleeper services also faced delays after lightning strikes damaged signalling equipment in the north of England.On the roads, gritters could be sent out to spread salt and help stop the tarmac from melting under the extreme heat.The Met Office said there was a \u0026#34small chance\u0026#34 of damage to property from lightning strikePolice looking for a man who vanished while swimming in Shadwell Basin in east London have recovered a body.The man, 23, was with friends at the site in Garnet Street shortly after 6pm on Tuesday and was seen entering the water, but did not resurface.A body, believed to be the same man, was recovered at 9.45am on Wednesday after searches by the politan Police marine unit. His family has been told.Police continue to search for two other men who are also missing after going swimming in the Thames on Tuesday evening.Following three reported deaths from drowning on the River thames on Tuesday 23 July as a heatwave grips the UK, a body is recovered by police ers at Shadwell Basin in WappingThere were reports of a person in difficulty in the water near Waterloo Bridge at about 8.30pm, while another search is taking place in Kingston, south-west London, where a second man was seen in the river.Of the incident at Shadwell Basin, police said: The man was swimming with friends and has not resurfaced.Officers and the marine policing unit attended along with other emergency service personnel and are searching the area.Just yards from where a body was pulled from the River Thames, youths ignore the no swimming signsOn Tuesday, a body was found at a water park after reports that a swimmer had disappeared in a lake in Gloucestershire.Emergency services were called to Cotswold Water Park, near Cirencester, at around 1.40pm on Tuesday following reports a swimmer had gone missing.Joanne Pendlebury, from Waterland Outdoor Pursuits which owns part of the lake, said the man was looking for his missing dog.Police, fire and ambulance crews were at the site, with a National Police Air Service helicopter scrambled to help search for the swimmer.Gloucestershire Police said the body of a man was pulled from the water shortly before 8.50pm.He was pronounced dead at the scene and the coroner and the man\u0027s next of kin have been informed, the force added.Sisters Ebony, 11, and Isobella, 8, cool off in the river at Brockenhurst in the New Forest A child sits in the sun by The Friendly Giant, a pond sculpture situated in Alnwick Gardens in Anwick, NorthumberlandSeagulls e-bomb a member of the public on the beach at Lyme Regis in Dorset Lord\u0026#39s bathed in sunshine as Ireland dominate England in the first Test match between the two nationsWant the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

That’s especially true of her directorial debut, 2000’s Love \u0026amp Basketball, in which Monica (Sanaa Lathan) loses her virginity to childhood sweetheart, Quincy (Omar Epps).Alfonso Cuarón’s raucous classic inverts the American sex comedy: Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) are stereotypical, sex-obsessed young men distraught at the concept of their girlfriends leaving the country. Choosing to live as bachelors, they befriend an older woman (Maribel Verdú), who seduces both of them. Yet, the film drives them towards one, real truth: their own bisexuality, finally freed during the film’s famous threesome.God’s Own Country star Alec Secareanu admitted he was initially “very afraid” of the kinds of scenes he would be tasked with filming for the gay drama film. “But the way each character has sex tells a lot about them the way that they develop their relationship,” he told Attitude.A film that finds its eroticism in small gestures - in the languid rest of a glove, in a glance, shared across a crowded room - when it comes to director Todd Haynes actually filming the first time Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) have sex, their chemistry is already so palpable that the moment feels nothing short of explosive. Barry Jenkins’ Oscar-winner is one of the most tender depictions of yearning in modern cinema. Its protagonist Chiron (played by Ashton Sanders here, at other points by Alex R. Hibbert and Trevante Rhodes) experiences his first sexual encounter with fellow student Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) on a quiet, isolated beach. Their fumbling may pay testament to the awkwardness of a teenager’s first experiences, but Jenkins’ approach also gives the moment a profound grace, and an acknowledgement of how it will come to shape Chiron’s own view of himself. Much like Blue Valentine, Nicolas Roeg’s 1973 classic swiftly faced controversy due to a sex scene so emotionally faithful (while also depicting a female character, Julie Christie’s Laura, receiving oral sex), that it caused clashes with censors. A grieving couple desperately holding onto the shreds of their marriage after the death of their child, Laura and John (Donald Sutherland)’s raw emotions and vulnerability in this moment are famously intercut with post-coital preparations to go to dinner - an attempt, in fact, to satiate censors. Sex is funny, sometimes hilarious. There’s no getting through this list without acknowledging that fact, and there’s no better film to summarise it than Team America: World Police and its infamous puppet intercourse, enthusiastically filing through every sexual position in the book.Trust David Lynch to create a highly-charged sex scene that inevitably only becomes part of the web created to deceive and befuddle us. Rita (Laura Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts) may consummate their bubbling affections for each other in a sensuous, dreamlike manner - but who is Rita in this moment? Who is Betty? Is this encounter real or imagined?One of the finest examples of the erotic thriller, director Adrian Lyne depicts the extramarital affair in its full urgency, its entire spectrum of conflicted emotions, as suburban housewife Connie (Diane Lane) becomes enraptured by a handsome young Frenchman (Olivier Martinez). Derek Cianfrance dared to portray sex with any sense of realism, both physically and emotionally, only to quickly get slapped with an NC-17 rating for showing Michelle Williams’ character, Cindy, on the receiving end of oral sex. “The sex felt real - it wasn\u0027t sexy or \u0027a sex scene\u0027, and that\u0027s why we got into trouble,” co-star Ryan Gosling remarked to The Observer at the time. “You shouldn\u0027t be penalised for doing a good job.”Gina Prince-Bythewood has masterfully shown Hollywood how cinema can portray realistic sex without any loss of romanticism or intimacy.

Barry Jenkins’ Oscar-winner is one of the most tender depictions of yearning in modern cinema. Its protagonist Chiron (played by Ashton Sanders here, at other points by Alex R. Hibbert and Trevante Rhodes) experiences his first sexual encounter with fellow student Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) on a quiet, isolated beach. Their fumbling may pay testament to the awkwardness of a teenager’s first experiences, but Jenkins’ approach also gives the moment a profound grace, and an acknowledgement of how it will come to shape Chiron’s own view of himself. Much like Blue Valentine, Nicolas Roeg’s 1973 classic swiftly faced controversy due to a sex scene so emotionally faithful (while also depicting a female character, Julie Christie’s Laura, receiving oral sex), that it caused clashes with censors. A grieving couple desperately holding onto the shreds of their marriage after the death of their child, Laura and John (Donald Sutherland)’s raw emotions and vulnerability in this moment are famously intercut with post-coital preparations to go to dinner - an attempt, in fact, to satiate censors. Sex is funny, sometimes hilarious. There’s no getting through this list without acknowledging that fact, and there’s no better film to summarise it than Team America: World Police and its infamous puppet intercourse, enthusiastically filing through every sexual position in the book.Trust David Lynch to create a highly-charged sex scene that inevitably only becomes part of the web created to deceive and befuddle us. Rita (Laura Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts) may consummate their bubbling affections for each other in a sensuous, dreamlike manner - but who is Rita in this moment? Who is Betty? Is this encounter real or imagined?One of the finest examples of the erotic thriller, director Adrian Lyne depicts the extramarital affair in its full urgency, its entire spectrum of conflicted emotions, as suburban housewife Connie (Diane Lane) becomes enraptured by a handsome young Frenchman (Olivier Martinez). McDonald is currently starring alongside Michael Shannon in a revival of Terrence McNally’s Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, which features both actors in scenes featuring full-frontal nudity and simulated sex.Michael Shannon watched the Oscars on mute in a Chicago barMichael Shannon: ‘If you’re voting for Trump, it’s time for the urn’Jo Sullivan Loesser: Broadway star who left a musical legacy They did not, however, confirm whether the audience member was identified, or if the photographs of McDonald were erased.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under the proposals, employers would be obliged to take steps to cool workplaces down once the temperature hits 24C.Currently there’s no law for minimum or maximum working temperatures but employers must ensure temperatures are “reasonable” while separate guidelines recommend 16C as a minimum.The Met Office predicts temperatures will rise to 37C\u0026nbspin parts of the UK on Thursday, higher than the July record of 36.7C.The all-time UK record of 38.5C, set in Faversham in August 2003, is also “under threat”.However the soaring temperatures – caused by the jet stream pushing hot air up from southern Europe – will pose a health risk to vulnerable groups, such as older people and infants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Affected Apple devices are not impacted until November 3 2019.If you don\u0027t update to the newest version of iOS available for your device before November 3 2019, some models might not be able to maintain an accurate GPS position. And functions that rely on the correct date and time - such as syncing with iCloud and fetching email - might not work.The updated software version number should be 10.3.4 or 9.3.6, depending on your device.The technology giant added that the issue doesn\u0027t affect iOS devices newer than those listed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To keep him involved, the crew had to head to where the actor was filming his other, bigger projects (hence the season begins with a double episode in London, where he was filming s of the Galaxy). That season also saw Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones leave the show, leading to some patches that were never really covered over. Still, the final episode was still a delight, with Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope meeting Michelle Obama and getting her dream job in Pawnee. But then they made a seventh, completely unnecessary season a few years later… which we should all forget exists.The show that birthed the phrase “jumping the shark”. Season five of Happy Days saw Fonzie literally jumping over a shark – a moment so absurd that critics were left asking whether the writers had run out of material. The moment became the turning point for Happy Days as the quality gradually began to decline, the inclination of which got steeper after Ron Howard left after season seven.Thanks to stellar reviews and enticing advertising, Heroes quickly became one of the most-popular shows on television in 2006. However, while the charming first season – which centred on a group of people coming to terms with their super-human powers – was a fast-paced addictive ride, the second was a meandering mess. The first few episodes contained so much filler that viewers turned off in their droves. Season three fared no better, and by the conclusion of season four only 4.41 million people were still watching – down from the 16.97 million who watched the season two premiere.There was once a time when every winner on The X Factor was pretty much guaranteed a Christmas number one. It became such a monotonous routine in the UK that music lovers protested by getting Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name Of” to the coveted top spot in 2009. Coincidentally, the following years have seen the X Factor’s ratings begin to dwindle, mainly thanks to viewers becoming bored of the same sob stories being wheeled out every year. To fix this, Simon Cowell attempted to switch up the judges at an increased rate, scraping the barrel in 2015 by bringing on Nick Grimshaw (the same year that Dermot O’Leary stepped down as presenter, to be replaced by television’s most awkward duo, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs). Despite Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne (and Dermot) coming back the year after, the damage had already been done.Stars often outgrow their shows. Midway through the fourth season of Community, Donald Glover, who played Troy, left to pursue a music career as the rapper Childish Gambino. Of course, that did not turn out too badly, with Glover now having a few Grammys on his mantelpiece. Unfortunately, Community was never the same without him, and the dominoes kept falling after that. Chevy Chase also left, while Dan Harmon stopped writing for the show. As a result, the final two seasons received awful reviews.Big Brother was a big deal. The first few seasons spawned celebrities and managed to attract millions of viewers. While originally a strange social experiment put on by Channel 4, the show devolved into a middling reality TV series where contestants would do anything to prolong their 15 minutes of fame. When the show moved to Channel 5, it was only another knock on the death knell.The team behind Dallas were so desperate to bring back Patrick Duffy\u0027s character Bobby Ewing that they made the entire ninth season one long dream sequence. Of course, they had initially not known the entire season would be a dream, as Duffy had voluntarily left to pursue other acting jobs. Obviously, things did not go well for the actor, and the writing team put him back into the show – at the expense of viewers, who felt understandably short-changed by the events of 31 episodes being reversed. Note for TV writers: “It was all a dream” is not a good TV trope.830 House of CardsBefore Kevin Spacey was kicked off the cast following more than 40 allegations of sexual assault, House of Cards was feeling stuck in the mud. The Underwoods’ journey to power had been fascinating their struggle to keep power, not so much. When Spacey was rightly dropped, the writers were forced to press on, with little time to rewrite the script as two episodes had already been filmed and needed completely redoing. Despite their best intentions, the final season was a mess – although the show’s legacy had already been tarnished by Spacey.Gogglebox’s premise is preposterously simple – film normal people watching television and capture their conversations. For such a basic recipe to work, all the ingredients need to be perfect, and, for a time, they were. Stephanie and Dominic Parker were the highlights for the first few seasons, and then the Moffatt family, with the quotable Scarlett, joined in the third series. However, fame soon caught up with both families, and they left the show one after the other. Their replacements have never been quite as good.The quality of Top Gear had long dwindled before Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans took over from Jeremy Clarkson and co. It wasn’t until the trio finally left, though, that fans realised just how awful Top Gear could potentially be. LeBlanc and Evans had no chemistry, the pair awkwardly jostling with each other for screen-time. By the time their first series together had ended, Evans had received so much flack he decided to leave. Top Gear has not yet recovered – although everyone’s fingers are crossed in the hope that Chris Harris, Sabine Schmitz, Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff can return the show to its former glory.Sherlock made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name and had three stellar seasons before turning downhill. What great television those seasons were, with the modern take on the classic detective story proving a thrilling watch. Come the Christmas special and the writers had become too enthralled by their own mythos what was sold as a special episode, set in Victorian England, was actually modern-day Sherlock using drugs to e into his own subconscious. The episode was a mess – as was the following fourth season.Initially an addictive period drama, Downton Abbey slowly became more and more soapy. The point of no return came during the Christmas day episode “A Journey to the Highlands”, when – just moments after the birth of his child – Matthew Crawley was run over by a milk truck. Some fans were reportedly so outraged that they Tweeted how their Christmases were ruined.That 70s Show arguably had multiple “jump the shark” moments throughout its run. One such moment was when the writers introduced Brooke, who fell pregnant after a one-night stand with Ashton Kutcher’s Michael Kelso. The setup was merely a ploy to enable Kutcher to leave the show at the end of the season. Then there was the surprising revelation that Danny Masterson’s Steven Hyde had two fathers. But perhaps the moment that best signals the show’s downward spiral is when they decided to switch the actor who played Laurie Forman. After Lisa Robin Kelly had played Forman for five seasons, the showrunners unexpectedly – and without explanation – brought in Christina Moore to take over the character.1430 Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy has legions of fans, and for good reason. The first few seasons mesh funny quips and lovelorn lust to perfection, while it’s all strung together by a high-school story about a vampire-killing badass. Things started to waver slightly at the beginning of season six, when the series resolved their “is Buffy dead?” cliffhanger with the Scoobie gang resurrecting her. From there, the characters became shadows of their former selves, the story going to much darker places than before, including one controversial storyline about attempted rape. The show was never the same againStruggling to keep viewers watching, the writers of The Brady Bunch decided something needed to change. Rather than work with already-established characters, they decided to introduce a new child: Cousin Oliver, played by Robbie Rist, who was the show’s youngest actor (nine-years-old) at the time. This decision may have been intended to make The Brady Bunch “adorable” again, but viewers turned away at the obvious attempt to shoehorn something new into the show. The show was cancelled five episodes later and it sparked the phrase “Cousin Oliver Syndrome” – a trope where a show introduces a child character to boost ratings but fails. (Some fans believe the late introduction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s sister Dawn is an example of this.)1630 Two and a Half MenTwo and a Half Men was, for a long time, one of the most-watched TV series in the United States. Why exactly? Well, that would likely be down to Charlie Sheen, whose obnoxious, heightened version of himself (his character’s also named Charlie) charmed the nation. Sheen’s private life, though, soon outdid his fictional counterpart, with the actor going into rehab and making headlines with his bizarre rants (winning!). The network took notice and replaced Sheen with Ashton Kutcher, whose naïve-shtick never quite worked.The first seasons of Battlestar Galactica (the updated series) were phenomenal television, but that did not stop the science fiction show having some slightly questionable moments. Perhaps the most famous came towards the season three finale, when the five remaining Cylons (human replicas) are outed. They are discovered (or discover themselves) when the Final Five – Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders – all come together after hearing a version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”. It’s cumbersome, silly, and the tipping point for the once great show.The famous British poet John Cooper Clarke has argued many times that The Simpsons was one of best shows on television. “There is no better spokesperson for the modern proletarian male than Homer J Simpson,” he once said. Clarke was likely referring to only the first dozen or so seasons of The Simpsons as, since then, the animated show about the eponymous blue-collar family has suffered in its attempts to remain quite as relevant and funny. Season 30, as a result, contains the least-watched episode of The Simpsons ever: less than two million tuned in to the episode “I\u0027m Dancing as Fat as I Can”, guest starring Netflix boss Ted Sarandos.Despite stellar reviews and an adoring (if somewhat small) fanbase, Arrested Development was cancelled after its third season. Arrested Development should probably have stayed cancelled. Netflix brought back the acclaimed series for a fourth season in 2013, changing the format so each episode centred on a different character. Critics called the new approach awkward, saying it missed the character interactions that made the show so great. The showrunners seemingly agreed as they later released a remixed version of season four that followed the classic formula. That release came just before season five which has, to put it lightly, been decimated by critics. As Michael Bluth would say: “I don’t know what I expected.”Anthology series are hard to get right. On the one hand, each season can be completely different, allowing for creativity to flourish. On the other, writers need to somehow make sure that each season still feels like the same show, otherwise they risk alienating fans.Unlike the UK Office, the American counterpart went on too long. Steve Carell as Michael Scott was the heart of the show, and his departure in season seven was a massive hit for the series. Even comedy heavyweight Will Ferrell couldn’t fill the void left by Carell. And while the show was certainly never awful, the final episodes could not compete with the glorious highs of previous seasons.After eight seasons, Smallville was already losing fans, many of whom were desperately waiting for Superman to finally wear the suit (they would have to wait for the final episode). Romances were already growing too prolonged and then the superhero’s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, decided to leave. With his contract complete, actor Michael Rosenbaum decided to jump ship, and the show never found a villain that could match him.Where does Prison Break go when the inmates break out of prison? That was a question many were left asking following the season one finale, which saw the main gang escape Fox River State Penitentiary. There was still some gas left in the engine for season two as they went on the run, but the decision to send them back to prison for season three saw the story retreading already well-worn ground.The X-Files masterfully kept viewers enthralled by its science fiction mysteries for eight seasons. Mulder and Scully were key to that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson’s chemistry electrified the show while keeping everything grounded. Unfortunately, due to contract arrangements, Mulder was written out during the season eight finale. That left the show in the hands of two other agents, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), who were short-changed with an incoherent storyline. As a result, the show was cancelled in 2002 – only to be brought back, with Duchovny and Anderson on board, in 2016.Although one of the most influential comedies of all time, Seinfeld was not without its faults. Season nine, the final one, marks a blemish on the iconic show’s history. Larry David, the highlight of season six through eight, was relegated to guest and only wrote the season finale. The other writers, meanwhile, were struggling to come up with new ideas – something that ironically proved the downfall for the show famously about nothing.Glee was a phenomenon. For a few years, Gleeks – fans of the show – were everywhere. That is until season three. The whimsy soon wore off as fans believed the show had become too overtly cheesy. Still, the Gleeks kept on singing, and the show continued for another three seasons.The late Noughties were a wonderful time for anti-heroes on television. Following in the footsteps of Tony Soprano were Mad Men’s Don Draper, Breaking Bad’s Walter White, and Dexter’s Dexter Morgan. While Don and Walter have become unquestioned pop-culture icons thanks to their series being of such phenomenal quality, Dexter’s legacy has become mired by two dire seasons and an unsatisfying conclusion. Season six was the first time the fictional serial killer dropped the baton. And while Dexter recovered for season seven, the following final few episodes were so unanimously panned that even the leading actor, Michael C Hall, reportedly thought they were awful.While Greg Wallace and Antony Worrall Thompson may have been the first two hosts of Saturday Kitchen, it was James Martin who really made the show a success. Under his steady guidance, viewership increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million and the cookery programme became a staple weekend watch. No replacement host has been brought on board since Martin left in 2016, and the show has suffered as a result. At least the Keith Floyd and Rick Stein repeats are as good as ever. What started as a critically adored Buff the Vampire Slayer spin-off soon became a run-of-the-mill drama. Angel started with its focus on the eponymous vampire-with-a-heart working as a private detective and saving humans from other demons. However, after Angel came to terms with his ongoing struggle between his human side and his vampire side, the show became a little stale. Season three was filled with filler episodes and shallow villains. Then came season four a narrative mess that struggled to reconcile the characters Cordelia and Connor. Even with the stellar episode Spin the Bottle in the mix, many fans were unimpressed by the direction the show had gone in.David Lynch’s dreamy murder mystery has become a cult classic, and for good reason. The first season was wonderfully strange and melodramatic. Then the network began putting pressure on Lynch to reveal to the world who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch had not wanted to reveal the murderer but was forced to. The show lacked the same drive after the discovery. Considering the showrunner himself has said the second season “sucked” it’s no stretch to say that it jumped the shark.130 Parks and RecreationParks and Recreation’s sixth season was filmed while Chris Pratt was on the cusp of becoming a global megastar. To keep him involved, the crew had to head to where the actor was filming his other, bigger projects (hence the season begins with a double episode in London, where he was filming s of the Galaxy). That season also saw Rob Lowe and Rashida Jones leave the show, leading to some patches that were never really covered over. Still, the final episode was still a delight, with Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope meeting Michelle Obama and getting her dream job in Pawnee.

The moment became the turning point for Happy Days as the quality gradually began to decline, the inclination of which got steeper after Ron Howard left after season seven.Thanks to stellar reviews and enticing advertising, Heroes quickly became one of the most-popular shows on television in 2006. However, while the charming first season – which centred on a group of people coming to terms with their super-human powers – was a fast-paced addictive ride, the second was a meandering mess. The first few episodes contained so much filler that viewers turned off in their droves. Season three fared no better, and by the conclusion of season four only 4.41 million people were still watching – down from the 16.97 million who watched the season two premiere.There was once a time when every winner on The X Factor was pretty much guaranteed a Christmas number one. It became such a monotonous routine in the UK that music lovers protested by getting Rage Against the Machine’s “Killing in the Name Of” to the coveted top spot in 2009. Coincidentally, the following years have seen the X Factor’s ratings begin to dwindle, mainly thanks to viewers becoming bored of the same sob stories being wheeled out every year. To fix this, Simon Cowell attempted to switch up the judges at an increased rate, scraping the barrel in 2015 by bringing on Nick Grimshaw (the same year that Dermot O’Leary stepped down as presenter, to be replaced by television’s most awkward duo, Caroline Flack and Olly Murs). Despite Louis Walsh, Nicole Scherzinger and Sharon Osbourne (and Dermot) coming back the year after, the damage had already been done.Stars often outgrow their shows. Midway through the fourth season of Community, Donald Glover, who played Troy, left to pursue a music career as the rapper Childish Gambino. Of course, that did not turn out too badly, with Glover now having a few Grammys on his mantelpiece. Unfortunately, Community was never the same without him, and the dominoes kept falling after that. Chevy Chase also left, while Dan Harmon stopped writing for the show. As a result, the final two seasons received awful reviews.Big Brother was a big deal. The first few seasons spawned celebrities and managed to attract millions of viewers. While originally a strange social experiment put on by Channel 4, the show devolved into a middling reality TV series where contestants would do anything to prolong their 15 minutes of fame. When the show moved to Channel 5, it was only another knock on the death knell.The team behind Dallas were so desperate to bring back Patrick Duffy\u0027s character Bobby Ewing that they made the entire ninth season one long dream sequence. Of course, they had initially not known the entire season would be a dream, as Duffy had voluntarily left to pursue other acting jobs. Obviously, things did not go well for the actor, and the writing team put him back into the show – at the expense of viewers, who felt understandably short-changed by the events of 31 episodes being reversed. Note for TV writers: “It was all a dream” is not a good TV trope.830 House of CardsBefore Kevin Spacey was kicked off the cast following more than 40 allegations of sexual assault, House of Cards was feeling stuck in the mud. The Underwoods’ journey to power had been fascinating their struggle to keep power, not so much. When Spacey was rightly dropped, the writers were forced to press on, with little time to rewrite the script as two episodes had already been filmed and needed completely redoing. Despite their best intentions, the final season was a mess – although the show’s legacy had already been tarnished by Spacey.Gogglebox’s premise is preposterously simple – film normal people watching television and capture their conversations. For such a basic recipe to work, all the ingredients need to be perfect, and, for a time, they were. Stephanie and Dominic Parker were the highlights for the first few seasons, and then the Moffatt family, with the quotable Scarlett, joined in the third series. However, fame soon caught up with both families, and they left the show one after the other. Their replacements have never been quite as good.The quality of Top Gear had long dwindled before Matt LeBlanc and Chris Evans took over from Jeremy Clarkson and co. It wasn’t until the trio finally left, though, that fans realised just how awful Top Gear could potentially be. LeBlanc and Evans had no chemistry, the pair awkwardly jostling with each other for screen-time. By the time their first series together had ended, Evans had received so much flack he decided to leave. Top Gear has not yet recovered – although everyone’s fingers are crossed in the hope that Chris Harris, Sabine Schmitz, Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff can return the show to its former glory.Sherlock made Benedict Cumberbatch a household name and had three stellar seasons before turning downhill. What great television those seasons were, with the modern take on the classic detective story proving a thrilling watch. Come the Christmas special and the writers had become too enthralled by their own mythos what was sold as a special episode, set in Victorian England, was actually modern-day Sherlock using drugs to e into his own subconscious. The episode was a mess – as was the following fourth season.Initially an addictive period drama, Downton Abbey slowly became more and more soapy. The point of no return came during the Christmas day episode “A Journey to the Highlands”, when – just moments after the birth of his child – Matthew Crawley was run over by a milk truck. Some fans were reportedly so outraged that they Tweeted how their Christmases were ruined.That 70s Show arguably had multiple “jump the shark” moments throughout its run. One such moment was when the writers introduced Brooke, who fell pregnant after a one-night stand with Ashton Kutcher’s Michael Kelso. The setup was merely a ploy to enable Kutcher to leave the show at the end of the season. Then there was the surprising revelation that Danny Masterson’s Steven Hyde had two fathers. But perhaps the moment that best signals the show’s downward spiral is when they decided to switch the actor who played Laurie Forman. After Lisa Robin Kelly had played Forman for five seasons, the showrunners unexpectedly – and without explanation – brought in Christina Moore to take over the character.1430 Buffy the Vampire SlayerBuffy has legions of fans, and for good reason. The first few seasons mesh funny quips and lovelorn lust to perfection, while it’s all strung together by a high-school story about a vampire-killing badass. Things started to waver slightly at the beginning of season six, when the series resolved their “is Buffy dead?” cliffhanger with the Scoobie gang resurrecting her. From there, the characters became shadows of their former selves, the story going to much darker places than before, including one controversial storyline about attempted rape. The show was never the same againStruggling to keep viewers watching, the writers of The Brady Bunch decided something needed to change. Rather than work with already-established characters, they decided to introduce a new child: Cousin Oliver, played by Robbie Rist, who was the show’s youngest actor (nine-years-old) at the time. This decision may have been intended to make The Brady Bunch “adorable” again, but viewers turned away at the obvious attempt to shoehorn something new into the show. The show was cancelled five episodes later and it sparked the phrase “Cousin Oliver Syndrome” – a trope where a show introduces a child character to boost ratings but fails. (Some fans believe the late introduction of Buffy the Vampire Slayer’s sister Dawn is an example of this.)1630 Two and a Half MenTwo and a Half Men was, for a long time, one of the most-watched TV series in the United States. Why exactly? Well, that would likely be down to Charlie Sheen, whose obnoxious, heightened version of himself (his character’s also named Charlie) charmed the nation. Sheen’s private life, though, soon outdid his fictional counterpart, with the actor going into rehab and making headlines with his bizarre rants (winning!). The network took notice and replaced Sheen with Ashton Kutcher, whose naïve-shtick never quite worked.The first seasons of Battlestar Galactica (the updated series) were phenomenal television, but that did not stop the science fiction show having some slightly questionable moments. Perhaps the most famous came towards the season three finale, when the five remaining Cylons (human replicas) are outed. They are discovered (or discover themselves) when the Final Five – Tory, Colonel Tigh, Tyrol, and Anders – all come together after hearing a version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower”. It’s cumbersome, silly, and the tipping point for the once great show.The famous British poet John Cooper Clarke has argued many times that The Simpsons was one of best shows on television. “There is no better spokesperson for the modern proletarian male than Homer J Simpson,” he once said. Clarke was likely referring to only the first dozen or so seasons of The Simpsons as, since then, the animated show about the eponymous blue-collar family has suffered in its attempts to remain quite as relevant and funny. Season 30, as a result, contains the least-watched episode of The Simpsons ever: less than two million tuned in to the episode “I\u0027m Dancing as Fat as I Can”, guest starring Netflix boss Ted Sarandos.Despite stellar reviews and an adoring (if somewhat small) fanbase, Arrested Development was cancelled after its third season. Arrested Development should probably have stayed cancelled. Netflix brought back the acclaimed series for a fourth season in 2013, changing the format so each episode centred on a different character. Critics called the new approach awkward, saying it missed the character interactions that made the show so great. The showrunners seemingly agreed as they later released a remixed version of season four that followed the classic formula. That release came just before season five which has, to put it lightly, been decimated by critics. As Michael Bluth would say: “I don’t know what I expected.”Anthology series are hard to get right. On the one hand, each season can be completely different, allowing for creativity to flourish. On the other, writers need to somehow make sure that each season still feels like the same show, otherwise they risk alienating fans.Unlike the UK Office, the American counterpart went on too long. Steve Carell as Michael Scott was the heart of the show, and his departure in season seven was a massive hit for the series. Even comedy heavyweight Will Ferrell couldn’t fill the void left by Carell. And while the show was certainly never awful, the final episodes could not compete with the glorious highs of previous seasons.After eight seasons, Smallville was already losing fans, many of whom were desperately waiting for Superman to finally wear the suit (they would have to wait for the final episode). Romances were already growing too prolonged and then the superhero’s arch-nemesis, Lex Luthor, decided to leave. With his contract complete, actor Michael Rosenbaum decided to jump ship, and the show never found a villain that could match him.Where does Prison Break go when the inmates break out of prison? That was a question many were left asking following the season one finale, which saw the main gang escape Fox River State Penitentiary. There was still some gas left in the engine for season two as they went on the run, but the decision to send them back to prison for season three saw the story retreading already well-worn ground.The X-Files masterfully kept viewers enthralled by its science fiction mysteries for eight seasons. Mulder and Scully were key to that David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson’s chemistry electrified the show while keeping everything grounded. Unfortunately, due to contract arrangements, Mulder was written out during the season eight finale. That left the show in the hands of two other agents, John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), who were short-changed with an incoherent storyline. As a result, the show was cancelled in 2002 – only to be brought back, with Duchovny and Anderson on board, in 2016.Although one of the most influential comedies of all time, Seinfeld was not without its faults. Season nine, the final one, marks a blemish on the iconic show’s history. Larry David, the highlight of season six through eight, was relegated to guest and only wrote the season finale. The other writers, meanwhile, were struggling to come up with new ideas – something that ironically proved the downfall for the show famously about nothing.Glee was a phenomenon. For a few years, Gleeks – fans of the show – were everywhere. That is until season three. The whimsy soon wore off as fans believed the show had become too overtly cheesy. Still, the Gleeks kept on singing, and the show continued for another three seasons.The late Noughties were a wonderful time for anti-heroes on television. Following in the footsteps of Tony Soprano were Mad Men’s Don Draper, Breaking Bad’s Walter White, and Dexter’s Dexter Morgan. While Don and Walter have become unquestioned pop-culture icons thanks to their series being of such phenomenal quality, Dexter’s legacy has become mired by two dire seasons and an unsatisfying conclusion. Season six was the first time the fictional serial killer dropped the baton. And while Dexter recovered for season seven, the following final few episodes were so unanimously panned that even the leading actor, Michael C Hall, reportedly thought they were awful.While Greg Wallace and Antony Worrall Thompson may have been the first two hosts of Saturday Kitchen, it was James Martin who really made the show a success. Under his steady guidance, viewership increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million and the cookery programme became a staple weekend watch. No replacement host has been brought on board since Martin left in 2016, and the show has suffered as a result. At least the Keith Floyd and Rick Stein repeats are as good as ever. What started as a critically adored Buff the Vampire Slayer spin-off soon became a run-of-the-mill drama. Angel started with its focus on the eponymous vampire-with-a-heart working as a private detective and saving humans from other demons. However, after Angel came to terms with his ongoing struggle between his human side and his vampire side, the show became a little stale. Season three was filled with filler episodes and shallow villains. Then came season four a narrative mess that struggled to reconcile the characters Cordelia and Connor. Even with the stellar episode Spin the Bottle in the mix, many fans were unimpressed by the direction the show had gone in.David Lynch’s dreamy murder mystery has become a cult classic, and for good reason. The first season was wonderfully strange and melodramatic. Then the network began putting pressure on Lynch to reveal to the world who killed Laura Palmer. Lynch had not wanted to reveal the murderer but was forced to. The show lacked the same drive after the discovery. Considering the showrunner himself has said the second season “sucked” it’s no stretch to say that it jumped the shark.“I’ve never seen an actor be so protective about their character,” Jagannathan said. “If you’re on set and the director and the producer and the writer say something, you will step out of character, take the notes, and then go back in. That’s just what I’ve seen.“And Meryl was – it wasn’t that she wouldn’t entertain any comments, she just wouldn’t entertain any comments that insinuated that she was the villain of the piece. Or any comments that asked her to up the ante on the villain-ness. She was just very protective of her character. She would literally say, ‘That’s none of your business, I don’t think.’ I literally did a double take.”Critics are shredding the ‘lacklustre’ Big Little Lies finaleHBO responds to reports of behind-the-scenes Big Little Lies dramaMeryl Streep chose to wear fake teeth for role in Big Little LiesJagannathan did, however, insist that Streep wasn’t malicious in her interaction with the show’s behind-the-scenes crew. “She’s not saying that out of being rude or anything,” she explained. “She just has to protect the integrity and the humanity of her character.”The second season of Big Little Lies, which earned mixed reviews for its finale last Sunday, had been blighted with controversy in recent weeks, after IndieWire revealed that Arnold, the British director behind films including Fish Tank and American Honey, had been locked out of the editing room and had her work cut to ribbons without her knowledge by director Jean-Marc Vallée, who directed the show’s first season.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Under the proposals, employers would be obliged to take steps to cool workplaces down once the temperature hits 24C.Currently there’s no law for minimum or maximum working temperatures but employers must ensure temperatures are “reasonable” while separate guidelines recommend 16C as a minimum.The Met Office predicts temperatures will rise to 37C\u0026nbspin parts of the UK on Thursday, higher than the July record of 36.7C.The all-time UK record of 38.5C, set in Faversham in August 2003, is also “under threat”.However the soaring temperatures – caused by the jet stream pushing hot air up from southern Europe – will pose a health risk to vulnerable groups, such as older people and infants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two bodies providing closely watched forecasts, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and the Office for Budget Responsibility, have in recent days warned of such a possibility. \u0026nbspThe CBI survey showed that manufacturing activity was expected to pick up over the next three months, with the output balance rising to +6 per cent.\u0026nbspHowever, investment plans for the next 12 months weakened. Uncertainty about future demand was the most-cited reason but labour shortages were also a concern.“With orders, employment, investment, output and business optimism all deteriorating among manufacturers, it’s crucial for the new prime minister to secure a Brexit deal ahead of the October deadline – and get on with pressing domestic priorities from improving our infrastructure to fixing the apprenticeship levy,” Ms Newton-Smith said. \u0026nbsp“This will allow firms to focus on investing in new technology and tackling the skill shortages that plague this sector.”The CBI interviewed 291 firms between 25 June and 15 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

the share of nuclear power in the country’s electricity production has remained virtually unchanged.Black coal use fell by 30 per cent compared to the first half of 2018, and lignite\u0026nbsp– a coal-like substance formed from peat – fell by 20 per cent.However, over the same period, electricity production by natural gas rose by 10 per cent.Professor Bruno Burger, of the Fraunhofer\u0026nbspISE, said the\u0026nbspdrop in coal use was the result of a market-driven “fuel switch” from coal to gas.He attributed the switch to low gas prices combined with a rise in the cost of carbon dioxide allowances in the EU Emissions Trading System.We really see an interesting phenomenon: in the daily German power market, a high carbon price and very low gas price is really pushing gas in front of lignite.”Renewables \u0027to replace fossil fuels as UK\u0027s main power source\u0027 by 2030Renewables accounted for 40 per cent of Germany’s electricity consumption in 2018, according to government figures.While in the UK, 29 per cent of electricity\u0026nbspwas sourced from renewables\u0026nbsplast year.Germany is aiming to phase out its nuclear power plants by 2022. Its renewable energy has been rising steadily over the last two decades thanks in part to the Renewable Energy Act (EEG), which was reformed last year to cut costs for consumers.But Germany still relies heavily on coal, gas and lignite for its energy needs.Germany’s reluctance to end its dependence on coal saw hundreds of climate activists storm one of the country’s biggest open-pit coal mines in June to protest\u0026nbspagainst fossil fuel use.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are our waters and we will protect them.”He repeated Tehran’s claim that the British had committed “piracy” over the seizure of the Grace 1 supertanker by the authorities in Gibraltar two weeks ago on suspicion that it was transporting oil to Syria in breach of European Union sanctions. That seems to have led to the retaliation against the\u0026nbspStena\u0026nbspImpero.Mr Zarif accused the UK of carrying out the policies of the US hawks led by John Bolton which Tehran has dubbed the B-team.Jeremy Hunt announces joint European task force to protect UK shipsPompeo says ‘responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’Iran sentences ‘CIA spies’ to death Iran heard threatening tanker in newly released radio exchangeHe said: “We are responsible for security and freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf.“That is our lifeline and it is much, much better for the United Kingdom not to be engaged in implementing the ploys of the B-team.“The B-team is losing ground in the United States and now they are turning their attention to the United Kingdom.“I guess the same policies that failed in the US will fail in the United Kingdom.”Pompeo on Iran seizing British oil tanker: ‘Responsibility falls to UK to take care of its ships’Mr Hunt\u0026nbsptold MPs on Monday that the proposed new European mission would focus on ensuring free navigation through one of the world’s most important waterways, which carries a fifth of the world’s oil and a quarter of its liquefied natural gas flow.It would seek to “complement” US proposals to protect shipping in the region, although it would not form part of the American “maximum pressure” policy on Tehran as the UK continued to support the Iran nuclear deal which the US has repudiated.“It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing this increased international presence in the Gulf, because the focus of our diplomacy has been on de-escalating tensions in the hope that such changes would not be necessary,” Mr Hunt said.He added: “If Iran continues on this dangerous path, they must accept the price will be a larger western military presence in the waters along their coastline, not because we wish to increase tensions but simply because freedom of navigation is a principle which Britain and its allies will always defend.”Meanwhile, the head of the US Central Command said a US Navy ship might have brought down a second Iranian drone in the Strait last week.On Thursday, the US said a Navy ship had “destroyed” an Iranian drone after the aircraft threatened the vessel, but Iran said it had no information about losing a drone.“We are confident we brought down one drone, we may have brought down a second,” General Kenneth McKenzie told CBS News in an interview.Additional reporting by agenciesStraight of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

andBoris is likely to call a snap one.A General Election is the chance for people in the UK to select an MP to represent their local area in the House of Commons.Normally there will be several candidates, each from a dferent political party, standing to be the Member of Parliament in each constituency.The vote will also determine who will be elected as the UK Prime Minister.The last General Election was held on June , .Despite it widely being parroted that a general election this year is inevitable, Boris Johnson has said he is against the idea of a snap election.However,enough MPs are against Boris no-deal Brexit then they could trigger a vote of no confidence andnothing is resolved, after  days a snap general election would be triggered.If Boris did change his mind and decide to trigger a general election then he would need the support of  per cent of MPs - just . per cent short of the amount who voted him in.His support for a no-deal Brexit has sent at least five MPs so far running - Boris may want to trigger a general election before Brexits  day time limit is up in order to secure a bigger parliamentary majority and thus more backing throughout EU negotiations.Johnsons staunch leave stance -

In a white van, they can pop home whenever they need to.One secondary school teacher, who’s female actually, lived at home with her parents with three toilets. When she got her own flat, she was OK except occasionally she got blocked when she heard footsteps upstairs, and that would stop her.The crunch point was when her fiance stayed over with her, she couldn’t have a wee in the night when he was asleep. She jumped in the car, drove  minutes to her parents’ house, and used the downstairs cloakroom and then drove back hope. This is all hidden. They’ll go to any s to hide the problem they’ve got because they’re too ashamed and too embarrassed to ask for help.Andrew said his own experience with the condition can be traced back to when he was just three-and-a-half years old.He said: I was in a gents public toilet, one of the pee up against the wall trough types, with my father.I remember just being very uneasy and anxious in that situation.That early age anxiety rooted itself in Andrews mind, following him through school to the point where he had to wait until he thought the toilets were empty whenever he needed to use one.And when he went off to Cambridge University, his particular anxiety was having serious negative effects.He said: I never went to the pub because I couldn’t consider the idea of downing pints of liquid and getting trapped.So that affects social le.Andrew says the worry is constant, even when youre not in the toilets.He explains: It’s always in the back of your mind like a little subroutine, just ticking off ‘where am I going to be in two hours’ time, where am I going to be this evening, what’s happening at the weekend,’ just checking I’ll be able to manage.It wasnt until mid-le that Andrew developed strategies to cope with his condition, including arriving late to pub meetups or leaving early.He also stuck to drinking shorts instead of pints, which really marks you out as an oddball.Eventually, he managed to get the problem under control to the point where, instead of being incapacitated by paruresis, he ended up merely on the shy end of normal.Andrew added: Sometimes I use the urinals depending on the situation, other times I can’t, but I don’t give a toss about using a cubicle - I just do whatever’s comfortable for me, and that’s OK.Andrew now helps sufferers by using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy-led workshops which gets patients to challenge anxious beliefs they hold about going to the toilet.In most cases, people with paruresis become worried people are noticing theyre not peeing, either by watching them or listening to them, which itself makes the fear worse.Andrew explains: They’re highly self-conscious about being in a cubicle, because in their mind a cubicle is there only for a number two, you shouldn’t be in thereyou’re doing a number one, so they’re very self-conscious about their feet pointing the wrong way and that sort of thing.Broadly speaking, the severity of the condition can be ided into three groups.Andrew says there are: Those who can usually manage a cubicle, but can’t manage the urinal there’s those who can usually manage in a domestic situation but can’t manage a cubicle and then the severe cases are the ones who struggle in a domestic situation.Hard data on just how many people suffer from paruresis is dficult to estimate.But according to the International Paruresis Association in America, around seven per cent of the population has it.In the States, that represents a staggering million people.If the same proportion is true in the UK, that would be a whopping .million people.And Andrew says the problem ends up surfacing among groups of men where you might not expect it.He said: The American association managed to get hold of a guy who’d worked in the armed forces and was responsible for drug testing and they asked him his experience of the reaction of people.Because in America the method of drug testing is Draconian — you actually have to pee into a bottle in front of somebody so they can see the pee leaving your body to go into it.He thought about three out of ten guys had absolutely no problem doing that.But five out of ten struggled to a greater or lesser degree.They gave all sorts of weird excuses why they weren’t peeing like ‘It’s because you’re a noncommissioned officer, it’s putting me off’.Two out of ten couldn’t do it, so sat on the bench.So that’s an example where you start raising the bar beyond the point where the normal male population is used to and they suddenly find ‘Oh! It’s not working! What the f***’s going on One common mistaken belief about the condition is that it only affects blokes at the urinals.When actually, paruresis affects women too.Andrew said: Women are just as secretive and ashamed of this, but are less forced to seek help because it’s acceptable to be in a cubicle, whereas a lot of men feel it isn’t.The dferent pressure here, instead of being worried that youre being watched by other people in the bathroom, is that youre taking too long.Andrew explains: What really screws [women] up is time pressure.Women’s toilets are always in an inadequate number, so there’s always queues.So to go to the toilet when there’s a queue of people all waiting to go and wondering why you’re taking so long, that absolutely knackers them.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A new two-part TV series, Benidorm: Brits on the Pull, reveals Grace is just one of one of many pensioners who live and holiday in the infamous holiday resort -  and who have no intention of growing old gracefully.Here, we meet the OAPs whove switched sipping tea for downing shots.Good-time granny Grace, who has been coming to Benidorm for  years, says: “I love it here. My husband and I used to come out for about three or four months a year.”After her husband’s death, Grace moved to Benidorm full-time, living there for  years and only moving back to Britain two years ago.“I left Benidorm because of my age - I thought it would be a lot of bother for my family to get my body homeI dropped dead!”But she makes regular six-week visits back to the Mediterranean resort in Alicante - and keeps a diary of her raucous adventures - which include flashing her boobs in the street and pole-dancing on lampposts.“It draws me back all the time.

Mr Cummings is an abrasive former special advisor to Michael Gove who took on the blob of the teaching profession.He was then one of the architects of the official Vote Leave campaign, serving as its campaign director, during the EU referendum in . His famously bullish style was portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama on the infighting that plagued the Leave camp. He is said to have been a mastermind behind Vote Leaveaposs most controversial messages, including the bus that ly claimed we send £million a week to the EU and messages misleadingly claiming Turkey was joining the EU.

She replied: I am pleased to hand over to an incoming leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister who I worked with when he was in my Cabinet.But jeers erupted on the Labour benches - with MPs pointing out the blindingly obivous. Mr Johnson quit the Cabinet over her Brexit plan last year and spent  months undermining her government - eventually leading to her downfall.After regaining control of the Commons, she added shamelessly: ... And who is committed as a Conservative, who stood on a Conservative manesto in , to delivering on the vote of the British people in . The Prime Minister made the comments two hours before she visits the Queen to hand in her resignation - paving the way for Mr Johnson to take office this afternoon.    Boris Johnson stayed away to avoid being a distraction as she was flanked by doomed pro-EU allies - the deputy PM David Lidington and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who both face annihilation in a brutal Cabinet reshuffle. Mrs May was watched from the public gallery by her husband Philip May. But there was no easy ride for Mrs May as Labour MPs demanded she be held to account for a record of failed promises and U-turns. The Prime Minister said she will continue with her duties from the back benches, telling MPs: Following my duties in this House this afternoon I shall have an audience of Her Majesty the Queen. I shall then continue with my duties in this House from the back benches where I will continue to be the member of parliament for Maidenhead. But Mr Corbyn said there must be a general election called later on today as she tore up her own  manesto with U-turns on the dementia tax, fox hunting and free school meals.  Her successor has no mandate from the people, no mandate in which to move into office, he said. Mrs Mayaposs comment attempting to praise Mr Johnson came after a brutal question from Labour MP Ruth Cadbury. She asked how Mrs May felt handing over to a man who, among many things, is happy to demonise Muslims, is prepared to chuck our loyal public servants and diplomats under a bus, and promises to sell our country out to Donald Trump and his friends. Labour MP Kevin Brennan also twisted the kne, asking: Would she pardon her successor for sabotaging her premiership purely for his own personal ambition And Jeremy Corbyn prompted laughter by asking , as a backbench MP, she would help me oppose the reckless plans of her successor.Despite her praise Mrs May did have some coded criticism for Mr Johnson.

Stay-at-home mum-of-two Keeley, from Newmarket, Suffolk, spent just £ on her shoes, drove HERSELF to the registry office.

She and American husband Sebastian, a member of the US Air Force, insist their day was ‘absolutely perfect’. They have even now persuaded relatives to slash their wedding budgets too. Business owner Keeley, who was expecting at the time of the wedding, said: “We didn’t want anything big. I wanted a dress I’d feel comfortable in because I was six months pregnant. “I ordered a whole load of dresses and it turned out to be the cheapest one from ASOS that I liked the most.    “If you can afford it and it’s your big dream wedding then do it, but I don’t encourage anyone to start the first year of their marriage in debt. “When you spend the money and it’s all glitz and glamour, it isn’t for you, it’s for everyone . “Our wedding was small and personal and it was perfect. “Sebastian said we can renew our vows and have a big party but I’m not interested in that, I don’t see the point in spending lots of money.”    Sebastian wore his US Air Force unorm with a pre-owned suit while Keeley’s bridal shoes came from the Debenhams sale. Keeley’s aunt, Sharon, made the buttonholes as a gt and Keeley drove herself to the ceremony at the registry office in Bury St Edmunds. An £ ring and the cost of the ceremony made up the grand total of £. Hilariously, Sebastian chose for the couple to get married on a leap year – February  – so he would only have to buy an anniversary gt every four years. Keeley said: “I told Sebastian he could choose the date of the wedding so he cheaped out and made sure he only had to buy a gt every four years. “It’s ridiculous to spend £, just to spend more than your neighbours.

The record-breaking temperatures are making it impossible to sleep and most of us are spending hours lying in bed desperately trying to nod off. The internet is filled with tips and trips which claim to help, but according to one expert one of the most popular should be avoided at all costs - and it can actually make you hotter. Yep, thataposs right - that clever hack youaposve tried could actually make nodding off even more dficult. Great...   James Wilson, aka The Sleep Geek , claims that however hot you get you should never, ever put your pyjamas or bed sheets in the fridge or freezer.While many people say this can help as it cools you down, James says that while it might make you feel cooler for the first few minutes, the added moisture will quickly heat up and will make you hotter during the night.He told : When hot weather comes around there are some tips given out that may sound like they would work when actually they really really don’t. An example of this may be put your bedding pyjamas in the fridge or freezer or to wear wet socks to bed, but they both have the same problem.These approaches will add more moisture to your sleep environment and that moisture will heat up during the night.This means that although it may cool you down as you go to bed during the night this moisture will heat up and is likely to wake you as you come out of your sleep cycle. An alternative that works would be to have either a lukewarm bath or shower or put lukewarm water in a hot water bottle and rest the soles of your feet on it.    This helps raise your core temperature slightly which will then lead to a drop in core temperature. A drop in core temperature is an important part of the process to your body falling asleep and this approach is basically tricking your body into thinking it is cooler than it is. The reason we use lukewarm water rather than ice cold is that ice cold will shock your body, making it feel more active and more than likely prolonging the process of getting sleep. James tips for a good night sleep in the heat . Ensure there is a good airflow through the house. Open windows on both sides to allow the air to pass through . Close blinds and curtains in rooms that are exposed to direct sunlight. The shade will help the room stay cooler . Have a lukewarm bath or shower before bed to encourage your core temperature to drop, or alternatively put lukewarm water in a hot water bottle and place the soles of your feet on it  . If using a fan, place a bowl of chilled water in front of it to cool the stream of air itaposs pushing around the room .

Cotton is ok in hot weather, although it isn’t that great at wicking the moisture away I would suggest using bamboo.

Their relationship has certainly evolved over time and they have become closer since Meghanaposs wedding.

Meghan’s trait of raising both her cupped hands towards her face as she talks to Kate is a cute, quasi-infantile ritual that implies a desire to show you’re chatting to a best friend and sharing your message behind a partial cut-off.

Big sister Charly has been engaged to her IT worker partner Marcin Jerwan, , for five years. Ella was desperate to see the couple tie the knot – and joked that she should marry her boyfriend Chase Pretorius, , on the same day.The siblings, from Clackmannanshire, Scotland, decided to go ahead with the plan and said they “wouldn’t change it for the world”, reports the Daily Record .But although they bought their dresses on the same day, the sisters wore totally dferent styles – with Ella wearing Converse trainers matching her husband’s and a lace dress, while Charly wore heels with a strapless gown.  The idea started off as a joke, with younger sister Ella teasing her sibling about how long she had been engaged for. Ella said: “I had just recently got engaged and Charly had been engaged for five years. She hadn’t married yet and we started joking about getting married at the same time. “But then as we spoke more about it we said, ‘Why don’t we just do it ’” The two couples got married, one after the other, in the sun-soaked grounds of the Gartmore Village Hall on June , before sharing their reception inside. They cut their specially-made wedding cake together and even shared their first dance – dancing to the aptly named Better Together by Jack Johnson. Ella said: “We got prepared together upstairs and then our dad and step-dad walked us down the aisle. “I went first then Charly came downstairs. I did a speech for my sister and she did one for me.   “We also opted for a hand-tying ceremony for both of us and our husbands. We walked back into the village hall one after the other after the ceremony . It was stunning weather for us.It couldn’t have been better and we also got a little sunburnt.” Bank worker Ella said they kept a “family vibe” with about  guests made up of close family and friends. Ten guests attended from Chase’s homeland, South Africa, and Marcin had six guests from his native Poland. Ella said: “It was nice and not too busy. “All of the guests were there for the full day and we had a caterer come. “It’s Polish tradition that we provided all of the booze so everyone got a fair drink.” Despite the trickiness of coordinating two weddings on the same day, Ella said she “wouldn’t change it for the world” and would recommend it to others.

The club with the highest UEFA co-efficient that has qualied for the groups will receive £, x , or £.m.And that’s before TV and gate receipts are taken into account.However, to access that pot the Dons have to negotiate another three rounds and six games, with teams from the Champions League also dropping down in later stages.McInnes accepts money is tight, which is why he is grateful to the Dons board for their financial backing to build a squad he believes is capable of pushing for group stage qualication.He said: “The club are trying so hard to achieve everything and we see the importance of the training ground and the new stadium.“We are also trying to stay competitive on the pitch.“We work closely with the board and are well aware that money is tight at the minute.“We are well supported with the budget to try to put a squad together not only for these games but for the season.“During the summer we made a number of signicant signings.“Financially the group stages would be brilliant and another tick on what we can do here.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/07/5d37f4543bee66.89953647-126x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dons striker stevie may not on georgia flight as move to st johnstone edges closer","story":"Aberdeen striker Stevie May did not jet out with the squad to Tbilisi in Georgia as he is set to seal a move to St Johnstone.It is understood the -year-old is poised to head back to former club St Johnstone  after agreeing his departure from Aberdeen.Ross County, Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Championship sides Dundee United and Dundee were keen on securing May but St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright has engineered histo Perth.A £, signing from Preston North End in summer  May still has two years left on his Pittodrie deal.Aberdeen were keen to put the striker out on loan but it is understood May wanted a permanent move.The Dons were today set to touch down in Tbilisi and will train at the , national stadium later tonight ahead of tomorrow#s clash with FC Chikhura Sachkhere.McInnes said: #Stevie May won’t travel as he has a few things to sort out.”Winger Connor McLennan and Ethan Ross also remained in the Granite City having picked up knocks in a pre-season friendly with Highland League Keith at the weekend.McInnes said: #Ethan Ross and Connor McLennan picked up little strains from the game on Saturday at Keith which is disappointing.#Neither of those two boys will travel.#Midfielder Craig Bryson is in contention to make his debut tomorrow having been ruled out of the ties against RoPS Rovaniemi with an ankle ligament injury.New signing Funso Ojo, a £, capture from Scunthorpe, is also set to make his debut.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

President Alan Patterson.Jamie managed to keep control of his emotions, but it was clear that the honour meant a great deal to him as he fought back the tears.\"I trust that I have carried out my duties of office to the satisfaction of my fellow townspeople. My year in office has been a very eventful and enjoyable one. Rosie and I have been guests at many Border Festivals and enjoyed each one immensely.ldquoIrsquod like to thank my supporters and their lasses for all their advice, my family for all their help, and Rosie for accompany me and helping me make this year so successful.Mr Patterson thanked the outgoing Standard Bearer and said he had \"worthily upheld his stewardship\".Cheers erupted in the hall as Ronan was called up to the stage to be installed as Standard Bearer for .Mr Patterson said: ldquoYou have been called to this high office and your past record shows by word and deed that you justly deserve this honour. Guard this Standard securely and bear yourself well that you may long retain the trust of your fellow townspeople.\"Standard Bearerrsquos Lass Caitlin Urquhart, was then called upon to invest Ronan with his sash and buss his colours.After cheers that raised the roof off the historical hall, Caitlin was presented with her Cleikum Brooch.Addressing the audience, the newly installed Standard Bearer said: \"It is a great honour for me to be chosen as Standard Bearer of my native town, which at this time celebrates the traditions associated with its history. To our Dux Boy, Aaron, who tonight keeps alive the memory of our Patron Saint, St. Ronan, I tender my congratulations and best wishes for a successful year in office.\"As Standard Bearer for , it will be my earnest endeavour to honour the memory of the founders of St. Ronanrsquos Border Games by carrying the Blue Banner of St. Ronanrsquos for the ensuing year. My thanks to you, Mr President, to my Right and Left Hand Supporters and to you, ladies and gentlemen for the reception you have accorded me tonight.\"Proudly holding the banner at the memorial for the fallen, the rain battered down upon the new Standard Bearer who never flinched.He said: ldquoIt was the one and only time I would get to experience that moment as the Standard Bearer so I wasnrsquot going to let the rain bother me. I just tried to take in that moment.Ronan told us that being installed as the Standard Bearer is a ldquodream come true.ldquoIt has been an amazing week.

the children done fantastic in their roles.Ronan has carried on what has become a family tradition, with his name being added to the long list of Standard Bearers at St Ronanrsquos Wells.He told us:

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"junior girls great carradale canter champions","story":"Kirstie finished last Sunday#s race, which took her through Carradale#s streets and woodland, in  minutes and  seconds.She was closely followed by second-placed under- girl, Niamh Quinn, who finished in  minutes and  seconds.Both girls were ahead of second-placed ladies# k finisher, Margaret Sinclair, and Kirstie ed home just before first-placed lady, Amy Armour.More than  athletes competed in the event, now in its fth year.

There are still spaces available in weeks five and six for both under-s in the morning lessons and adults in the afternoon lessons.Last weekend also saw the club hosting Cushendall Sailing Club for theleg of their annual race.The club’s relationship with Cushendall goes back more than  years with both clubs visiting each other every year and holding a yacht race with the inidual winner over both legs winning the North Channel Shield and a prize for the winning team.This year there was no race when Campbeltown visited Cushendall as there was not enough wind and so all was to play for when the race began last Saturday afternoon.This year#s inidual winner was James Farrell, skipper of Sigmania, a Sigma  from Cushendall. A worthy winner, James is a highly experienced sailor and has coached the Northern Ireland dinghy sailors at international level. The team prize also went to Cushendall.The event is not all about the yacht race, as the social side is also very enjoyable and friendships have been made and sustained over the years.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

Daniel Radclfe, Harry Potter as was, cried not once but twice and it was touch and go at other times. So far, so predictable. Yet Radclfersquos story turned out to have twists and turns his literary mucker JK Rowling would have envied, so out of a clear blue sky did they appear.Who Do You Think You Are, now in its th series, is at its best at such times, when the viewer reckons they have a handle on the subject but it turns out they do not. Who would have thought, for example, that Jeremy Paxmanrsquos great great grandmother had been a Glaswegian widow living in such poverty with her nine children that it would make the normally clear-eyed journalist weep : Damien Loves TV guideWith his casting director mother, literary agent father, and west London childhood, Radclfersquos story appeared asit would be straightforward enough. Perhaps a bohemian twist or two lay in store, connections to someone famous in the theatre.The first sign of something more complex was a name change on his great grandmotherrsquos side, from Gershon to Gresham. While this could have been a way of anglicising a Jewish surname, not unheard of at the time, Radclfe, with the help of experts, dug deeper.He had known about a great grandfather who was a diamond merchant in Hatton Garden, and that his le had ended tragically. It did not take too much digging to uncover the facts. While doing so, Radclfe was also given a picture of the Britain of the s, a grim place riddled with anti-Semitism.Radclfe, now , was handed the last thing his great grandfather had written, a letter to his we, Rachel. He was in tears before the first paragraph had ended, and he was not alone. ldquoIt is so funny to feel this connection to someone you donrsquot know, he said. And he did feel a bond. There were phrases here that he used, similar endearments he deployed. Coincidence, chance, or something more mysterious There was another sad story, this one was a more commonplace tragedy, the loss of a young man in the First World War. The soldierrsquos letters home had survived, and extremely moving they were, too.

It is dficult to envisage a Brexit-tarnished Conservative Government seeing the need to do anything, especially one led by an Ultra Brexiter, no matter how opportunistic his Brexitism.However here would be an opportunity for the SNP Government, in spite of the fiscal challenges currently facing it, to show us what it is really made of. Here would be an urgent need for the spiritual communities to demonstrate what is truly at the core of their beliefs.I make no excuse for believing that Christians for instance ought to have a Jesus-inspired input into politics.John Milne, Uddingston.IT is somehow fitting and not a little ironic that the painful Greek tragedy that is Brexit should now become the burden of a man with a degree in Classics who has enabled much of the ision and uncertainty we now experience to take place.Boris Johnson will become Prime Minister of the UK this week, approved by the Tory party faithful, many of whom regard him as their saviour but regarded by the rest of the country as a mendacious and bungling buffoon. Martha Vaughans article on the gaffes of Mr Johnson,perceptively summarises the reasons why so many Britons await Mr Johnsons premiership with genuine anxiety and trepidation.The political carnage of Brexit has presented the ruthlessly ambitious Mr Johnson with his chance to lead Britain out of the EU and to \"take back control \"as his Leave campaign vowed to do. Unfortunately, both he and the very people who promised to take back control are utterly incapable of exercising it, even over themselves. The Brexit process is rudderless and currently careering towards the No Deal clf edge, the void filled only with empty and fancul rhetoric. For those of privilege like Mr Johnson and his acolyte, Jacob Rees-Mogg, social, economic and political consequences are irrelevant. Brexit is simply another Old Etonian game of chance where repercussions are for little people to suffer.In , on the eve of the referendum, Mr Johnson penned two columns for the Daily , one stating that the cost of Brexit would be too high and one passionately in favour of leaving the EU. He gambled on supporting and then leading the Leave campaign as the best course open to his political ambitions. He is obviously not and never will be, a conviction politician. Like President Trump, he has made a career out of mendacity and political and moral evasiveness. His farcical kipper debacle recently was yet another failed attempt to pillory EU laws and practices and present them as risible. As a journalist he routinely lied about such things, famously claiming that EU food standards would ban prawn cocktail crisps in Britain, leading to the usual hysterical headlines in the right-wing press.Our Prime Minister in waiting, like his friend Donald Trump, is an unprincipled opportunist, serial bungler and thrives on chaos. As mayor of London he left pound million worth of abandoned extravagant plans in his wake which were dismissed as the whims of an archetypal English eccentric. It is my belief that like the President, he is also a racist and no stranger to casual misogyny.We in Scotland must now prepare for one of the most reactionary governments in modern times. Mr Johnson cares little for the Union in reality and views our devolved parliament with a mixture of indference and contempt. He has little actual support even among Scottish Conservatives, with the exception of sycophants like Ross Thomson and Douglas Ross. Mr Johnsons premiership,left unchecked, could witness the end of the United Kingdom in the not too distant future.Owen Kelly, Stirling.NO doubt David Cameron was right when he saw Boris Johnson as a liability to be kept out of Scotland during the referendum campaign . I am reminded of an occasion many years ago when I was in an STV studio one night invited to debate local government funding with this man with tousled blond hair up from London I had never heard of before. He asserted that Glasgow was well funded by the Conservative Government. I invited him to visit Milton in my constituency where the tenants of the council had not had a lick of paint on their stairwells for  years, and there were flats that were unlettable because they were in a state of disrepair and the council had no money to bring them back to standard. His reply was \"Well, why dont they do the job themselves \"This would seem to be an early example of his famous lack of grasp of detail.Maria Fyfe , Glasgow G.THE headline on Alan Rodenrsquos columnsaid it all. As the country is firmly wrapped in the nightmare of the Brexit duvet with a Conservative Party standing at the ready to inflict even more misery on the country, they will not be forgiven for their actions. Mrs May will be remembered for the worst defeat of any sitting government, Cabinet resignations by the barrowload and all as a result of her own Conservative Partyrsquos infighting over the EU.But it is the word \"resignations\" that is the warning shot of what is to follow. Even before the next incumbent of No  is announced we have had resignations and threats of resignation at the prospect of Boris Johnson becoming PM.Regarding Mr Rodenrsquos advise to Mr Johnsonthat on any future visit to Scotland, \"Mr Johnson must avoid appearing like a visiting foreign dignitary\", perhaps he should have given readers a reminder of the rather dismal record Mr Johnson has on foreign affairs.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"lionel-messi-plays-football-11-year-old-brit-holiday","story":"Anna ONeill, from Canterbury, Kent, filmed her son Mackenzie playing with the Barcelona forward and three other children, including Messis son Thiago -

All this while ndashone leaves aside the SNP for a moment ndash the polls have four UK parties closely grouped, none on more than  per cent of the vote.Jo Swinson and the LibDems ndash who did you think I was talking about  ndash have at least the advantage of a clear Brexit policy: to scupper it. Ms Swinson, like everyone advocating a second referendum, assumesthat it would offer an option to overturn the first result, and that that option would win.Still, the Liberal Democrats, like the Greens and the SNP, are internally united. Indeed, given that  per cent of the electorate voted Remain, itrsquos slightly mysterious that it took them so long to pick up those votes, though the European elections at last indicated a surge.They have only  Westminster MPs , a low place on the starting grid. Still, the Brexit Party, with similar poll numbers, will probably, as Ukip did, find it harder to translate support into seats than the LibDems, whorsquove always been doughty ndash many think dirty ndash election street-fighters. It seems quite likely, for example, that theyrsquoll pick up Brecon and Radnorshire next week.Another possibility is defections from other parties. The LibDems could double their parliamentary strength instantlythe non-aligned groups the Independentsand the Independent Group for Changefollowed Mr Umunnarsquos example ndash something as likely as not.There are, too, quite a few Labour MPs who believe Jeremy Corbyn neither deserves, nor is likely, to gain power, while Sir Ed Davey, who lost to Ms Swinson, hinted a couple of weeks ago that half a dozen Tory MPs dead set against ldquono deal might cross the floor to the LibDem benches. Cabinet resignations are mostly irrelevant, but defections are another matter.They would simultaneously Commons put us in General Election territory and Ms Swinson in a much stronger position. Itrsquos possible to imagine a situation, perhaps within weeks, where the LibDems might be not far behind the Nationalists in Commons numbers.While the LibDems wonrsquot take seats from the SNP over Brexit alone, therersquos no reason why they shouldnrsquot on other issues. If they pick up seats from Labour and the Tories in the rest of the UK ndash probably mainly in Remain areas, but also where the candidates are seen as hardline or unpopular for some other reason ndash itrsquos not at all dficult to imagine a scenario in which they exercise the balance of power and the ability to determine the nature of a future government.Itrsquos still hard to see them as the largest party, butMs Swinson plays a blinder and proves popular ,Mr Corbyn remains toxically unpopular,the Tories lose a lot of seats to the Brexit Party, and lots of Remainers vote tactically, even that may not be a total fantasy. Ms Swinson should probably be heartened by the vigour of Labour attacks on her time in office.Much depends not on the LibDems themselves, but on whether Boris Johnson can revive and hold together his party and deliver a Brexit Parliament can endorse, produce some plausible reason why not, or engineer some unforeseen electoral stroke of genius. None looks very likely, but that may be why the Tories endorsed him evenitrsquos a reckless   gamble he can do it, itrsquos pretty well certain no one  could.All the same, the LibDems have the same urgency when it comes to timing as the incoming Prime Minister. They need to muster their forces and strike before the end of October, becausethe UK leaves, the principal reason for anti-Brexit voters to back Ms Swinson vanishes. ldquoStop Brexit is not the same as ldquoLetrsquos apply to rejoin the EU.That will be the case even without a deal eventhe consequences are terrible, they are unlikely to be as apocalyptic as Remainers, for obvious reasons, now paint them. The political narrative and policy objectives will sht to adapting to the new circumstances.The imperative to get out in the next three months may be a sine qua non for saving the Toriesrsquo electoral bacon but therersquos an equal urgency for the LibDems to stop it by then, because itrsquos now not just their primary objective, but their chief raison drsquoecirctre.

We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy.

He said: ldquoI hated that, I tried very often not to say thank you because he was trying to justy what he was doing was for my own good.The inquiry was also told about a ldquopublic flogging of a number of boys in front of other pupils in the school hall.It was heard the ordeal had left them ldquoconfused as they never received an explanation as to why they were being hit.He said: ldquoI hadnrsquot seen anything like that before.ldquoIt was a ritual, they were sending out a symbolic message.ldquoThere was never any explanation as to why this was happening.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there.

Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.IFLAS is a global hub of inquiry, teaching, and dialogue on enabling the transition to more fair and sustainable societies.All that is pure Mikey Mouse to a true Scientist!!!Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green . For women it is only .%. As for shades of green —- no chance for men !Maybe that’s one of the reasons why some of themcan’t resist verbal battles.Green for GO and they can’t stop . 🔴Thanks to Brian for those interesting links. The second, albeit straight from a professor in the field, might also not pass Ian’s test, but both seem to provide plenty of evidence it is more than reasonable for the kids to be concerned.  If we can agree this as a reliable source it might then be possible to make more progress on whether the kids actually are right, and or have a right, to be concerned.The clue to where their bias lies is in the name #statutory Committee for Climate Change# not climate science or climate research but climate#change#Nigel Farage will save the world.I have never claimed the children have no right to feel concerned, just that school strikes are a pointless, stupid action endorsed but fools and the politically motivated, that is my opinion no more no less.Relax kids! Theres no proof of climate crisis worldwide, says self-proclaimed “true Scientist” Ian Tinkler, yet our national climate scientic advisors think there is. Who is right  Hint, Ian hasn’t shared where he gets his reliable info.The government listens to an armsindependent body of expects established by law because it knows there is a problem. Ali, however, spies a plot con. Some of Ali’s previous alien-culture ideas have been shown to be a little further to the right than those most Tories admit to, so we can but guess where he gets them from.John and Ian have both recently had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg. They, with Ian, are strongly pro-Brexit. There is a possible common connection  cause. The far-right internationally have begun to target Greta whilst denying the dangers of global warming. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read thearticle “Germany’s AfD turns on Greta Thunberg as it embraces climate change denial” from June th.The AfD is a extremist far-right racist party which democrats should oppose. The article ends by warning that far-right extremists are using troll armies to stir up hatred, distrust and anger.Oh and the vile culture that I object to is busy protesting outside Anderton School in Birmingham like you they are using children to push their agenda, while you hold the shield of “islamaphobia” over them to protect their bigotry from critique.Whoop, whoop. Anyone questioning Ian, Ali and John’s motivation s should read the . Peter Hamilton, you are priceless. Keep it up please your fountains of wisdom are priceless.Although he has disparagesthree times above, Ian references their articles when it suits, albeit selectively. For example, on July th above, he excitedly reported:“The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option#”However, had he dwelt on the full article,he would have realised the actual scientists involved perceive there is an urgent problem, that their solution is partial, that it can only really help - years down the line, and that other urgent actions are required. His position is quite far from theirs.Just in case Ian misses the point, the selective misuse of other scientist’s work isn’t what real scientists do. So “a sensible, intelligent and educated option”, for Ian, might involve a refresher course to help him avoid misassumptions and  claims. That would be a “more rational course of action” than attempting to maintain his current pretensions that nothing incan be trusted and that his unsubstantiated understanding of climate science can.Further to the above, I have never #had a pretty extreme go at climate protestor Greta Thunberg.# I merely pointed out her unfortunate mental illnesses intermated that she was, perhaps mentally exploited by her dysal family and the Greens ofEurope. No wonder she suffers from #selective mutism#, that is when her ultra-green father speaks on her behalf. To claim my motive is allied to Germany’s AfD, a neo-nazi movement is a lie and slander, no more no less, so typical of your tawdry comments..."},{"url":null,"title":"amaryllis takes top prize at shetland race first leg reception ","story":"The prizes for the Bergen to Lerwick leg of the Pantaenius Shetland Race were handed out at a civic reception at Mareel on Friday evening..

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pip blunder local woman must return more than","story":"A WEST Belfast woman has revealed she must pay back thousands of pounds in benefits after she was mistakenly refused PIP.-year-old Beechmount woman Catherine McLaughlin, who suffers from depression and anxiety, was previously in receipt of DLA but was refusedthe new PIP benefit following an assessment in September .The fall-out from that decision has now left her deep in debt.PIP has replaced DLA as part of welfare reform measures introduced by the Tory government.After she lost out on her disability benefits, the Department for Communities made Welfare Supplementary Payments to Catherine, which were introduced to soften the blow of welfare reform.However, after Catherine successfully appealed the decision not to grant her PIP, the department has written to her in attempt to reclaim ‘mitigation payments’ totalling £,.. This, she says, will leave her struggling to make ends met.Following their benefits blunder, the department now plans to take the money from Mrs McLaughlin’s existing benefits, which she depends on to survive.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs McLaughlin told how she felt like she had “committed a crime” during her PIP assessment.“When I went for the PIP assessment I went to Citizens’ Advice to help us out and a girl came along to represent me,” she said.“She was talking me through it outside because I got myself up to high doh over it.“When I went in the pressure just got the better of me. I was being asked questions and some of them I found hard to answer. I answered to the best of my knowledge, but I felt asI had committed a crime and I was in front of a  of judges.”Despite winning her appeal, she must now pay back £. per fortnight out of her already meagre benefits. As well as the impact on her mental health, Mrs McLaughlin said she will “struggle” just to make ends meet.“The only thing we had to live off was ESA, which was only £ between us,” she said.“Why are they sending us this letter a year later saying that we have to pay the money back  It came as a complete shock. I rang and explained the circumstances, but I was just told that I have to pay it back by law. I understand that they gave us the money to pull us through, but why did they leave it for a year and let it mount up  At the end of the day the fault lies with them, but we are the ones being penalised. She put me onto a debt management line and I was toldI didn’t agree to pay it then they would start taking it out of my benefits anyway because my money comes from them.“We’re trying to run a house, we have oil and food to pay for, we don’t have a car but we have buses and taxi fares to pay for too. It puts me under a lot of pressure. I was trying to work out what it’s going to cost me and it’s going to take over a year and a half to pay it. I don’t know how I’m going to afford it. I received a letter a few months ago about going back to work. I can’t start work due to my health issues, and I only have another year left on my ESA – I have to re-appeal that. I don’t knowI’m going to get it back or not, so how am I going to make these payments ”She added: “I was only starting to relax and feel a bit better lately. I’m on a lot of medication for it. This has put a lot of pressure on me. I was in a complete state over this letter, but there’s nothing I can do – they’re going to take the money anyway.”A spokesperson for the Department for Communities, said: “Welfare Supplementary Payments are available to existing Disability Living Allowance claimants who experiences a loss of benefit following a reassessment to Personal Independence Paymenthowever depending on a person’s circumstances they may be entitled to more than one type of WSP arising from loss of DLA.“Claimants who do not qualy for PIP and subsequently successfully appeal the decision receive Welfare Supplementary Payments equal to the weekly rate of their previous Disability Living Allowance payments. In the event of a successful appeal and in line with the legislation the Department carries out an adjustment on any arrears due to ensure that an overpayment does not occur hence the claimant does not lose out financially.“However, in some circumstances e.g. where a WSP is paid for loss of a Carers Premium the legislation does not provide for an offset process to allow arrears of Carers Allowance benefit to be adjusted following a successful PIP appeal. Instead all arrears of Carers Allowance must be paid to the carer and recovery of the overpayment of the WSP sought from the person who actually received it however again in these circumstance neither the claimant nor the carer has lost out financially.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cap on seats sold by belfast city airport lifted","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was agreed, as per Sinn Feins Notice of Motion, that ABC Council officers would explore the possibility of the local authority being represented at the August parade.However, at Mondays council meeting it was decided that a delegation would not attend the annual event.The DUP group leader on ABC Council, councillor Mark Baxter, said that his party objected to both motions and added that there was \"low interest\" in anyone attending the Pride parade.\"Based on the low interest across the chamber, with only four out of  councillors expressing any interest in attending, this was not seen as value for money,\" Mr Baxter added. \"With the distinct lack of interest from the very councillors who proposed the motion, a decision was taken that ABC Council does not formally attend the event.\"However, Sinn Fein councillor Paul Duffy, who proposed last months motion, said he would still attend the event and was very disappointed that the council would not be sending a delegation.\"Im deeply disappointed, not just for myself but for the whole community,\" added the Portadown councillor. \"The response Im getting from Protestants, Catholics and others has blown me away.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry.

Sarah is afraid to let her child out to play in the park as a result.“Since I’ve been there I’ve noticed non-stop partying, people taking drugs, someone was stabbed in the head, a person died over-dosing, a couple fighting outside, a paedophile overlooking the park had to be removed too.“People off their heads on drugs crashed into my car recently too when my wain was with me.

All seven charges from the first appearance on th April  remain.There is a collective view amongst residents in Balliniska Avenue and Heights that these anti-social iniduals must be removed but they feel Clanmil Housing isn’t taking decisive action.Sectarian abuse has also been witnessed in the area with people being called “Fenians” by a certain family.“Clanmil says it’s taking action but there are people who’ve been a problem for a while and they’re still living here. I don’t think they’re doing enough,\" Sarah said, \"realistically there should be strikes, but people with knives etc should be removed straight away.“How can you feel safe as a single mother with all this going on.”She added: “When I was looking for a house I had to be interviewed, so I don’t know how these people got in with criminal records.“Even today I seen the police here arresting people, it’s just constant now.“But they’re not going to force me out because I like living here.”Police responseResponding to the latest incident and addressing residents’, a PSNI spokesperson said that on Thursday, th July, police received a report of an altercation and anti-social behaviour in the Baliniska Heights area of Derry.On arrival of police there was no sign of this altercation.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.

Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has always had an interest in writing - right from his days at the University of Ulster, Coleraine, where he studied History and English.Even back then - some  years ago - he was jotting down ideas for stories from his rich creative mind.Over the past several years his hobby has stepped up a gear, thanks to a blog he has been writing - A Fractured Faith. There he and his we Fionnuala and his daughter Rebecca have been giving flight to their creative writing and commentary pieces.Stephen, who works as a civil servant, explained: “This is my first novel. About three years ago the name Kirkwood Scott popped into my head.Stephen and Fionnuala Black.“He’s very loosely based on my le in Belfast in my s. Kirkwood is a bit of a loser really, a university graduate in a dead end job who’s just been dumped by his girlfriend. He is still coming to terms with the murder of his father, a police officer, when he was younger.“Kirkwood suffers from OCD and it manests itself in a number of routines he has to carry out,he doesn’t terrible things will happen. “He has a voice in his head and he has given it a name - Augustus Skelly, the colonel of the toy soldiers he played with as a child.“An ancient evil is uncovered on the streets of Belfast and is about to emerge. “Skelly is the manestation of that evil and only Kirkwood and two of his friends- Harley and Meredith - have the power to stop it.”Kirkwood has long believed the voice in his head has simply been a figment of his imagination until he encounters a homeless woman on the streetwho is drawing a picture of Skelly in a notebook.

Harley was disabled as the result of a road traffic accident - Stephen’s daughter has spina bida and hydrocephalus.On the subject of getting his work published Stephen said: “I had to send out a pitch to agents and publishers. “I went for it and pitched to New York and London agents and got some good feedback. “That encouraged me and I tried other publishers, “I had my fair share of rejections but in the space of a week two small publishers accepted me. “Writing a book is the easy bit, getting published is the hard part.”Stephen’s book is available online and in print through Amazon, on the Fractured Faith blog or directly from the author.About FracturedfaithblogStephen Black’s blog - FracturedFaithblog - has developed quite an online presence with , followers on Wordpress,It covers a wide range of subjects but is essentially a showcase for Stephen’s writing.However, his we Fionnuala has also produced a series of articles for the blog.Stephen is a keen runner and that also features on his blog.He explained: “I write about my running a lot but it can be a hotch potch to showcase my writing.“I can be walking down the street and see something which gives me an idea for a story.“My we Fionnuala has encouraged me to do this.

They too pay rates. The fact unionist Cllrs came together to vote this proposal down is depressing.”Alliance councillor Eóin Tennyson has said ‘you cannot put a price on equality and acceptance’. “This would have been a small, but incredibly signicant gesture of support for the LGBTQ+ community in our borough but particularly for LGBT members of staff within the Council. It is particularly disappointing that the Ulster Unionists chose to vote this way, despite their leader Robin Swann stating just last month that their party would not stand for intolerance,” he added.SDLP Cllr Joe Nelson said: “It is another step to Ballygobackwards. This issue transcends our political isions and it is a slap in the face for those LGBTQ people either nationalist or unionist.”DUP Group Leader on council Mark Baxter said: “The original motion was debated and despite our objections to lighting of the buildings and flying of the flag, the motion received a majority in the council chamber. The part of the motion referring to the Council being represented at the parade was for exploration by officials with a report brought back to Monday evening’s full council meeting. Based on the low interest across the chamber with only four out of  Councillors expressing any interest in attending, this was not seen as value for money.”Mark BaxterUlster Unionist Cllr Louise McKinstry said: “The motion passed in the June meeting has not been overthrown. The motion has and will be carried out to the letter. The possibility of attending was explored and there seemed no appetite to attend as a corporate body. The civic building will still light up in rainbow colours and the flag will fly on the designated day. This decision does not preclude members from attending this event as a party representative or in a personal capacity.”‘Confidence in police on decline’ - Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

John Healy, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said “we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are apparently talking” but after two years without movement of any kind “we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry”. “Nevertheless, they mustn’t waste time. So much is at stakethey don’t want history to look back on this period and say – they promised so much but delivered so little. \"My advice would be: Don’t give up. Don’t let a dficulty today ruin the vision for tomorrow. We in business and industry will give you all the encouragement you need.” He was speaking more than  guests at the NI Chamber Annual President’s Lunch at Belfast City Hall. Mr Healy, who heads up Allstate in Northern Ireland, also said thata fresh bid to host the World Chambers Congress is successful, it could be worth around £m to the Northern Ireland economy. “We need action on the economy, on infrastructure, on health – addressing the drastic shortage of clinical nurses, for example – or on education,” he said. “The drt of our talented students to universities across the water or how we face issues like numeracy and literacy levels. “However, we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are now talking.
