He plays with them for a while, arranging them into amusing shapes, before selecting one that suits his mood. He has just reached a decision on the future of his career. “He had no regrets, but even so he felt a certain sadness.”Simenon also began his writing day by lining up his pipes on his desk, and one cannot help but wonder if, as he wrote these lines, he too felt a certain sadness. It was February 1972 and, after four decades of writing up to half a dozen novels a year, Maigret and Monsieur Charles would be his last.Its publication by Penguin Books later this month also marks the culmination of a six-year undertaking by the publishing house to reissue the series in its entirety, all in crisp new translations. This project has introduced a whole new audience to Simenon’s work, and provided long-standing fans with the chance to renew their acquaintance with the world of Maigret. When Simenon was asked how the Maigret novels differed from his other books – his romans durs – he described them as “sketches”. But are they more than that? Ninety years after the series was begun, are they still worth reading? Yes, and yes.The decision Maigret has made at the beginning of the final novel is to turn down a promotion to head of the police judiciaire. “He needed to get out of his office, soak up the atmosphere and discover different worlds with each new investigation,” writes Simenon. “He needed the cafes and bars, where he so often ended up waiting, drinking a beer or a calvados.” For this is, above all, what Maigret does: he waits. And he observes. For Maigret’s mission is not merely the solving of the crimes. The apprehension of the culprit is secondary to his desire to comprehend the motivations of his opponents. In Maigret’s Childhood Friend, he tells a suspect, “I’m not judging you. I’m trying to understand.” It’s a phrase that perfectly encapsulates both Maigret’s and Simenon’s work.The character of Maigret is introduced in Pietr the Latvian (1930). It’s a novel that bears some of the hallmarks of the hundreds of pulp novels Simenon had written in the previous years (a surfeit of action and exclamation marks), and this embryonic manifestation of Maigret is more of the alpha-male action hero than in the later novels: “He was a big, bony man. Iron muscles shaped his jacket sleeves. He had a way of imposing himself just by standing there.” But even at the very beginning, there was something else. Maigret has his pet theory: “Inside every wrong-doer and crook there lives a human being. What he waited and watched out for was the crack in the wall, the instant when the human being comes out from behind the opponent.”The eponymous Pietr is an elusive figure seemingly in possession of several personalities. It is Maigret’s goal not just to gather evidence of his guilt but to break down these identities: to reach an understanding of the man. This he does through patience and observation. The climax of the novel is not the protracted chase and brawl which precedes it, but comes when the two men share a bottle of spirits in the upstairs room of an inn and Pietr unburdens himself to his confessor.In 1948, Simenon was to provide something of a second introduction to Maigret. Maigret’s First Case predates Pietr the Latvian by some 20 years. Maigret is the 26-year-old secretary to Superintendent Le Bret of the Saint-Georges station in Paris. Simenon was by then at the height of his powers as a novelist, and the portrayal of the detective is now more nuanced. We find Maigret, the son of a Loire valley gamekeeper, cowed by the butler of a wealthy Parisian family, unsure how to act among the more seasoned cops. He is dogged, in his belief that status should not place anyone above the law, but is also riven by self-doubt and a sense of purposelessness: “Was it really a man’s work to hang around all day in a bistro, to watch a house where nothing happened?” he wonders. He recalls his early ambition to become a doctor, then more vaguely to be a kind of sage whom people consult: “a repairer of destinies, because he was able to live the lives of every sort of man, to put himself inside everybody’s mind.” This is Simenon’s supreme virtue as a novelist, to burrow beneath the surface of his characters’ behaviour to empathise.The plot of Maigret and Monsieur Charles concerns the murder of a wealthy playboy-lawyer, a man who like Pietr the Latvian leads a kind of double life. The prime suspect is his estranged alcoholic wife, Nathalie, a former nightclub hostess, but the question that most vexes Maigret is not that of her guilt or innocence, but that of how she can tolerate her “suffocating existence”. It is a crime novel, yes, but more than that it is an investigation into how we become what we are, and how we become entrenched in lives we might not wish to lead.One does not read the Maigret novels in expectation of wild revelation or plot twists, but to inhabit the vividly realised world of Parisian streets, es, bistros and high-class hotels. If the books are sketches, they are the sketches of an old master. But the thread that runs though all the books is Maigret’s inquiries into the psychology of his adversaries, and it is this unfailing humanity that makes the Maigret books truly worth reading.Graeme Macrae Burnet’s second novel, His Bloody Project, was shortlisted for the 2016 Man Booker PrizeRupert Davies introduced Jules Amédée François Maigret, police detective and commissaire of Paris’s Brigade Criminelle, to British audiences in a BBC series from 1960-63. Each of the 52 episodes opened with an atmospheric Ron Grainer theme tune.Michael Gambon took over the sleuth’s role from Richard Harris, who played him in the film Maigret (1988). Gambon’s laconic Maigret made 12 appearances in 1992-93.Rowan Atkinson played Maigret in 2016 in ITV’s feature-length dramas set in 1950s Paris. Atkinson said he had been “a devourer of Maigret novels for years” and was finally playing someone closer to his real self."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/473a87e1c43c9cc59c9f029276795c87a22509b5/0_218_6542_3926/master/6542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=694becd028ad110e7a099099e014bbe3","title":"debenhams closures the full list of stores to shut","story":"Nineteen stores are to close this month as the chain fights for survivalList of Debenhams store closures* York, Haverfordwest and Orpington closed in December"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc243f7bf0fe0b2362cdd17af48c04276c4e5251/0_78_4119_2471/master/4119.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e933cadc6cb457607172a5772db766fe","title":"hmv confirms three stores are closing with job losses expected","story":"Entertainment retailer warns 10 more shops could shut unless landlords offer new termsHMV has warned of possible job losses as it fights to keep open stores across the country in the face of high rents and business rates.Three HMV stores are closing this month, the music retailer confirmed, while a further 10 stores could be axed if new deals with landlords are not secured. The nationwide closures would also result in job losses, HMV said.Closing down signs have been put up in many of the stores, which are also holding “everything must go” sales.The beleaguered music retailer, which last year was saved after falling into administration, confirmed that HMV Bury St Edmunds, Fopp Glasgow on Byres Road and HMV Nuneaton will shut at the end of January, with new tenants already lined up to move into the properties.In a statement, HMV said the stores were no longer viable due to “extortionate” business rates in certain locations.The announcement came as the department store chain Debenhams said it was due to close 19 of its stores between 11 and 25 January, with a further 28 reportedly set to close in 2021.HMV said it was also relocating in Lincoln and Plymouth, with new stores opening in both cities at the start of February.“There are currently 10 stores where negotiations with landlords are ongoing and we are hopeful of securing new deals,” a HMV spokesman said. “The closures are no reflection on our superb staff and where we are not able to come to a new agreement or relocate staff within the business elsewhere, unfortunately this does mean some of our staff will lose their jobs.”The 10 stores that are subject to negotiations are in Birmingham Bullring, Cribbs in Bristol, Edinburgh’s Ocean Terminal, Glasgow Braehead, Grimsby, Leeds, Merryhill near Dudley, Reading, Sheffield’s Meadowhall mall and Worcester.Fans of HMV expressed their displeasure on social media at the closures, with one saying the move was “disgusting”.HMV was purchased in a rescue deal by music mogul Doug Putman in February 2019 after it crashed into administration for the second time in five years in December 2018.Putman, who runs the Canadian retailer Sunrise Records, closed 15 stores after beating off a bid from Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley.In October Putman opened the Vault, which is the biggest music and movies outlet in Europe. The Birmingham store, which is the size of a supermarket, stocks 80,000 CDs and 25,000 vinyl albums. The company confirmed the Vault would not be affected by the closures.Putman previously said he hoped to reopen the stores that were closed when he bought HMV last year, including the Oxford Street flagship in London.Speaking to the  in February, Putman said he was optimistic that these outlets could be reopened: “Where certain stores have closed, our public have really rallied around and I credit that with some of the landlords coming back to us. They can see how much support we are getting.”Putman said he was in talks with landlords of several of the stores that were closed. As well as Oxford Street, these included the Trafford Centre in Manchester, Meadowhall in Sheffield, Westfield in White City, west London, and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, all prime locations.At the time, Putman also pledged to invest at least £10m in reviving the chain and wants to make his shops part of local communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02e8f077939fe9e160a3704e40f9f31823c5b68c/0_123_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e0d55bf678f56cee931b0261a655efa","title":"australias pathetic pm reveals much about the rights efforts to deny reality","story":"From Scott Morrison to Brexiters, there is a wilful reluctance to address the truthThere are worse leaders than Scott Morrison.

But no leader in the world is more abject than the prime minister of Australia.He cuts a pathetic figure. A leader must speak honestly to his people in a crisis. The sly tactics of climate change denial, the false consoling words that it’s a scare and we can carry on as before, have left Morrison’s words as meaningless as a hum in the background. Nothing he says is worth hearing.Australian English is rich in its descriptions of worthless men: as useful as tits on a bull, a dry thunderstorm, a third armpit, a glass door on a dunny, a pocket on a singlet, an ashtray on a motorbike, a submarine with screen doors, a roo-bar on a skateboard. Morrison is all of the above, but a British saying sums him up: “too clever by half”. Morrison won last year’s Australian general election, although his conservative Liberal party was expected to lose, by slyly mobilising opinion against tax rises in general and environmental taxes in particular.The climate change denialism he espoused is a moving target. In the 1990s, lobbyists funded by the oil industry acted as if the overwhelming majority of scientists who understood the subject were in a conspiracy against the public. They accused the authors of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports of being guilty of a “major deception” when they discussed the human influence on climate. Many still hold to the original sin of this denialism.Even as Australia burned last week, Tony Abbott, Morrison’s conservative predecessor, was still saying the world was “in the grip of a climate cult”. Abbott proved he was willing to make others suffer for his wilfully ignorant belief by scrapping a carbon tax when he was in power in Australia in 2014. A fallback position is emerging. It accepts that manmade climate change is real but withdraws the concession as soon as it has been made and loses it in an obfuscatory smoke.The final fallback and the final degradation will come, I predict, in the mid-2020s when the right abandons denialism completely, admits that climate change is catastrophic, but adds it’s far too late to do anything about it, which it may well be.Scott Morrison is hunkered down in stage two. He grudgingly acknowledges the existence of man-made climate change but hurriedly adds that other causes are at work. The climate has always changed and it’s not worth bearing the costs of challenging a polluting culture. It worked in last year’s elections, but sounds absurd today.“By not recognising climate change as a serious threat you fail to prepare overworked, underappreciated first responders for larger, more frequent bushfires that devastate communities,” said one previously solid Morrison voter, after he had learned the truth about conservatism as his family waited to be evacuated from a New South Wales beach.Despite its failure, perhaps because of its failures, the do-nothing Australian right remains admired across the conservative world. The 2019 election was meant to be a climate change election about the killing of the Great Barrier Reef, the extreme drought and average summer temperatures across the continent hitting 40C. Yet Morrison and his campaign team managed to turn it into an election about the Australian Labor party’s tax plans.So impressed was Boris Johnson that he hired Morrison’s boys to win the British general election. Fawning coverage followed of the digital “whiz-kids” from New Zealand: Sean Topham, 28, and Ben Guerin, 24. In Australia, the hotshots refined their technique of dumping hundreds of crude variations on the same theme on social media. They described how Labor would raise taxes and warned that a proposal to encourage electric cars threatened motorists. Labor wanted to hit “Australians who love being out there in their four-wheel drives”, said Morrison, as his propagandists targeted ads at owners of Ford Rangers, Toyota Hilux and every other popular model, saying that Labor would increase the price of “Australia’s most popular cars”. In Britain, the same team banged home the crude message in a thousand different ways that Johnson would “get Brexit done”.Politicians and political journalists who eulogise the cunning of clever operators aren’t being wholly asinine. How a party wins a campaign remains a matter of importance. But not one of them added, after the praise for the wise guys and whiz-kids had ended, that the boys from the Morrison campaign were the Neville Chamberlains of Australian politics who had convinced Australians to ignore the greatest threat to their nation’s security. It’s as if crime writers spent their time detailing the cunning of criminals while never mentioning the victims left bleeding on the floor.The Brexit Morrison’s operators helped to sell to the British is, like climate change, an exercise in three-stage denial. First comes the refusal to admit there will be pain. Then a guarded concession that there may be “bumps in the road” and,, you can predict, in a couple of years, when it is too late to save the car factories and science parks, will come admission that Remainers were right, but that doesn’t matter now.When Morrison won the Australian general election and the gilets jaunes forced Macron to scrap his proposed fuel tax, liberals received stern lectures about how people did not want to meet the cost of fighting climate change the point was a good one. After Leave won the 2016 Brexit referendum and Johnson won the 2019 general election, lectures on how voters did not want to be told that Britain was making a terrible mistake followed in turn. Of course, they were true too.But it is also true that you cannot postpone a rendezvous with reality forever. Whatever memes the right pushes out, whatever social media strategies they adopt and propaganda they trumpet, the lesson the refugees on Australia’s beaches know too well is that fire still burns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/417a5b572086402ade270cf0bf6140a0176e77ed/0_76_6113_3668/master/6113.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ea54e6422cdd68e01823c293e7e3b71","title":"stars in their eyes meets teletubbies is the masked singer tvs weirdest show","story":"With its celebrities disguised as unicorns and giant ducks, this bizarre singing contest has proved a huge hit in the US. Now it has designs on the UKModern Toss on The Masked SingerFrom the personal boundary-decimating blancmange that was Mr Blobby to a satin-clad Ann Widdecombe being dragged across the dancefloor to the strains of Wild Thing, Saturday night TV has long been built on inanity, ridiculousness and highly disconcerting fever dream sequences. But this month the schedules are destined to become that little bit more hallucinatory thanks to The Masked Singer, a show that makes that time Dale Winton forced celebrities to hurl themselves through holes in a giant foam wall seem like an entirely rational and restrained way to entertain a nation.A fur-coated Frankenstein’s monster of a format, The Masked Singer takes a cast of celebrities and conceals their identity behind elaborate and frequently terrifying animal costumes. These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with ining the star behind the disguise. In each episode, via a complex judging process, one contestant is unmasked to squeals of frenzied excitement. Essentially, Saturday night TV is about to be filled with the sight of a giant rubber duck performing Like a Virgin in a conical bra, as Jonathan Ross, Davina McCall, Rita Ora and The Hangover star Ken Jeong make wild, baseless guesses about the bird’s true identity. And if versions of the show that have already aired in Thailand, Mexico, France or the US – where it was the highest-rated show on network TV last year – are anything to go by, it is likely to be a smash.The UK is actually relatively late to the nightmare-inducing shindig that is The Masked Singer. In a pleasing inversion of the traditional west-to-east TV-globalisation narrative, the show started life as a South Korean format now 22 countries have their own versions. Why has this patently bonkers concept taken off in such a big way?For Jeong, who is also a panellist on the US version, The Masked Singer’s appeal lies in its detachment from reality. “It’s pure escapism,” he says. “In a world where the political landscape is very intense globally, it’s a palate cleanser. There is nothing partisan or political about this show.” By the same token, you could view its WTF-ery as a reflection of surreal times: gobsmacking political developments and outrageous opinions now form society’s bassline hum – perhaps we need something even stranger to cut through the noise.The long-term sustainability of all this internet chatter is dependent on one factor: genuinely good celebs. Unlike the obscurities that bulk up the Strictly and I’m a Celebrity lineups, each star has to be recognisable in order to secure that big reveal high – the US version has attracted the likes of Seal and Gladys Knight, while the Korean show even featured Ryan Reynolds (performing Tomorrow from Annie from behind a cardboard unicorn mask). This relatively high-quality guestlist has a knock-on effect on the show’s tone.“With celebrity comes a lot of fragile ego, so in the US version we were taught not to be too savage,” Jeong explains. “They’re all millionaire celebrities – they may not come back the next week if I’m too critical!” The show doesn’t just ditch the eviscerating critique of baddies such as Simon Cowell and Craig Revel Horwood the chronically flummoxed panellists don’t really offer any feedback at all. The glossy TV talent show, it would seem, has also had quite enough of experts.What The Masked Singer can’t get enough of, however, is celeb reverence. The climax of each episode is the unmasking – and the awestruck hysteria that surrounds it. Such fawning doesn’t seem like a very British activity, though: will the show go down as well on this side of the pond? McLean thinks so. “We are British and very restrained but even so our panel was going crazy.”He is also of the mind that, despite the show’s Korean origins, it fits in with our light-entertainment heritage. “It feels like a very British show – it’s got all the tropes of dressing up in silly clothes, guessing games, parlour games.” It is true that there are shades of classic Brit TV in The Masked Singer at times it seems like the unholy alliance of Stars in Their Eyes, Through the Keyhole and Teletubbies.It remains to be seen whether Britain will embrace The Masked Singer in the way other countries have. Will its hair-raising absurdity and bombastic witlessness bring the public together? Can we put aside our differences to brainstorm the identity of the man singing Black Magic dressed as a debonair hedgehog? Will we unite in ecstasy when the haunted bee-doll hybrid finally removes her mask? For the sake of our embittered, ided nation – and the future health of Saturday night TV – let’s hope the answer is yes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

They were advised not only to avoid drinking the water, but also touching it – no showers, no baths, not even hand-washing.Boiling the water would only increase its toxicity while drinking it could cause “abnormal liver function, diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, numbness or dizziness”, read a statement from the City of Toledo, warning residents to “seek medical attention if you feel you have been exposed”.Toledo sits on the shores of Lake Erie, one of North America’s five great lakes. About half a million residents of the city and surrounding area have relied on Lake Erie for water for hundreds of years.After the news broke on 3 August bottled water quickly vanished in concentric circles around the city. Eventually, a state of emergency was called and the national guard arrived with drinking water.Toledo’s water crisis lasted for nearly three days. But the water wasn’t toxic due to an oil spill or high lead levels, as in Flint, Michigan. Toledo’s water was tainted by something altogether different: an algae bloom.Toledo is not alone. According to scientists, algae blooms are becoming more frequent and more toxic worldwide. A 14-month long algae bloom in Florida, known as the “red tide”, only ended earlier this year, after killing more than 100 manatees, 127 dolphins and 589 sea turtles. Hundreds of tonnes of dead fish also washed ashore. In 2018, there were more than 300 reported incidents of toxic or harmful algae blooms around the world. This year about 130 have been listed on an international database, but that number is expected to increase.Recent reports of a new ‘‘red tide’’ emerging in Florida and more dead wildlife have put the tourist and fishing industries on alert, braced for further devastation. The causes of the blooms vary, and in some cases are never known, but in many parts of the world they are being increasingly linked to climate change and industrialised agriculture.Algae includes everything from micro-algae, like microscopic diatoms, to very large algae, such as seaweed and kelp. Algae are not officially a taxonomic group of creatures (they don’t fit into general groups like plants, animals or fungi), but the name is generally used to describe marine or freshwater species that depend on photosynthesis.An algae bloom occurs when a single member of these species – because of certain conditions – suddenly becomes dominant for a time.Algae are vital to our survival. It’s estimated that at least half of the planet’s oxygen comes from these unsung creatures, who produce it through photosynthesis before releasing it into the water. Algae, like land plants, also sequester carbon dioxide scientists have explored their potential to draw carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. They have been used as fertiliser, food sources (such as seaweed), and could be a promising source of biofuel in a more sustainable world.However, some algae blooms can also be harmful – even lethal.Harmful algae bloom (HAB), as scientists have come to describe the phenomenon, often manifest by forming a kind of scum over a body of water that can be green, blue, brown or even red. But others are completely invisible. The problem has become increasingly widespread and the impact can be deadly to marine life.Off the eastern coast of the US, a dinoflagellate – a type of marine plankton named Alexandrium catenella – has the potential to make shellfish lethal. Its appearance routinely shuts down fisheries, crippling local economies. And it’s not just in the US: the same species has shut down mussel farms and recreational collecting of shellfish as far away as New Zealand.Other blooms wipe out marine life. In 2015, a bloom of various dinoflagellates off the coast of South Africa led to low-oxygen conditions, known as eutrophication, killing 200 tonnes of rock lobster. Freshwater blooms, like those in Lake Erie made up of cyanobacteria or blue-green algae, have not only shut down local water sources but have also been blamed for the death of dogs that had been swimming in them.It’s difficult to make generalisations about harmful algae blooms since specific species have different causes and impacts. Scientists have identified about 100 toxic bloom species in the oceans. Dozens of potentially harmful species of cyanobacteria are known to affect bodies of fresh water.During most of the past century, harmful algae blooms were rarely headline news, inspiring little scientific study beyond ecological curiosity. That has changed. Algae blooms are notoriously difficult to predict, but a global monitoring group known as HAEDAT is tracking them across the world as they occur. Harmful algae blooms, such as the one that hit Toledo’s water supply in 2014, are becoming more common and more toxic – and scientists say humans are to blame.“There’s no question that the HAB problem is a major global issue, and it is growing,” said Donald Anderson, director of the US National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms and a lab director at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute. “We also have more toxins, more toxic species, more areas and resources affected, and higher economic losses.” The toxic bloom that took over Lake Erie in 2014 was formed by a cyanobacteria known as Microcystis Aeruginosa, for which farming is at least partly to blame.“You have people that still to this day will only use bottled water,” says Dr Timothy Davis, an expert in plankton ecology at Bowling Green University, five years after the water crisis and even after Toledo spent $132 million (£101 million) on improving its water treatment plant to handle the blue-green algae.Lake Erie, the shallowest of North America’s Great Lakes, has seen such events in the past. During the 1950s and 60s algae blooms were common, most likely, say researchers, due to poor domestic and industrial wastewater treatment.“At one point, Lake Erie was considered a dead lake,” Davis says. But by the early 1970s, the “dead lake” was resurrected, due to new regulations from the Clean Water Act and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that capped phosphorus loads into the lake at 11,000 tonnes. Phosphorus provides nutrients to plants and is commonly found in manure and produced for fertiliser.Then in the late-1990s, blooms began to reappear. A cyanobacteria bloom requires two things: nutrients and heat. In the case of Lake Erie, nearby farms have become increasingly reliant on large inputs of synthetic fertiliser.“If you have an agricultural system where the farmer can only survive by polluting Lake Erie, then there’s something fundamentally wrong with that system,” says Dr Thomas Bridgeman, director of the Lake Erie Center.Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has seen a bloom every year – and they appear to be lasting longer and getting larger. This year’s bloom in Lake Erie was the fifth largest since 2002 – when monitoring began in earnest. It was 620 square miles at its largest after growing throughout August, before dissipating in September.Meanwhile, climate change has heated up our planet substantially. Nearby Lake Superior, the most northerly of the Great Lakes and the world’s largest, has had its first documented cyanobacteria blooms over the past decade. Before climate change, the lake simply would have been too cold for a long-lasting bloom.It’s now almost a certainty that blooms will continue to appear every summer, say researchers, unless Ohio changes its agricultural practices and the global community finally tackles the climate crisis.“We have to look around and say, ‘Look, what do we grow here?’” says Bridgeman. “We grow corn and soya beans. Where does the corn go? It goes into our gas tanks. Where do the soya beans go? They go to China, they go to hogs. Is that really what we want to be doing with our watershed?”Algal blooms are also becoming more common and severe in many parts of our oceans, harming wildlife and posing potentially dangerous health impacts for local communities.Scientists say the “red tide” that stuck around the Florida coast from 2017 through to this year may now be a semi-normal part of the ecosystem.These blooms are pumping poison into the air, known as brevetoxin, which may be harmful to humans if inhaled. Anyone breathing it in can suffer from uncontrollable coughing and a sore throat. “It doesn’t make for a pleasant day at the beach,” says Malcolm McFarland, a researcher into algae blooms with the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fort Pierce, Florida.It may have long-term health implications as well – one study found that brevetoxin attacked the DNA of lungs in rats, but further research is needed to understand the impact on human health.Scientists are less certain about the causes of these red tide marine blooms, but both nutrient runoff and climate change may play a role. “The red tide seems to initiate and peak in the rainy season when runoff from the land is highest, and nutrient inputs to freshwater and coastal water bodies spike,” says McFarland.Meanwhile, on the other side of the north American continent, a different red tide is attacking a different species: California is seeing more sick sea lions taken in by rescue centres pups and adults are dying.Scientists believe they are suffering from eating fish tainted by Pseudo-nitzschia australis algae. The highly toxic algae are fatal at high doses, both to sea lions and humans.Unlike Florida’s red tides, those in California appear to be a very recent arrival. Until the turn of the millennium, large-scale toxic blooms were rare off the coast of California. Then something changed.Europe has had its own experience of deadly algae blooms that now threaten the future of its fisheries. Last year, the Baltic Sea experienced a bloom so large it could have encompassed Manhattan, and it closed beaches from Finland to Poland. Finland has been systematically sampling its area of the Baltic since 1979, giving us a clearer idea of the spread and growth of the problem, and what’s to blame. In that time, blooms have become larger and longer-lasting, creating dead zones and depleting Baltic fisheries.Like the example in Lake Erie, the Baltic bloom is caused by an influx of nitrogen from agriculture and warming waters.Scientists are regularly tracking nutrient loads from Finland’s rivers into the sea. Data from 2014 in the HELCOM Pollution Load Compilation database, the best currently available, found that more than three-quarters of the nutrient load coming into the Archipelago Sea is from agriculture. The number is surprisingly similar to the proportion coming from industrialised agriculture in Ohio.The Baltic is a brackish water body, thus supporting blooms typical of both fresh and salt water. But, as in Lake Erie, of real concern are cyanobacteria: several species have been known to produce blooms here.Below the sea’s surface there has been a decline in the more nutritious phytoplankton – and food for fish – and an increase in the potentially toxic cryptophytes in the more southerly parts of the sea since the early 1980s.Milder winters and increased rainfall pushing more nutrients into the sea, along with higher surface water temperatures – all due to the climate crisis – are also exacerbating factors, say researchers. Blooms usually begin in July and disappear by August or September. But last year a species particularly resistant to coldremained until November. “The ice was blue-green because of the cyanobacteria under it,” says Sirpa Lehtinen, an expert on plankton for the Marine Research Centre with the Finnish Environmental Institute, who adds that scientists are still trying to work out what this all means for the marine ecosystem, and whether fisheries in the Baltic are in serious long-term peril.So how can we solve a problem like algae? The answer, says Davis, will be part-regional, part-global solutions. For Lake Erie, it will require agricultural changes – including regulations to reduce the nutrient load – and tackling the climate crisis. But solutions elsewhere may be different, for example, blooms in developing countries might require better wastewater treatment.The 2014 water crisis in Ohio forced the issue politically which hasn’t happened in many other places. Governor Mike DeWine recently announced an initiative called H2Ohio, which is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for Lake Erie and other Ohio water bodies over the next 10 years. However, scientists say this is not enough.“It’s going to take a lot more money and a lot more political will than what’s happening right now,” says Bridgeman.At the Ohio Department of Agriculture,director Dorothy Pelanda said the department was primarily looking at voluntary programmes based on marketing and education for potential solutions such as cover crops and smarter use of fertiliser. In 2014, Ohio passed new regulations on fertiliser use for farms near the lake: such as not spreading before a storm or on frozen fields.“We know from science that there is not one solution to every farm … It’s about education, it’s about being sensitive to what works, what doesn’t work,” she said. She’s hoping to provide increased access for farmers to use high-tech, but often expensive, equipment that can give them a better idea of what parts of their land may need fertiliser and how much.Pelanda said she’s also seen interest in ersifying crops beyond corn and soya beans, to grapes, chestnuts and maple sugar. Asked if voluntary programmes will go far enough, Pelanda says: “That’s our challenge. We have to get beyond. We’re doing these things … but we’re not doing enough of these things. We need to really increase the voluntary adoption of these practices.”Others are more sceptical of voluntary approaches. “We have a long history in this country of a farmer does what he wants on his land. You can choose to take advantage of a programme or something, but you can also choose not to,” says Bridgeman, who believes local and federal governments can no longer afford to ignore the climate emergency. “We need to do something about climate change and we’re either going to be paying for it by reducing greenhouse gases or we’re going to be paying for it by additional treatment of water,” says Bridgeman, adding that most of the blooms around the world have a human element to them.One thing is certain. Algae blooms aren’t going away but are yet another sign – like ocean acidification, vanishing Arctic sea ice, and mass extinction of the Anthropocene – “of an ecosystem that is out of balance,” says McFarland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44bc2bc5b94a8f9e1f016b8cf38503111f0456bd/0_0_4567_2514/master/4567.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=55237428dec3c932e8fefea5b14021c2 1760w","title":"streaming netflix apple tv plus disney britbox","story":"Last year was transitional for the streaming scene, at least in the UK: the promised avalanche of major new outlets to dent Netflix’s dominance rumbled in the background, but showed itself only in snowy fits and starts.The long-threatened juggernaut of Disney+ was delayed on these shores, with a launch date unconfirmed for much of the year. Apple TV+ landed in November with less of a bang than expected: there was more confusion over technical matters of access than there should have been from a tech corporation of this magnitude, and its initial bouquet of programming underwhelmed. Only all-star drama series The Morning Show, despite mixed reviews, punched through into public consciousness, while Apple’s plans to take on Netflix in the prestige film stakes got off to a rocky start. A day before its premiere, potential Oscar contender The Banker was dropped from the schedule after sexual abuse allegations were levelled against one of its producers.Another heavily hyped streaming service finally hit the UK in the autumn. Two years after its popular US launch, we got BritBox, intended as an amalgamation of top programming from the BBC and ITV. It has been warily regarded in some quarters. “Why pay a monthly subscription for the free-to-air content covered by my licence fee,” runs the argument – not helped by a robust improvement to the Beeb’s trusty iPlayer service, which last year announced it would be keeping content to stream for up to a year rather than the previously stipulated 30 days. Still, BritBox has announced itself as a go-to spot for classic comedy and comfort viewing in the Midsomer Murders vein. Whether its reputation gets any sexier than that in 2020 remains to be seen.As for the year ahead, Disney+ naturally looms largest. When, at last, it arrives in the UK on 31 March – nearly five months after its glitzy Stateside debut – it’s hard to says whose sighs of relief will be loudest: parents impatient for the shiniest non-human babysitting service going, or Star Wars nerds champing at the bit for every new episode of The Mandalorian, the spin-off series that made Baby Yoda an exhausted internet meme well before the rest of the world even got to see it. (The preview episodes I’ve seen promise a knowingly silly space-horse-opera with more of a Saturday-matinee spirit of fun than The Rise of Skywalker.)Disney+ is already making its presence felt by absence elsewhere: Sky and Now TV subscribers may have noticed a heap of Disney-owned programming, from Marvel series to Grey’s Anatomy, vanishing from the service’s menu in recent days. On the flipside, a renewed deal between Sky and HBO means the most anticipated new US streaming service of 2020 – the glossy-looking HBO Max – is unlikely to be headed our way too. (Between this and the ongoing American exclusivity of outlets ranging from mainstream major Hulu to artsy Filmstruck replacement Criterion Channel, British viewers continue to lag behind in terms of streaming options.)Meanwhile, after that aforementioned soft start, Apple TV+ is looking to kick things up a notch this year. A deal for multiple TV series developed by Alfonso Cuarón should help, while Sofia Coppola’s new film On the Rocks will inaugurate its production partnership with high-end indie studio A24.Still, they’ve a long way to catch up with Netflix, whose 2020 film slate is positively mouthwatering. After making another run at the top Oscars with The Irishman and Marriage Story, it’ll be bringing us new films from David Fincher (the Hollywood biopic Mank), Charlie Kaufman (I’m Thinking of Ending Things), Andrew Dominik (his long-in-the-works adaptation of Joyce Carol Oates’s Blonde), Spike Lee (Da 5 Bloods) and George Clooney (Good Morning Midnight), among others.

Eyol are still bottom, four points from safety, and they still have not won at home this season but at the end of a proper derby on a noisy night in Cornellà it felt like they had.As the ball hit the net, the fans hit the roof. The adrenaline flowed, bringing with it the belief that they can avoid relegation and joy that they had come back to equalise against their local rivals.Maybe Abelardo Fernández, their third coach of the season, can revive them like he had Sporting and Alavés before. This was some start, that’s for sure – the kind that, while it changed nothing in the table, changed everything.A point was enough to take Barcelona back ahead of Real Madrid, who had gone top with a 3-0 victory over Getafe that was considerably harder fought than the scoreline suggests thanks to two goals from Raphaël Varane, one from Luka Modric and an impressive display from Thibaut Courtois.Raphaël Varane had a hand in two goals as Real Madrid won 3-0 at neighbours Getafe on their return to La Liga action.The French defender\u0027s aerial challenge led to David Soria\u0027s own goal and Varane, the goalkeeper failing to punch Ferland Mendy\u0027s clear, instead sending the ball into his own net.Varane doubled the visitors\u0027 lead shortly after half-time, staying narrowly onside to head home Toni Kroos\u0027s free kick after 53 minutes then headed in the second shortly after half-time.

Real Madrid lead the standings with 40 pointsIt was not enough to lift Eyol off the bottom of the table, but boy, did it lift them. For Barcelona, here was further evidence that, for all the glimmers of genius, this is not the team it once was.For a while, it looked like Eyol might even beat Barcelona in the league for the first time since Mauricio Pochettino was manager here, after David López headed them into the lead.Then it looked like they would lose when two wonderful moments from Luis Suárez early in the second half put Barcelona ahead once more. And then, against 10 men, Eyol got a late equaliser to finish the encounter with a real derby twist.By that point, the sedate start to the game seemed a long time ago. In the beginning, the ball was Barcelona’s and theirs alone.Yet while they dominated, they did little with it and on 22 minutes Eyol finally found a way out from deep and with it found a way to goal. A free-kick from the right bent into the area found David López leaping by the penalty spot and, all alone, he guided his header into the corner.Lionel Messi drew an easy save from Diego López soon after but Barcelona did not respond immediately, carrying little threat and circulating the ball slowly, until a flurry in the final five minutes. First Sergi Roberto stood up a cross that Messi, dashing in, ducked to head.Then Suárez turned superbly, slipped the ball between the legs of Bernardo Espinosa and, with his toe, hit a shot off the post. Next, Messi’s free-kick was caught by Diego López. And finally, Barcelona wasted a four-man break that ended with Antoine Griezmann and Messi unable to provide the finish.Instead, Suárez did. The reaction continued at the start of the second half, with Arturo Vidal replacing Ivan Rakitic, and it brought swift reward. Open on the left, Jordi Alba delivered towards the near post where Suárez opened his body and, first-time on the bounce, guided the ball past López with the inside of his right foot.If that touch was exquisite what came next was extraordinary, Suárez dinking a loose ball over the leg of David López, evading another opponent and then, on the bounce once more, playing a wonderful pass with the outside of his foot to the far post for Vidal to crash in a header.Chaos theory it might be but yet again the Chilean had changed the game. An hour in and Barcelona led. It might have been more as the game opened up, but Diego López saved from Suárez after Messi’s fantastic run.There was, though, more chaos to come. Eyol were handed a lifeline when Frenkie De Jong got his second yellow for hauling down Jonathan Calleri, and there was a roar when a header from Wu Lei – on as a sub – drew a save from Neto. That didn’t go in, but when he next escaped the defence it did, his firm, low effort flying in from the right side of the area. “Yes, we can!” Eyol’s fans roared at the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48cd2ae181a83241766520e8761fe675e40a4a49/0_159_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e1d16bb74413d1bf39546d47cc1669","title":"casey stoney manchester united wsl","story":"Promoted side’s first few months in WSL have exceeded expectations, says delighted managerMost promoted sides, paired away with last season’s runners-up in their opening match in the top flight, would not be particularly upset by a 1-0 defeat. But that was not how Casey Stoney saw Manchester United’s loss at Manchester City in September: “It is a strange feeling because you’re gutted you have just lost 1-0 to one of the best teams in the country but it’s because you competed so well and knew you could get more out of the game.” Her side have certainly not been treading water since in their first season in the Women’s Super League.United sit fourth in the table, level on points with Everton, one ahead of Reading, two clear of Tottenham. They are leading the best of the rest. On Sunday they launch themselves into the second half of the campaign against Bristol City. But with an eight-point gap between themselves and third-placed Chelsea there is still a jump to be made before they are competing at the top.That their aim is a top-half finish shows just how impressive United’s maiden top-flight season has been so far. “If we were looking at our position in the table and comparing it with where we’d have wanted to be we are maybe slightly exceeding what people would have expected for our first year,” reflects United’s head coach.There have been five wins and four defeats, but the detail paints a prettier picture. Three of those losses have been to title-chasing Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, tight 1-0 games all, with the newcomers acquitting themselves well. Their only other league defeat, a 3-2 loss to West Ham, having led twice, hurt. “It was the performance more than anything it was really disappointing from us,” says Stoney.“Even the game at the Etihad, we walked away from that really, really disappointed. We had lost 1-0 to a fantastic goal and created good chances ourselves. Now it’s about finding consistency in performances and finding a way to win when maybe you’re not at your best. But at the same time you always learn so much more when you lose.”The West Ham defeat stung more because it coloured their strong defensive record. After their opening two defeats in September, United went on a run of five clean sheets, but then conceded in all but one of their next six games in all competitions. Stoney, a former England defender, says her ”strength is in the defensive side of the game” and she is not worried about their form at the back waning a little. “I remind the team constantly, if you can keep a clean sheet you’ve always got a chance of winning the game. In the league none of those have come from open play, so we’re doing a lot of work on our defensive responsibilities at set pieces, making sure that we win first contact, making sure that we clear our lines when we need to.”Her strength in putting together a strong back line meant a penchant for attacking football surprised her when she went into management with United. “I’d like to think that when people come and watch us we play attacking football. We’ve got players in our dressing room that can hurt the opposition. But if your attackers are going to attack they need to know that the back door is shut. People will take more risks if they know that is happening behind them.”Lauren James, who has eight goals across all competitions, is beginning to mature into the player glimpses of her talent suggested she could be. There was an unusual barrier to her progress, says Stoney. “It might sound silly but I think turning 18 helped because for the whole year and a half before that she was in a separate changing room to everyone else, which is difficult. The minute she crossed over she became more a part of the team, has more cohesion now with the girls and she’s suddenly just grown up.”The 2-0 win at home to Manchester City in the Continental Cup also provided a crucial moment in United’s upward trajectory. “That was a very strong Man City team. It was an accomplished performance and it gave the players the belief that they can beat the top teams, that they can play at the top table and that they belong there.”But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of the season so far has been the liberation of Leah Galton. “When I first met Leah to talk to her about coming to the club she had completely fallen out of love with the game,” Stoney says. “My main job was to just get a smile back on her face and get her playing and enjoying it. I actually think Leah is one of our proudest achievements, because she’s playing. For me she is the best left-winger in the country because she’s naturally left-footed, can go inside and outside, she’s powerful, she’s quick, and she’s enjoying her football. I don’t think there’s many full-backs in the country that can cope with her.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddbce2c0a49fa5860984af931c768e0d4d383dd9/0_121_3622_2173/master/3622.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90b5f5a89ebb90549af3b31d75e41dbf","title":"manchester united wolves adama traore fa cup juan mata","story":"“You’re not famous any more,” sang the home fans in the Jack Hayward Stand, but that isn’t really true. Manchester United are still famous, it’s just not for the same thing any more. Once, as Steve Bull observed at half-time, Wolves would have feared United, but no longer. There was at least a semblance of pattern here, at least until they got into the final third, but unless they get an early goal and can counter, United rarely look like blowing opponents away.Once United wore red shirts that for more than 100 years had symbolised passion and attacking flair, a club that believed in doing things the right way. Here they wore black with orange detail, because they are a brand, far more adept at selling merchandise and growing their social media following than any of that dull 20th-century stuff like putting together a football team.Once they were renowned for their astuteness in signing and promoting youth, a facet always near the surface when they meet Wolves, given how they enticed Duncan Edwards from the Midlands. Perhaps it’s because they’ve promoted youth so successfully that the youths are now the players they rest for Cup games, but here it was Wolves’ youngsters, Pedro Neto in particular, who looked the more promising. Not that there was a huge amount of promise on either side. This was not a good game, one of those disjointed occasions that so often characterise the early rounds of the Cup when both teams field half-and-half sides.Although there were seven changes from the United team that lost so dismally at Arsenal on Wednesday, the sense was of a team selected with the aim of protecting Marcus Rashford and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, both of whom began on the bench. In the end, Rashford had to be called upon with 21 minutes remaining. He hit the bar immediately but that was a rare opportunity in anther drab display.It says much for the abject way in which United’s squad has been put together that the decision to rest Fred, coupled with the injuries to Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay, left them fielding both Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata in midfield. That might have been a reasonable prospect at Chelsea at the beginning of the last decade – although Mata’s time at the club came between Matic’s two spells there – but here it felt a little like using a Nokia 3310 in an era of smartphones. Sure, it can make a call, or ghost a free-kick just wide, but the result, hardly surprisingly, was that whenever a Wolves player got a run at them – and with Adama Traoré, Neto and the 21-year-old Benny Ashley‑Seal, Wolves had plenty of runners – there was danger.Traoré remains a gloriously unlikely figure, somebody whose bustling running style offers a perpetual reminder that the Argentinian verb for dribbling – gambetar – is derived from a gaucho term for the gait of the ostrich. This ostrich, though, is one that bears on its trim legs the upper body of a rugby league forward. Neto, a 19-year-old summer acquisition from Braga, is quick and a fine crosser with his left foot, but has the technical skills that Nuno Espírito Santo thinks his future may lie through the middle as a No 10. Ashley-Seal, making his first senior start for the club, was far from overawed against two central defenders with 59 international caps between them, even if there was little sign of the finishing ability that brought him a hat-trick against Carlisle in the EFL Trophy before he was withdrawn at half-time for the more proven figure of Raúl Jiménez.United may have had more possession than most away sides at Molineux, at least before half-time, but that is a mixed blessing for a team that is at its best when playing on the break and frequently seems to lack the wherewithal to unpick well-drilled defences. No shots on target is a damning statistic.Wolves played with a zip and sense of purpose United lacked and had far more in the way of clear chances. Perhaps that’s what you’d expect from a game between seventh and fifth in the league, even with all the changes, but those home fans were right: this is worryingly far from the old United."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58045f1f38a8bf22d0d33e84bb89cbf2dee82d59/75_108_2291_1374/master/2291.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=989e1a72cf9555a630f31fcf3fdde49e","title":"marcelo bielsa leeds united fa cup arsenal","story":"A t teatime last Sunday came perhaps the broadcasting highlight of the festive period, a moment both dramatic and farcical that was soundtracked by a high‑pitched Ayrshire voice shouting the phrases “Big Wes!” and “His own net!” in various combinations, the delirious syntax conveying the sense of the moment far more eloquently than a finely turned sentence could ever have done. As Alan McInally screamed himself hoarse, Leeds fans went berserk, players celebrated and coaches cavorted, Marcelo Bielsa took a walk across his technical area in his big padded coat, seemingly no more moved by the injury-time own goal from Wes Harding that gave Leeds United a 5-4 win at Birmingham than by tins of tuna being down to 38p in the Wetherby Morrisons.If that was Bielsa as the accidental hero in an action movie, walking casually away from the exploding building, New Year’s Day offered a very different kind of film. After his Leeds had drawn 1-1 at West Brom, there was a hug for Slaven Bilic which went on, and on. The camera cut away, showed some players walking off the pitch, lingered on the crowd, then went back. They were still in each other’s arms, gazing at one another in mutual admiration. They’ll always have the Hawthorns.The league, Bilic said, is lucky to have Bielsa. Leeds must feel incredibly blessed. It is not just that they top the Championship, that they stand nine points clear of Brentford in third and that they go to the Emirates in the FA Cup on Monday with a genuine sense of expectation.It is that they have in Bielsa a manager who, in a sporting world in which values have become hopelessly corrupted, seems to grasp both how essentially trivial football is and yet how it can ignite a region. It is a sign of his remarkable influence that in Mikel Arteta, Bielsa will be in the highly unusual position of facing a second-generation protégé, a manager whose profoundest influence was Pep Guardiola, who is open in acknowledging his debt to Bielsa.Bielsa probably should have won more in his career. Three league championships won under Argentina’s two-titles-a-year system and the 2004 Olympic gold is a meagre haul for somebody Bilic discusses in such revered tones. That is a failing but Bielsa’s entire career feels a rebuke to the idea a life can be measured out in trophies or medals.He is an obsessive. He comes from a wealthy family – his grandfather was a judge, his brother was Argentina’s foreign minister and his sister a provincial governor – and earns a reported £6m a year. Yet he seems to have little interest in the trappings of wealth. He lives in a one-bedroom flat above a shop in Wetherby, drinks coffee and holds team meetings in the Costa, shops in Morrisons and eats regularly at a local Italian restaurant called Sant Angelo. He walks the 45 minutes to training at Thorp Arch most days and rarely seems to wear anything other than his Leeds tracksuit.But he is aware of his obsession, knows just how ridiculous it is. At the beginning of the 1992 Clausura, after a dismal 1991 Apertura in which his Newell’s Old Boys side won only three of their 19 games, he locked himself in a room at the Conquistador hotel before an away game in Santa Fé and undertook what was essentially a 48-hour audit of how he believed the game should be played.During it he rang his wife, Laura. Their daughter had recently survived critical illness. In that context, he acknowledged, it made no sense to feel as bad as he did about losing football matches – and yet he did. That thoroughness of self-assessment is characteristic of Bielsa. He does not just feel he analyses the feeling.That perhaps explains his curious circumlocutory way of speaking, as though each sentence must interrogate itself before it reaches its conclusion.That was what was most striking about the Spygate furore. It would have been very easy for him to laugh off the sanctimony of the reaction to him sending a coach to stand on public land with a pair of binoculars to investigate the vital secrets of Derby’s tactics, but he did not. Instead he conducted a self-excoriating two-hour press conference in which he not only apologised for failing to understand this might be an issue but demonstrated the level of detail of his research – and then acknowledged it probably didn’t make a difference. He bothered with the work only because, if he didn’t do it, he would feel guilty.Others may speak blithely of philosophies, of having a faith that means they can do no other, yet Bielsa is wholly aware that there is an absurdity to what he does. He is honest, at times almost pathologically so. That is one of the things that makes him such an appealing and inspirational figure. There is no fluff, no cant, no spin.Yet that raises another oddity, which is that, given his level of self-analysis, he must be acutely aware of the tendency of his teams to blow up in the final weeks of a season. That does not necessarily mean simply that they can no longer run as far: as Juan Manuel Llop, who played for him at Newell’s, has observed, Bielsa’s methods also leave his players mentally and emotionally exhausted.And yet, nearly 30 years after the problem first arose, Bielsa has proved unwilling or unable to correct it. It is as though the intensity is so vital to him or his way of playing that it has proved impossible to temper. And when it produces football as viscerally stirring as the five minutes of relentless pressure that led to the equaliser against Preston, who is going to complain?They may have won only one of their last five matches, but then the Christmas glut will always be testing for a Bielsa side. More significant is that gap to third, and the fact they have played West Brom twice.Leeds surely are on the verge of a return to the Premier League. And even if there is a collapse, Bielsa has restored to the club a sense of life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/145e2056586c63ac20f120ec12b23e2b9951a70f/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd5e58975563e5c54bc32b6180cf63c4","title":"liberia palm oil miracle farmers empty promises","story":"Palm plantations are fuelling a booming international trade but the people who live on its edges feel forgotten The sign at the entrance to the palm oil plantation in Grand Bassa has faded thanks to Liberia’s relentless cycle of scorching sun and torrential rain. Even so, it’s possible to make out the phrase: “Your community is rich: Let’s have a fair share.”Several miles farther on, past endless rows of carefully cultivated palm trees, it’s a slogan that bears little relation to reality. Gbenee Town is a small huddle of huts surrounded by a plantation more than six times the size of London’s Richmond Park.The townspeople say that the benefits of the plantation’s expansion have passed them by and they have been duped by a government that took the land they were living off and gave it to foreign investors.“The level we’re living here is very deplorable,” says G Hilary Gbah, one of the town’s elders. “We are starving to death.”Gbah, 54, remembers the arrival in 2012 of Equatorial Palm Oil, the London-headquartered company that owns the plantation. “We embraced the company because we wanted development,” he says, remembering the promises of schools and clinics if local people gave up land.“We were expecting education for our children, employment, healthcare.”He still has a dog-eared list distributed by Liberia’s government. It promised huge rewards if farmers agreed to the clearance of their land, at fixed amounts per plant for crops such as rubber and cassava. “They came and encouraged us … that if we gave them the land then they were going to develop it, all the crops that we had on the land they were going to pay good prices.” People talk of receiving $100 or less for the clearance of crops that could have sustained them for life. The clinics and schools never materialised. One local expert on community compensation, who asked not to be named, said the prices – promised by the government rather than the company – were always wildly unrealistic.But those in nearby communities such as Blayah Town say they had no reason to doubt what they had been told. “They only fooled us and took our land,” says Gbah.Now farmers who once grew their own crops rely on charity or the offer of work from friends in neighbouring towns.The palm oil industry, meanwhile, is thriving. Oil milled from palm fruit is something of a miracle product that has become indispensable to billions of consumers around the world, spawning $60bn industry that continues to grow. Palm oil is found in everything from chocolate to bread, cereal and shampoo. It keeps crisps crispy and stops ice-cream from melting. There is a global process designed to promote ethics in the industry – the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – but it has limited power to effect change.Around the world palm oil continues to play a significant role in deforestation, threatening wildlife and fuelling the climate crisis. In rural Liberia, one of the world’s poorest countries, the immediate concern is the impact that the industry’s appetite for land is having on the people who live here.For many people in Gbenee and nearby towns, land is the only thing of value that they have. Those who have given up their land, even after compensation offers were drastically reduced, say they did so for one reason alone: fear.In communities from Blayah Town to Qwarkpojlian and Paye Town, elders and women’s representatives recount a similar story.When EPO arrived in 2012 to survey the land it had been awarded by the government, local people concerned that they had not been consulted gathered to protest. The company’s representatives were accompanied by an armed police unit, a terrifying sight in a country still recovering from civil wars that left hundreds of thousands dead.“Since the war finished in Liberia, that was the first day to see arms,” said Garamondeh Banwun. “We were afraid.” Banwun, like many people here, reports beatings handed out by police, some of whom – it is claimed – rode in EPO vehicles.The company is keen to expand further in Grand Bassa but communities that were once open to development no longer trust the process to improve their lives. The alleged role of Liberia’s underesourced state in this dynamic is crucial.But the companies involved are struggling to develop in a way that benefits those whose ancestral land has been sold from beneath them.Historically, few of these communities have been included in the proper consultation process that advocacy groups refer to as free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). James Otto represents the Sustainable Development Institute (SDI), a non-governmental organisation based in Liberia’s capital Monrovia with strong ties to palm oil communities.“Companies continue to knowingly rob communities of their land and forest resources to their disadvantage – posing serious threats to their livelihoods and living spaces,” says Otto.SDI wants communities to be properly consulted over the benefits they will receive – such as schools, clinics and employment – and is calling for signed memorandums of understanding. “Consistent failure of oil palm companies including EPO to fulfil their social and environmental commitments continues to weaken the trust of communities and has dented the opportunities of communities for development,” he says.“Financiers of oil palm companies should ensure that the companies are in compliance with FPIC, respect labour rights and environmental standards.”EPO, however, is not certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. SDI and the communities in Grand Bassa are not inherently opposed to the palm industry, which has the power to create jobs and help develop infrastructure. And there has been at least some progress in ensuring that communities have more robust powers to protect themselves.The Land Rights Act, which was passed last year, is key to that effort. It gives communities ownership of ancestral lands, allowing them to make demands of firms that want to exploit it. But it does not apply retroactively and, in a country with limited state presence, there are lingering doubts about whether it leads to the desired outcomes.In some cases, the new law is having unintended consequences. A hundred miles south-east of Grand Bassa, down a mud-bath of a road lined with the rusting hulks of broken-down cars and trucks – lies the town of Shampee in Sinoe County. Here, EPO did bring benefits: employment and much-needed schools and clinics, staffed by teachers and nurses paid by the company.But a protracted land dispute between neighbouring communities has deterred the company from further investment. Earlier this year it announced plans to pull out.Like many of the staff in the clinic and school, midwife Caroline Weah was a contractor. She has worked in the company’s clinic for six years but has limited redundancy rights. What’s more, she says the company began slowing supplies to the clinic months ago.“They usually gave us drugs every quarter,” she says. “From July we don’t have medicine so the patient load starts going down. Right now, no medicine. Somebody come, If I assess what they need, I don’t have it. I give them prescription and they’re not able to afford to buy.”“What will become of the pregnant women and the children?”EPO’s departure appears to have hit Shampee as hard as its arrival in Gbenee.Such cases have convinced SDI that Liberia would be better off with smaller community-run plantations that could supply multinational firms’ thirst for palm oil and put the wealth into the community. This model, says Otto, is the “only hope for prosperity and development that recognises rights and protects the environment”.Traidcraft Exchange, a UK-based campaign group, wants to see pressure applied through legal safeguards in markets such as the UK where demand for palm oil is created. “Things would have been very different if EPO had been required to consider the impact of these big land deals on local people,” said senior policy adviser Tom Wills. “That’s why Traidcraft Exchange and others are calling for new legislation that would make UK companies assess what risks they pose to human rights, and hold them to account in the courts for any abuses.”Equatorial Palm Oil is listed on London’s Alternative Investment Market (Aim). Its ultimate majority owner is Malaysian firm Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad.EPO declined to comment on the record. However, the company indicated that allegations about its role in violence by state police dated from some time ago. It also said it had been working hard to build consensus with local communities and indicated that the Liberian government had agreed to assume responsibility for the clinic in Shampee."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e60e5e5886a7f8b0c8cbbd0d864446b25840907/0_283_5467_3280/master/5467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a5a676cb793cf538640f5df5ce4e31f","title":"empty promises marie kondo craze for minimalism","story":"From the ‘KonMari method’ to Apple’s barely-there design philosophy, we are forever being urged to declutter and simplify our lives. But does minimalism really make us any happier? By  Kyle ChaykaSonrisa Andersen’s childhood home was a mess. Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother’s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen’s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.Andersen wanted all the things she had lacked in childhood, the comforts her colleagues and neighbours enjoyed. She wanted to be like the people in adverts, with their immaculate stage-set living rooms. Each new purchase brought a small dopamine rush that faded as soon as the thing was out of its box and taking up space. As she began to acquire more and more stuff and more and more debt, she began to feel as if she was falling into the pattern set by her mother.She went online for a solution. The search turned up blogs about “minimalism”: a lifestyle of living with less and being happy with, and more aware of, what you already own. The minimalist bloggers were men and women who, like her, had an epiphany that came from a personal crisis of consumerism. Buying more had failed to make them happier. In fact, it was entrapping them, and they needed to find a new relationship with their possessions – usually by throwing most of them out. After jettisoning as much as they possibly could, the bloggers showed off their emptied apartments and shared the strategies they used to own no more than 100 objects. The advice gained them large followings and they began soliciting donations or selling books. Presiding over them was Marie Kondo, a Japanese cleaning guru whose books were becoming international bestsellers. The principal commandment of Kondoism was to abandon anything that didn’t “spark joy” – a phrase that soon became familiar around the world.What the bloggers collectively called minimalism amounted to a kind of enlightened simplicity, a moral message combined with a particularly austere visual style. This style was displayed primarily on Instagram and Pinterest. Certain hallmarks of minimalist imagery emerged: clean white subway tiles, furniture in the style of Scandinavian midcentury modern, and clothing made of organic fabrics from brands that promised you would only ever need to buy one of each piece. Next to the products were monochromatic memes with slogans such as “Own less stuff. Find more purpose.” The trend wasn’t as subtle as its name suggested minimalism was a brand to identify with as much as a way of coping with mess.Andersen bought the minimalist books and listened to the podcasts. She removed everything from the walls of her home, cleared every surface and installed furniture made of light pinewood so that the rooms glowed in the sun. Without buying new stuff, the couple had enough money to pay off their bills and Shane’s student loans. Andersen felt a weight being released that went beyond the absence of clutter. She felt consumerism’s spell over her had been broken. “You don’t have to want things,” she said. “It’s a meditative thing, almost like repeating a mantra.”I met Andersen in 2017 in Cincinnati, where we were both attending a lecture on minimalism held at a local concert venue. We had come to see a pair of ebullient bloggers named Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, who started calling themselves the Minimalists in 2010. Both had enjoyed six-figure salaries in technology marketing, but amid mounting debt and addiction problems, they hit the reset button, turning to blogging instead – blogging about how they got rid of everything and started over. The Minimalists self-published books and accrued millions of podcast listeners. In 2016, their documentary about minimalist practices across the country was picked up by Netflix. Most of the fans I talked to in Cincinnati cited the film as their conversion moment to minimalism.I had been tracking the rise of this minimalist movement and the style that it produced for a few years, but its momentum still surprised me. It was a new social attitude that took its name from what was originally an avant-garde art movement that started in 1960s New York. How could that have happened? Minimalism in the context of visual art was not particularly mainstream (certainly not on the level of Andy Warhol’s pop art) nor even well understood, all of 50 years later, and yet it was also a viral hashtag. There in Cincinnati were suburban commuters and retirees discussing how they had embraced minimalism. Millburn and Nicodemus told me that they had found fans as far away as India and Japan.Over the following two years, minimalism kept popping up around me – in new hotel designs, fashion brands and self-help books. “Digital minimalism” became a term for avoiding the overwhelming information deluge of the internet and trying to not check your phone as much. But when I caught up with Andersen, I learned that she had left her local minimalism Facebook group and stopped listening to the Minimalists’ podcast every week. It wasn’t that she didn’t believe in minimalism any more. It had just become an integral part of her life, the basis for her entire approach to the stuff around her. She noticed it was sometimes more trendy than practical: there were people who liked talking about minimalism more than actually minimising, she said.On one hand there was the facade of minimalism: its brand and visual appearance. On the other was the unhappiness at the root of it all, caused by a society that tells you more is always better. Every advertisement for a new thing implied that you should dislike what you already had. It took Andersen a long time to understand the lesson: “There was really nothing wrong with our lives at all.”In the 21st century, across the developed world, most of us do not need as much as we have. The average American household possesses more than 300,000 items. In the UK, one study found that children have on average 238 toys, but only play with 12 of them on a daily basis. We are addicted to accumulation. The minimalist lifestyle seems like a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism, accelerating since the industrial revolution, is literally destroying the planet.Yet my gut reaction to Kondo and the Minimalists was that it all seemed a little too convenient: just sort through your house or listen to a podcast, and happiness, satisfaction and peace of mind could all be yours. It was a blanket solution so vague that it could be applied to anyone and anything. You could use the Kondo method for your closet, your Facebook account or your boyfriend. Minimalism also seemed sometimes to be a form of inidualism, an excuse to put yourself first by thinking, I shouldn’t have to deal with this person, place or thing because it doesn’t fit within my worldview. On an economic level, it was a commandment to live safely within your means versus pursuing dreamy aspirations or taking a leap of faith – not a particularly inspiring doctrine.Minimalism, I came to think, is not necessarily a voluntary personal choice, but an inevitable societal and cultural shift responding to the experience of living through the 2000s. Up through the 20th century, material accumulation and stability made sense as forms of security. If you owned your home and your land, no one could take it away from you. If you stuck with one company throughout your career, it was insurance against periods of future economic instability, when you hoped your employer would protect you.Little of this feels true today. The percentage of workers who are freelance instead of salaried grows each year. House prices are prohibitive in any place with a strong labour market. Economic inequality is more severe than ever in the modern era. To make matters even worse, the greatest wealth now comes from the accumulation of invisible capital, not physical stuff: startup equity, stock shares and offshore bank accounts opened to avoid taxes. As the French economist Thomas Piketty points out, these immaterial possessions grow in value much faster than salaries do. That is, if you are lucky enough to have a salary in the first place. Meanwhile, crisis follows crisis and mobility now feels safer than being static, another reason that owning less looks more and more attractive.Most of all, the minimalist attitude speaks to the feeling that all aspects of life have become relentlessly commodified. Buying unnecessary items on Amazon with credit cards is a fast and easy way to exert some feeling of control over our precarious surroundings. Brands sell us cars, televisions, smartphones and other products (often on loans that inflate their costs) as if they will solve our problems. Through books, podcasts and designed objects, the idea of minimalism itself has also been commodified.If I am a minimalist, then, it is by default. In the New York apartment where I lived while writing this, I could look around and count the objects that belonged to me. Not the couch, bed, TV, console or dining table, which came from my one roommate. Just a desk and a bookshelf that held most of the things I cared about: books, papers and a few pieces of art. Unless you are wealthy or creative enough to afford a lot of space, there are two responses to living in New York: one is overstuffing a tiny space that eventually becomes unbearable, the other is living like a minimalist. Without basements, spare closets or extra rooms to stash stuff in, you are always Kondoing.The great recession of 2008 also seemed to usher in a larger minimalist moment. An aesthetic of necessity emerged as the economy came to a standstill. Shopping at thrift stores became cool. So did a certain style of rustic simplicity. Brooklyn and Shoreditch were filled with faux-lumberjacks drinking out of mason jars. Conspicuous consumption, the ostentation of the previous decades, was not just distasteful, it was unreachable. This faux blue-collar hipsterism preceded the turn to high-gloss consumer minimalism that happened once the economic recovery kicked in, preparing the ground for its popularity.Dissatisfaction with materialism and the usual rewards of society is not new, but minimalism is not an idea with a straightforward chronological history. It is more like a feeling that repeats in different times and places around the world. It is defined by the sense that the surrounding civilisation is excessive, and has thus lost some kind of original authenticity, which must be regained. The material world holds less meaning in these moments, and so accumulating more stuff loses its appeal.I began thinking of this universal feeling as the longing for less. It is an abstract, almost nostalgic desire – a pull toward a different, simpler world. Not past or future, neither utopian nor dystopian, this more authentic world is always just beyond our current existence, in a place we can never quite reach. Perhaps the longing for less is the constant shadow of humanity’s self-doubt: what if we were better off without everything we have gained in modern society? If the trappings of civilisation leave us so dissatisfied, then maybe their absence is preferable and we should abandon them in order to seek some deeper truth. The longing for less is neither an illness nor a cure. Minimalism is just one way of thinking about what makes a good life.For some of its devotees, minimalism is therapy. The spasm of getting rid of everything is like an exorcism of the past, clearing the way for a new future of pristine simplicity. It represents a decisive break. No longer will we depend on the accumulation of stuff to bring us happiness – we will instead be content with the things we have consciously decided to keep, the things that represent our ideal selves. By owning fewer things, we might be able to construct new identities through selective curation instead of succumbing to consumerism.At least, that is the model popularized by Marie Kondo’s books, social media accounts and the instantly famous Netflix series that launched at the beginning of 2019. The KonMari Method, described in Kondo’s English-language debut The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, is curiously rigid, with a ritualistic appeal from the process of handling each item in turn and deciding if it stays or goes. Only by following Kondo’s disciplined tenets can the reader be fully successful. Despite her claims that everyone should find their own version of tidiness, she critiques those who follow “erroneous conventional approaches” to cleaning. One must begin with clothes, then proceed on to books, papers and household miscellany. Sentimental items such as photographs or memorabilia are last, because only by the end will you have built up the appropriate sensitivity to joy being sparked to evaluate such potent objects.Kondo promises the illusion of choice. You decide what stays in your house, but she tells you exactly how it should be folded, stored and displayed – in other words, how you should relate to it. When you pull everything out of its nooks and crannies, you realise just how much stuff you own, and how much of it you do not really need. It is like learning what actually goes into junk food: being forced to think about what you put into your life is enough to instill the habit for ever. Kondo boasts that none of her clients has ever relapsed. “A dramatic reorganisation of the home causes correspondingly dramatic changes in lifestyle and perspective,” she writes. Readers trade the orthodoxy of consumerism for the orthodoxy of tidiness. KonMari might be vaguely anti-capitalist, but then there is the fact that you have to buy a suite of Kondo books to practise it. She has been fully transformed into a brand: her company now sells luxury Kondo boxes to organise your stuff in, certification classes for would-be Kondo acolytes and a range of crystals, as well as a “therapeutic tuning fork”.Minimalism was already being commodified when Kondo emerged, however. She was only the crest of a larger 2010s wave of writers adopting the idea. Her English-language predecessors emerged out of the online lifestyle-blogger community, with blogs such as Joshua Becker’s Becoming Minimalist, starting in 2008 Courtney Carver’s Be More With Less, in 2010, and The Minimalists, who had already self-published their book Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life in 2011.The literature of the minimalist lifestyle is an exercise in banality. It is saccharine and predigested, presented as self-help as much as a practical how-to guide. Each book contains an easy structure of epiphany and aftermath, recounting the crisis that leads its author to minimalism, the minimalist metamorphosis and then the positive ways the author’s life changed. The books are often broken up into subheadings, and important phrases are bolded like a high-school textbook. Each one offers more or less the same vision as the others: “I don’t need to own all this stuff,” as Becker writes. Minimalism’s rewards are more money, more generosity, more freedom, less stress, less distraction, less environmental impact, higher-quality belongings and more contentment, as Becker reels off in a series of bullet points. The books’ sameness of content is matched by a shared design of visual serenity. Their covers are all soft colours and soothing typefaces, suitable for Instagramming – even if you don’t read them, they can still be inspiring. The serene covers of these books are just one example of how minimalism’s visual appeal makes its doctrine of sacrifice easier to swallow. Its aesthetic of fashionable austerity is like a brand logo. It is identifiable anywhere, and serves to remind us of the air of moral purity associated with simplicity, even if the minimalist product to be consumed has no moral content whatsoever.The KonMari Method and minimalist self-help as a whole works because it is a simple, almost one-step procedure, as memorable as a marketing slogan. It is a shock treatment demonstrating that you do not need to depend on possessions for an identity you still exist even when they are gone. But as Kondo conceives it, it is also a one-size-fits-all process that has a way of homogenising homes and erasing traces of personality or quirkiness, like the sprawling collection of Christmas decorations that one woman on the Netflix show was forced to decimate over the course of an episode. The overflow of nutcrackers and tinsel was a clear problem (as was her husband’s piles of baseball cards), but with their absence the home was sanitised and homogenised. Minimalist cleanliness is the state of acceptable normalcy that everyone must adhere to, no matter how boring it looks.The most famous proponent of minimalism – or at least minimalism as a lifehack – was probably Steve Jobs. In a famous photograph from 1982, Jobs sits on the floor of his living room. He was in his late 20s at the time, and Apple was making $1bn a year. He had just bought a large house in Los Gatos, California, but he kept it totally empty. In Diana Walker’s photo, he is seen cross-legged on a single square of carpet, holding a mug, wearing a simple dark sweater and jeans – his prototypical uniform. A tall lamp by his side casts a perfect circle of light. “This was a very typical time,” Jobs later remembered. “All you needed was a cup of tea, a light and your stereo, you know, and that’s what I had.” Not for him, the usual displays of wealth or status. In the photo he looks content.Yet the image of simplicity is deceptive. The house Jobs bought was huge for a young, single man with no use for that excess space. Wired magazine later discovered that the stereo setup resting in the corner would have cost $8,200. The lone lamp that illuminates the scene was made by Tiffany. It was a valuable antique, not a utilitarian tool.Not only is simplicity often less simple than it looks, it can also be much less practical than it seems. People often conflate the phrase “form follows function” – the idea that the external appearance of an object or building should reflect the way that it works – with the self-conscious appearance of minimalism, as in Jobs’s house or the design of Apple’s iPhone. But Jobs’s empty living room was not particularly usable. Instead of the mantra that “form follows function”, Jobs echoes a slogan that could be glimpsed not long ago in one upscale New York shop front: “Fewer, better.” Possess the best things and only the best things, if only you can afford them. It was better to go without a couch than buy one that wasn’t perfect. That commitment to taste might be rarified, but it probably did not endear Jobs to his family, who might have preferred a place to sit.Apple devices have gradually simplified in appearance over time under designer Jony Ive, who joined the company in 1992, which is why they are so synonymous with minimalism. By 2002, the Apple desktop computer had evolved into a thin, flat screen mounted on an arm connected to a rounded base. Then, into the 2010s, the screen flattened even more and the base vanished until all that was left were two intersecting lines, one with a right angle for the base and another, straight, for the screen. It sometimes seems, as our machines become infinitely thinner and wider, that we will eventually control them by thought alone, because touch would be too dirty, too analogue.Does this all really constitute simplicity? Apple devices have only a few visual qualities. But it is also an illusion of efficiency. The company strives to make its phones thinner and removes ports – see headphone jacks – any chance it gets. The iPhone’s function depends on an enormous, complex, ugly superstructure of satellites and undersea cables that certainly are not designed in pristine whiteness. Minimalist design encourages us to forget everything a product relies on and imagine, in this case, that the internet consists of carefully shaped glass and steel alone.The contrast between simple form and complex consequences brings to mind what the British writer Daisy Hildyard called “the second body” in her 2017 book of the same name. The phrase describes the alienated presence that we feel when we are aware of both our inidual physical bodies and our collective causation of environmental damage and climate change. While we calmly walk down the street, watch a film or go food shopping, we are also the source of pollution drifting across the Pacific or a tsunami in Indonesia. The second body is the source of an unplaceable anxiety: the problems are undeniably our fault, even though it feels as if we cannot do anything about them because of the sheer difference in scale.Similarly, we might be able to hold the iPhone in our hands, but we should also be aware that the network of its consequences is vast: server farms absorbing massive amounts of electricity, Chinese factories where workers die by suicide, devastated mud pit mines that produce tin. It is easy to feel like a minimalist when you can order food, summon a car or rent a room using a single brick of steel and silicon. But in reality, it is the opposite. We are taking advantage of a maximalist assemblage. Just because something looks simple does not mean it is the aesthetics of simplicity cloak artifice, or even unsustainable excess.This slickness is part of minimalism’s marketing pitch. According to one survey in a magazine called Minimalissimo, you can now buy minimalist coffee tables, water carafes, headphones, sneakers, wristwatches, speakers, scissors and bookends, each in the same monochromatic, severe style familiar from Instagram, and often with pricetags in the hundreds, if not thousands. What they all seem to offer is a kind of mythical just-rightness, the promise that if you just consume this one perfect thing, then you won’t need to buy anything else in the future – at least until the old thing is upgraded and some new level of possible perfection is found.Adapted from The Longing for Less: Living with Minimalism by Kyle Chayka, which will be published by Bloomsbury on 21 January• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05330d550c436fe1913e8c7ed53bc9923268c213/0_110_5812_3486/master/5812.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2264ea7c151c0148fc119aa91d4fd4f6","title":"romesh ranganathan quinoa pants year living healthily","story":"Last January Romesh Ranganathan decided he wanted to get fitter and feel better. Could he stick to his plan?It has long been a source of amusement to my friends that I have maintained such a hefty bulk despite my veganism. It is true: I have taken being vegan as a sign that I shouldn’t deprive myself any further, and am guilty of gravitating towards the junk food end of the plant-based spectrum. I once ate four huge filled doughnuts in one sitting on the basis that vegans rarely get nice doughnuts, and “they were probably made of kale or something”.A year ago, I decided something had to be done. My father died of a heart attack, and my body shape ticked all the boxes of someone headed the same way. There was another issue. My dissatisfaction with the way I look means I tend to wear one or two more layers of clothing than the season dictates. I can often be found at a bar sweating profusely, which, besides preferring the Crawley Pizza Express to the Woking branch, is another degree of separation I am proud to have from Prince Andrew.I have had issues with my body all my life. I was a fat child and only lost weight during my A-levels, enjoying a three-year stint of being “skinny”. This generated a sense of euphoria similar to how Chesney Hawkes must have felt for the three years that followed the release The One And Only. I then piled it all back on at university. The girl I was seeing at the time found my weight gain fairly unappealing, leading to a campaign by her and her friends to “hint” me into losing it. All this has left me with an ongoing hangup about my physique. I remember the first time I took my top off on television. When the show aired, somebody tweeted to complain that as a result of watching me she had been unable to finish her dinner. I assume she didn’t mean because she was so sexually aroused.Last year, I decided to set myself a goal, one that involved a very simple metric: a Wu-Tang Clan T-shirt I had bought online from the US. When it arrived, I realised that it looked so ridiculous that wearing it might lead to a cease-and-desist order from the group for fear that my doughy body squeezed into their merch could damage the brand. I decided that my goal was to be able to wear that T-shirt in public without feeling ashamed. I was not even allowed to do the bigger-man trick of wearing it under an open shirt.I have, of course, tried to lose weight many times, and succeeded – only to put it straight back on. I wanted this to be different, so I resolved to make changes that would be sustainable. I have done 1,200-calorie days and hit the gym hard, and you get results quickly but I also quickly feel miserable (for me, usually around day two). I fall off the wagon badly, before eating the wagon in its entirety. This time I accepted that some of the things I was going to try would fail. I had to: based on the evidence of the past, everything would fail.First I decided to get a personal trainer. Although expensive compared with going to the gym alone, it was necessary because my levels of self-discipline are pathetically low. For example: only six paragraphs into this article, I have stopped for an hour to watch the second half of Jurassic World on TV. When the film ended with a mesosaur emerging from the water to chow down on the lab-created Indominus rex, it made want to have a large snack, which I went off and did. In the same way, when I go to the gym, I can often be found doing three reps of something before looking at my phone, messing with the settings on my headphones, and then trapping someone in conversation by a treadmill until they ask to be left alone.A personal trainer forces you to use all the strange equipment that you would otherwise avoid. My local gym is filled with people I consider experts, who do those weird exercises that you see in Rocky montages, flailing ropes and standing on one leg while you throw a large sack at the ground repeatedly, before pushing a sled up and down the gym like a ’roided husky.My own trainer, David, is an Adonis. He once posted a photograph on Facebook to show how badly he had let himself go over Christmas: it was such an incredible example of the human physique that I nearly saved it as my wallpaper. Rather than doing an exercise and then looking at my phone for 10 minutes, David had me exercising continually. We would move from one station to the next, me sweating even more than a fat man wearing too many layers of clothing in the summer. I also had the blessing or misfortune of not feeling comfortable enough with David to tell him I was dying, which meant that I would often be in the middle of a set and David would tell me to take a break because it’s not normal to be crying.To avoid messing up a busy day, I had to do the sessions early in the morning, often meeting David at 6am. Any later would have meant not taking my kids to school, which I don’t get the chance to do as much as I’d like. It seemed counterintuitive: I was exercising so I could be around longer for my kids, but I was doing it during the time that I could have been spending with them now.I would go to bed late after work, panicked about having to get up in four hours, then lie in bed fully awake until it was time for the personal-training session. I would go and exercise, feel great about what I had achieved for the next hour, and then spend the rest of the day feeling shattered. The breaking point was when I realised that I could cancel at the last minute, as long as I paid for the session. I was soon paying a lot of money to wake up and text a man to say that I wasn’t going to be able to see him, before going back to sleep.I tried a couple of other things. I started going to the gym on my own I tried to run I did boxing training. Running was boring I spent most of my gym time downloading albums on to my phone and one day after boxing I threw up round the side of the house and felt so ill I was late for work. It wasn’t exactly a sustainable way to keep fit, especially as there is only a finite number of things to keep being shit at.Then I discovered my saviour: a spin bike with a screen that lets you do classes online. That doesn’t sound particularly enticing to a sloth, but it was perfect. I could do high-intensity classes, and all I had to do was go downstairs. You get little electronic badges for keeping up a streak, and a T-shirt when you complete 100 classes. There was an accompanying Facebook group full of people who post photos of themselves after a ride saying things like, “Go, team!”I felt pretty weird about doing something so culty, even before the creepy Peloton Christmas ad that looked a lot like a sequel to Get Out. It is also supremely expensive, with a huge outlay on the bike, plus a gym membership-sized subscription – so much so that my wife and I had a meeting to discuss whether it was worth it, based on my predilection for abandoning everything. I found the conversation so unfair that I went and made a smoothie with the NutriBullet, which I eventually found behind my Slendertone Ab Tuning belt. However, the spin bike is the one form of exercise that has stuck. It is difficult to find an excuse not to exercise in your own house (plus my wife has threatened to leave me if I stop using it).Diet was the next thing. I tried to take all of the decision-making out of my hands by having pre-prepared meals delivered. I would eat only three meals a day, plus water, and know exactly what my nutritional intake was. The food sounded very cool: dishes such as Sichuan tofu with spicy pak choi. It was tasty and convenient, but seemed like something a professional athlete would do rather than someone who occasionally uses an exercise bike. Also, it was a bit weird to rule yourself out of every social occasion that involved eating because you were living out of Tupperware boxes. But the main stumbling block, again, is that it is prohibitively expensive – exorbitant enough for my wife to start calling me Jay-Z.In the end, I settled on intermittent fasting. I am going to hold my hands up here: I don’t understand the science behind it. You select eight hours of the day when you can eat, and fast for the other 16, sticking to zero-calorie drinks such as water or black coffee. After 12 hours of not eating, your body apparently goes into a state in which it’s eating itself, or something. I don’t know. What I do know is that I definitely benefited from reducing the number of hours in which I was allowed to take in calories. You can also, if you fancy, only do it six days a week and have a cheat day, although I made the mistake of deciding ad hoc when my cheat day was going to be, before eventually realising I had had seven cheat days out of the last 10. I knocked cheat days on the head.I would love to tell you that the rest of the year was spent smashing out class after class, as I intermittently fasted my way to a set of chiselled abs and being sexy AF, but life got in the way. In August I had to go on tour, which threw everything up in the air.I hate having food in my system when I’m on stage. This means I don’t feel comfortable eating anything after about 5pm, if I’m due on at 8pm. While this is great for minimising calories in the afternoon, I often finish my show contemplating eating a member of the audience. As everyone knows, no good nutritional decisions are made at 10pm. I would often end up going for a curry, so hungry that I would eat 1,000 poppadoms before the actual food arrived.I attempted to stock my hotel room with healthy choices for after the show. However, I was struck by the bleakness of eating a quinoa salad at 11pm in my underwear. I suppose it is possible to put on some clothes, but I made a vow many years ago that I would only ever eat in a hotel room in my underwear and I would hate to break that streak.I came up with a compromise. I decided to push myself to eat a little bit closer to the show, and then nothing afterwards. This was OK as long as I didn’t do anything that made me hungry, like sit at a bar that had snacks, peruse the room service menu, or talk to anyone who had a head shaped like a potato. This meant I had to avoid my tour manager, or King Edward as I started to call him.Staying on top of exercise was also difficult without my spin bike. I have to confess to finding hotel gyms horribly intimate. More often than not, they are like a cupboard with equipment inside. You find yourself in close proximity to a stranger, constantly apologising for going to pick up the same piece of equipment. On one occasion, another man seemed to be doing a circuit that involved every piece of equipment in a random order. I had to gamble and go for the thing I hoped he might not be using next. It was only after about 45 minutes of this that I realised he was probably thinking the exact same thing.I needed a strategy that meant I could avoid a hotel gym and, of course, something that worked in hotels that didn’t have one. I searched online and, as it turns out, hotel room workouts are in high demand. After a little more searching, I found myself doing a set of chest presses with my suitcase. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, but you do feel a bit of pride at having made the best of a bad situation. And by bad situation, I mean having such a bounty of nutrition in your life that you have to find ways to burn it off when you’re slightly too shy to use the on-site gym at your luxury hotel.If I am giving the impression that I have worked relentlessly at getting my weight down, please be reassured: I have lost a bit of weight, but spent more time feeling guilty about doing nothing than making progress. Weeks have gone by where I was too knackered to do anything once, I felt so sorry for myself that I ordered a vegan sticky toffee pudding to my room at 2am and ate it in the dark. And then went to sleep. And then woke up and found I had toffee on my chest. And then ate that toffee.But I have become much more conscious of my choices. When I make bad ones, I try to make some good ones for a while. I no longer see eating sticky toffee pudding at 2am as a terrible failure it just means I need to balance that afterwards. I am by no means an exercise beast, but I do try to look for opportunities to work out when I can. Before, I would have described myself as “sedentary with occasional flurries of exertion”. I have also stopped thinking about it as “falling off the wagon” it’s just an ongoing thing that you do your best at, and then try to describe in a  column without sounding like Carrie Bradshaw in Sex And The City.And without being too corny, I have become more invested in the process because it gets results: I am trying to stay healthy because it feels good because eating better makes me better at work and because exercise is good for my mental health. I use these things to help me get over the fact that there is still no way I am ready to wear that Wu-Tang T-shirt yet.I think the thing I am most grateful for, however, is pushing my belly out so excessively in the “before” photos (page 12) that it looks as if I’ve made huge changes. I tend to think of it more a gear change.These exercises can be done anywhere – all you need is a small space and a chair. They should be done in a circuit. Spend 30 seconds on each one, and then have 30 seconds rest. Repeat five times, making sure everything is done in a controlled way with a straight back and engaged core.With your feet shoulder-width apart and your back straight, squat low towards the ground and back up again.Start in a plank position and lower your body towards the ground by bending your arms. Then, straighten your arms, pushing yourself back up into the plank.Make sure you lift your knees as high as you can, and pump your arms as fast as possible. Do this for 30 seconds, keeping your back straight.Start with your feet together. Take one leg back, bend your knees and do a reverse lunge. Then straighten your back leg and stand up, putting your feet back together. Alternate between the right and left leg.With your back to a chair, move your hands behind you so you are holding the top of it and lower your body towards the ground by bending your elbows. Then push yourself back up again by using your triceps – the large muscles on the back of the arms. Repeat this exercise slowly for 30 seconds.

One might imagine it is by now, for the ghost has truly flown, and left a flurry of needles on your floor. Still, let us not waste this moment to honour the tree’s life with a good bit of recycling.If I am honest, I don’t have a tree to recycle because I am not a fan of the Christmas tree tradition. So mostly I have to steal other people’s trees. I go around collecting up the corpses left out with the bins (clearly not the ones destined for the council recycling scheme) and take them back to my allotment.The needles of fir trees make excellent ericaceous compost, perfect for pleasing blueberries, cranberries, bilberries, heathers and azaleas. Depending on your tree, this might be as simple as sweeping up the fallen needles from the sitting room. If you have a fancy tree that’s been bred to never let go, snip off the branches from the main trunk. If you have access to a garden shredder this will speed things up no end. Otherwise chop by hand into smaller pieces, then scatter around the base of your ericaceous plants and let nature do her thing. You can also use the evergreen branches as frost protection they are excellent for protecting perennial crowns.However, you may have nothing left other than bare twiggy stems and the trunk. The timber of fir trees takes an inordinate time to rot back all those lovely-smelling natural oils in the wood are there in part to protect the tree from rotting. So, if you are going to add them to the compost, use them at the bottom of a new pile. A good compost pile is not dissimilar to building a good fire: you want airflow at the base to speed things up. A layer of slow-rotting branches will do just that.Alternatively, the branches make excellent supports for dwarf peas or broad beans. What to do with the remaining trunk? It could be used as an upright in a dead hedge. This sort of hedge comprises all the woody stems too tough or big for compost – raspberry canes, woody branches, that sort of thing – that are then stacked and left to very slowly rot. While they are doing this, they make a wonderful insect and wildlife habitat. The whole thing can get rather messy, but if you stagger upright posts either side of the hedge you can then lay the branches neatly inside.

But employers warn that the decline in teenage part-time work is leaving many unprepared for the realities of working life.“This lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground,” said Laura Gardiner, the Resolution Foundation’s research director.Many of the UK’s most successful people have spoken publicly about their Saturday jobs the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, toiled on a building site, the entrepreneur Karen Brady worked in a hair salon and the broadcaster Robert Peston cleaned freezers in a frozen food shop. The jobs that 16- and 17-year-olds are most likely to undertake include waiting tables, helping in restaurant and hotel kitchens and working as shop assistants.“School leavers and university graduates coming into the workplace too often lack key skills like resilience, team working and general awareness of appropriate workplace behaviour,” said Amy Leonard, the chief executive of the Transformation Trust, which helps disadvantaged teenagers get into work. “Particularly with young people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas, it’s not just about developing the right skills, it’s about demystifying the world of work and helping them to develop the confidence to take that next step from education into work.”Almost half of employers believe young people leaving school, college or university are not “work ready”, according to a recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry.The wider rise in the number of people who have never worked means that a third of people who are currently out of work have never been employed, compared to a fifth in the late 1990s.At the same time, more people are working now this apparent paradox is explained by a reduction in the number of unemployed people who have previously worked and an increase in the number who have never worked.This latter trend is driven not by a group of people deciding to live on welfare benefits, the Resolution Foundation said, but by university and college students working less, a longer lag between leaving full-time education and getting paid work and the decline of the teenage Saturday job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/540d9199ea2212424e40e32e4a05a6848a81a52c/0_380_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f94194ff07242176d29d7608bbfe3fd","title":"atp cup britain belgium","story":"These are not normal times in Australia and, as the continent baked, its citizens bruised but unbowed by the sinister swirl of fire and wind, a pale-skinned Englishman embraced a lesser challenge, one that is proving to be a welcome distraction from tragedy.Captaining Great Britain in the new ATP Cup 12,000 miles from his blazered duties at the All England Club was a mission some thought would not appeal to Tim Henman, especially in the 46C heat that hit Sydney like a hammer on an anvil on Saturday afternoon.But, having accepted Andy Murray’s invitation to lead the side in the 24-nation competition, he has done the job with an enthusiasm that has rippled through the squad, even as they lost 2-1 to Bulgaria on Friday. His immediate task is to keep them in the competition by beating Belgium on Sunday in the second of their three round-robin ties.Henman and the team have been as upset as the other hundred-plus players who have gathered in three cities across the sixth largest country in the world, and, as smoke and furnace-level air drifted ominously towards the Olympic tennis centre on western outskirts of the NSW capital, they pledged their support to the many fund-raising initiatives for bushfire relief. Carrying on with business has not been easy for anyone the past few weeks.As a player, Henman, an elegant six-time grand slam semi-finalist, retained faith in his serve-and-volley game, but never delivered fully on his talent. However, after Great Britain went down fighting on day one, you could hear in his voice he also trusted the players’ instincts.He thought they all played well against Grigor Dimitrov’s team, and they did for extended periods. The players – a few of whom don’t know him that well – thought Henman was pretty cool, too. After beating Dimitar Kuzmanov in three sets, Cameron Norrie said: “He’s got some good stories from when he was playing and some good experience.”He surely has. Henman first played here in 1991, winning a junior doubles title with Jamie Delgado, Andy Murray’s coach, and returned for the 2000 Olympics, where he admits he lasted less than an hour. Ups and downs, he knows, are part of the game. As he said of his first mentoring gig: “I have absolutely loved it. I think that’s a reflection on my team, the atmosphere, the way that we’ve prepared, how much fun we’ve had and how well they’ve played.“Sometimes these are bitter pills to swallow when you play some great tennis. It’s such small margins. We had match points in the doubles and it didn’t go our way. I’ve been around long enough to know you’ve got to keep putting yourself in that position and hopefully next time it will go our way.”Norrie thought the court was “extremely slow” but Henman disagreed. “I don’t think the court is particularly slow. I think the ball is heavy and the humidity slows it up. The ball is not flying, so that means you are going to have extended rallies. When you are adding a bit of heat, it’s hard work for the players.”The temperature is forecast to drop to a relatively comfortable mid-30s on Sunday, but Henman says they have few qualms about the conditions when they are playing under the new canopy on the Ken Rosewall Arena.“It’s a reflection of how good the tennis is. We said to Cam before his match, ’It’s the first match of the season, you’re playing someone you don’t know particularly well, let’s get in there and work this guy side to side, stay in the rallies.’“They played four games in 25 minutes. That’s the nature of this sport. The physicality is different, the matches go on longer. That’s the nature of the beast. You’ve got to work hard.” For all his touch and elegance, Henman was never afraid of putting in the hours to prepare for his matches, especially after overcoming a bone condition in his early days.

Fiddlerontheroof, one of three top-notch novices in the Tizzard family’s stable in Dorset, was a thoroughly impressive winner of the first Grade One of 2020 as he shrugged off the heavy ground and pulled six lengths clear of Jeremys Flame, and the only issue now for his trainer and would-be backers is which race he is likely to turn up for at the Cheltenham Festival in March.For the punters who sent Fiddlerontheroof off the 5-4 favourite, the victory was as smooth as they come. The six-year-old needed three attempts to get off the mark over hurdles, over course and distance last month, but the first of those was a close second behind Thyme Hill, a Grade One winner since, and he continues to improve race-by-race.The ground here was deep and holding but Fiddlerontheroof went clear in a few strides between the final two flights and his price for the Supreme Novice Hurdle on 10 March was down from 33-1 to around 12-1 by the time he was unsaddled.“The further the race went, the happier I was,” said Robbie Power, the winning jockey. “He’s travelled stronger the more the race went on, but the most pleasing thing of the whole race was when I gave him a squeeze going to the second last, the turn of foot he showed there was quite impressive. He was able to quicken in that ground when others weren’t, so it was an impressive performance.”Fiddlerontheroof might well be a little shorter for the Supreme were it certain to be his destination in March, but the permutations in the Tizzard stable alone mean that the question will go unanswered for several weeks yet while the going at the Festival could also be crucial.Rex Dingle produced the most adroit ride as Jepeck was forced to negotiate a tricky path to victory in the final of the Veterans’ Chase series.The 3-1 favourite was in front on the run to the last but with a loose horse on his outside, which then ed across towards the inside rail to go around the final fence. Dingle had a split-second to change course and avoid being carried out, a manoeuvre he executed deftly before clearing the fence and securing the £61,900 first prize.Palladium made short work of three opponents – or rather two, after the first-flight departure of Zarafshan – in the opening juvenile hurdle and is quoted at around 33-1 for the Triumph Hurdle, while Nicky Henderson, his trainer, also reports Altior could run at Kempton Park next Saturday for the first time since his 19-race winning streak ended with a defeat at Ascot in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4976b4501d8762f74088a03303f01eedad18a366/37_99_2632_1579/master/2632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=363d82ba0b2f3895425b3da5e05907c2","title":"saracens worcester premiership match report","story":"In his 20-plus years as Saracens chairman, Nigel Wray has presided over wins of more significance than this, but if the urgency of his charges’ performance is any gauge they were of a mind to pay him handsome tribute. The circumstances of his departure will continue to ide opinion. A 10-try demolition of Worcester, as eloquent as it was brutal, suggested his players feel strongly in favour of his legacy.The gap between Saracens and the rest of the Premiership remains at 18, but the odds are still in favour of them making it up, as the usual clutch of teams separated from each other by a handful of points squirm in discomfort above them. Worcester were squirming within a few minutes of kick-off.“We were comprehensively outplayed by a side who played magnificently,” said Alan Solomons. “They were absolutely outstanding.”More concerning still for Worcester was the neck injury suffered by Michael Fatialofa barely a minute after he had come on. After a lengthy break in play to tend to him, he was taken to St Mary’s hospital in Paddington, where he remained overnight.“It is a massive concern and I’m worried about it, but I haven’t had a report from the hospital. The medics have taken all precautions and have done everything possible. We’ve contacted his partner to let her know.”One need not have been particularly steeped in the rhythms of the Premiership to identify this as a likely candidate for messy mismatch – at least as messy as the Premiership gets. Wray’s retirement in midweek, Saracens’ defeat to Exeter last Sunday, Worcester’s pressure-relieving win – it all suggested a potential disparity in motivation levels.Then there is that yawning deficit Saracens must traverse just to survive in this league they have dominated for so long. Leicester’s full house against Bristol, registered just before kick-off, further heightened the sense of urgency. It should surprise no one that Saracens had their bonus point within half an hour. A half-time lead of 31-0 felt, if anything, on the lenient side for Worcester, as did the final tally. Saracens were held up over the line a further three times.Saracens’ first try was registered in the seventh minute, their second in the 11th. One of their latest problems is the form of those seemingly few among their number not in the England squad. Max Malins sat this one out with a knock to his foot, for which mercy Worcester might be only slightly grateful, but Ben Earl is another youngster likely to be on Eddie Jones’s radar. He was all over Worcester from the start, a barrelling menace with and without the ball.He barged over from close range for the first, after Elliot Daly, Alex Lozowski and the Vunipola brothers, in that order, announced themselves in fine form before England gather for the Six Nations at the end of the month. Rotimi Segun, whistled up on the day following Sean Maitland’s withdrawal, finished the second, put away by Daly after more ferocious approach work by, among others, Earl.Already, the prospects of a meaningful contest were bleak. Brad Barritt burrowed into an advancing maul for try No 3 before Mako Vunipola crashed over for the bonus point after a chip-and-gather cameo from Owen Farrell, whose tackle technique continues to flirt dangerously with the law. There was time for Segun to claim his second before half-time, following a yellow card for Anton Bresler.It is not uncommon for games to even up in such circumstances, even to favour the vanquished, the victors having sated themselves. But Saracens were not sated. No need to describe every try – they were scored in a variety of ways. Special mention for Duncan Taylor’s score on the hour, after a sharp chip and gather by Segun and for the game’s eighth, a few minutes earlier, because it was scored by the Warriors. Ollie Lawrence, comfortably Worcester’s best player once introduced at half-time, set Ed Fidow away for a chip-and-gather adventure of his own.It was a lone highlight for the visitors. With or without their chairman of yore, Saracens remain hungry and on the hunt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cada1c9813ac3a8275ef82c7ca5e1d8fbed57413/0_152_4551_2730/master/4551.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e98f4e33e80493da3bf7a56566d90ce","title":"australia v new zealand third test day three live","story":"30th over: New Zealand 64-0 (Latham 27, Blundell 34) Nothing wrong with his radar or rip, the part-timer right where he should be to the left-handed Latham from round the wicket. The stand-in skipper opens his account for the day with a single cut close to his stumps out to deep point. Nothing wrong with that as far as Australia are concerned. Even if he was bowling that over to help change ends, I suspect Paine will give him another one given how well that set went. The players are on the field. Travis Head is taking the first over?

I don’t know how many more instances of this we need to see before the ICC look at investing in specialist television umpires. It completely undermines DRS more broadly when this keeps happening. They could take care of the front line as well, which became a big issue at Cape Town during South Africa’s innings overnight, Broad shown to have overstepped when finding van der Dussen’s edge. The broadcaster then proved the umpires weren’t looking for it as multiple instances were highlighted of no-balls going uncalled. We need to keep the pressure on with this. Matthew Wade is fine.

While the nation’s attention remains very much fixed on the unfolding bushfire disaster, today at the SCG also marks another important fundraising efforts: Jane McGrath Day in support or breast cancer support and research through the McGrath Foundation. As it has been for the last 11 years, the ground will turn pink with both sides presenting their caps to Glenn McGrath for auction.On the field, this Test is tilted heavily in favour of the home side but the New Zealand tourists held it together admirably on Saturday with ball then bat. Despite Marnus Labuschagne’s heavy accumulation and maiden double ton, they were able to take the seven remaining wickets for 165 runs before reaching 63 for no loss across the final session through Tom Blundell and stand-in skipper Tom Latham.If they can bat all day, the match will be in the ballpark of parity with two days to go. Considering the way the Black Caps have routinely folded on this tour, that would be an achievement in itself and a reminder of why they came into this series as the number two Test side in the world. It won’t be as hot in the middle today, so the Aussie quicks should be able to back up for multiple spells. As always, I’m looking forward to your company throughout the first half of the day before passing the OBO baton to JP Howcroft. Drop me a line at any time.

At the turn of the century, thanks to an enlightened mayor, farmers up and down the valley, which runs parallel to the coast between Genoa and La Spezia, started switching to organic production. The idea spread to hotels and restaurants, artisanal producers and tourist initiatives and led, in 2013, to the creation of the Val di Vara Biodistrict, to represent the businesses and run community events.The area’s Bio Festival, launched in 2018, is now an annual event, with streetfood, games, livestock shows and music. And last summer the Biodistrict started running full-day bus tours of the valley from Levanto on the coast (€47 adult, €25 child, family 2+2 €141, including lunch and tastings).In the past few years, young locals have opened five farms to the public and started 13 agriturismos, offering rustic rooms and farmhouse meals, plus jams, liqueurs, olive oil or meat to buy. Try Il Risveglio Naturale or Il Filo di Paglia. Local cycling enthusiast Marco runs five-hour e-bike tours of the valley – in Italian and English – from agriturismo L’Antico Cornio, with tastings of focaccia, cured meats, cheeses and wine (€60pp, book at foodyexperience).The capital of Val di Vara is Varese Ligure, a walled town dating from 1161, with a castle, medieval churches and a 16th-century stone bridge. On a small riverside square, Pietro Picetti, who is in his 70s, hand-carves wooden moulds for stamping corzetti (or croxetti), the local, disc-shaped pasta – once with prominent families’ coat of arms now often just with pleasing patterns, or your initials! Visitors can have an organic lunch of corzetti pasta with walnut sauce at Albergo Amici in Varese Ligure, before stocking up on foodie gifts from, say, honey and fruit farm Cascina le Bosche or herb and saffron producer Le Piccole Erbe. Dinner could be at the equally organic Antica Locanda Luigina in Mattarana. To work up an appetite for all this bounty, the Vara river and its tributaries offer kayaking, rafting and canyoning (valara.it) and the area is crisscrossed by footpaths including the Alta Via dei Monti Liguri – a 400km ridgetop cyclinghiking route. There’s more adrenaline action on the high ropes and zipwires of Parco Avventura Val Di Vara. Liz BoulterEco-snow sports, Swiss-styleThe Flims Laax Falera region in eastern Switzerland’s Graubünden canton is well-endowed with natural beauty but there’s a particularly primeval air to the landscape here. For starters there’s the Rhine Gorge, known in the local Romansh language as Ruinaulta and more commonly as the Swiss grand canyon. After a huge landslide thousands of years ago, the Rhine scoured a path through the debris, creating what is now a dramatic summer playground for hikers, rafters and bikers. Hikers can also explore the Unesco site of Sardona, where tectonic plates once crunched together, pushing the rock upwards and leaving a distinct limestone line across the mountains.Winter offers snowy walking trails, pro-standard snowparks and 224km of slopes in three linked ski areas. With the highest piste topping 3,000 metres, snow is reliable, yet as in many other Swiss resorts, Flims Laax Falera has recently seen its snowline creep upwards and its ski season shorten. Its plans to tackle the climate crisis are more ambitious than most.A vision of the urban futureRotterdam is a city that’s not afraid to experiment. From the architecture of Rem Koolhaas, one of its most famous sons, to the annual Rooftops Festival, which in 2019 saw 65 rooftops repurposed to host events, Europe’s largest port is a fascinating living laboratory for anyone interested in what urban living might look like in the coming years. There’s even a Sponge Garden for studying how best urban green spaces can be used to capture and hold rainwater and return it to the natural environment.Many of the city’s innovations are focused on a waste-free circular economy. It’s home to the world’s first floating farm, where 32 cows are fed on scraps from local hotels and restaurants, and produce milk for city residents and manure for Rotterdam’s flowerbeds. And at Blue City, a former indoor subtropical swimming complex has been repurposed to provide workspace for more than 30 startups working in the circular economy. “Waste” coffee granules from the Aloha Bar-Restaurant become soil for the mushrooms grown by a neighbouring startup another is fashioning fruit peelings into leather.From 1 May, visitors wanting to immerse themselves in the city’s vision can stay in one of Culture Campsite’s spaces in the riverside Delfshaven district, with choices of upcycled “sleeping objects” including a greenhouse, a silo and a cattle shelter.Although Rotterdam’s main attractions tend to look to the future, it has not forgotten where its citizens came from. With around 180 nationalities calling the city home, it has a claim to be one of the most multicultural in the world. A great place to understand this richness is the Story House Belvédère. This community-run enterprise in the Katendrecht district is part-cafe, part-gallery and part-events space. Headphones lining the walls play recordings gathered from around Rotterdam, sharing the voices of the many cultures that give the city its character, and there are exhibitions by its annual immigrant artist in residence.Jeremy SmithMarine protection and sustainability to savourMenorcans realised early that a sustainable approach to tourism was essential for avoiding the overdevelopment that has spoiled so much of the Mediterranean coast in Spain. A Unesco biosphere reserve since 1993, the island has crystal-clear waters, a thriving local culture and unique gastronomy.The best way to access the white sandy beaches of the south and rocky coves of the north is via the Camí de Cavalls, an ancient path for mounted soldiers connecting defensive lookouts that encircles the island. Thanks to pressure from a local NGO, it was reopened as a public right of way in 2010 and is now much-loved by Menorcans and visitors alike for walking, cycling or horse-riding.Since 2016, the Balearic Islands has collected a sustainable tourism tax and used it to fund local conservation initiatives such as the Underwater Atlas project, which maps the seagrass beds essential to the marine ecosystem so that they are not disturbed by boat anchors. Snorkelling around the coves to the east of Binimel-là beach you’ll find waters bursting with life – look out for octopus and even the odd Moray eel. Last year, some 20 sq km of coastal waters was added to the existing Unesco biosphere reserve, making it the largest protected marine environment in the Mediterranean.Stay at Ses Sucreres (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB) in the pretty, whitewashed village of Ferreries in the centre of the island, and visit the homemade produce market in Plaça Eya, held on Saturday mornings, to sample the Mahón-Menorca cheese, with its distinctive sharp, salty flavour. Seafood also plays a huge role in local cuisine – Es Cranc restaurant in the tiny northern port of Fornells is known for its outstanding caldereta (lobster stew). Menorca is currently in the running for European Region of Gastronomy 2022.Annette PaceyCarbon-neutral capitalShopping, sightseeing and museums are the mainstays of most city breaks. Copenhagen has all these – but where else could you go skiing in the city centre, or float in the clear water of open-air harbour baths? CopenHill, a huge new urban ski slope, was built atop a renewable waste-to-energy power plant. As well as skiing and snowboarding, it has running and hiking trails, and the world’s highest outdoor climbing wall.For outdoor bathing, there are several options, such as the central Islands Brygge baths or the Nordhavn quarter, which has boardwalks, cafes and a beachy vibe. Real seaside isn’t far from the city: Amager Beach Park is an easy 5km bike ride away and has miles of white sand, islands and a lagoon. Other activities in town include sailing in solar-powered GoBoats and kayaking.Copenhagen has pledged to become the world’s first carbon-neutral capital by 2025. It is well on the way to reaching its goal, so is already a great place for a sustainable stay. It’s one of the most bike-friendly cities in the world, so explore it on two wheels – there are many hire points, 375km of cycle tracks and several pedestrianbike bridges over the harbour.Public transport is excellent, and expanding: the metro’s new City Circle line now links the centre with the neighbourhoods of Østerbro, Nørrebro, Frederiksberg and Vesterbro, and another new line opens this year, connecting the northern harbour.Noma put the Copenhagen food scene on the map with its use of ultra-local ingredients and innovative takes on traditional techniques but there are plenty of other restaurants with great food and low carbon footprints. Gro Spiseri is a rooftop farm-cum-restaurant where diners eat in the greenhouses, and Baest has its own microdairy producing cheese from biodynamic Danish milk.More than two-thirds of the city’s hotels hold an eco-certificate. One of the newest is the industrial-chic Hotel Ottilia (doubles from £120 B\u0026ampB), converted from two former brewery buildings in the emerging Carlsberg City district. It serves an organic breakfast, has a free “wine hour” from 5pm-6pm and the rooftop restaurant has views over the city.To get to Copenhagen from the UK without flying, take the Eurostar and onward trains to Brussels, Cologne or Hamburg, stay overnight, then continue to Copenhagen the next morning.

Zieglergasse in the 7th district is Vienna’s first climate-adapted street, completed in December 2019. With drinking fountains, cooling arches, garden and shaded areas, alongside more space for bikes, it has been dubbed the “Cool Mile”. Nearby Neubaugasse, in the same district, will unveil a similar redesign in mid-January, for planned completion by autumn. Construction of a “Cooling Park” in the adjacent 6th district’s Esterházypark is due in spring 2020, and will include two “climate trees” made of three-metre-high mist showers within an expanded shaded, green space.Urban gardening is common, on organic city farms and private allotments, aided by some of the city’s 200 million bees in beehives atop the Vienna State Opera, the Burgtheater and the Old General Hospital. Some districts hold weekly local farmers’ markets, although the main central markets of Naschmarkt, Karmelitermarkt and Brunnenmarkt at Yppenplatz all feature local vendors selling organic produce. Access to fresh mountain water is the norm, with 1,000 free drinking fountains throughout the city.Vienna is proud of its affordable and accessible transport system: the annual inner-city transport card costs €1 a day. With a focus on lowering car usage, the Friday Nightskating event invites people to take to the streets on skates and bikes, as a way to encourage people to see the city without noise or pollution. A push to get more people to use the extensive rail network is backed by Austria’s train operator, OBB. The addition of services to Brussels and northern Romania, on top of routes to neighbouring countries, will establish Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020.Becki EnrightBears, bison and bioersityYou don’t have to fly to southern Africa to go on safari – Romania is one of the best places in Europe to see large mammals in the wild. The country has seven million hectares of forests – a significant proportion is ancient virgin woodland – and is home to the continent’s largest populations of brown bears, as well as wolves and lynx. Among organisations working to protect the wilderness is Foundation Conservation Carpathia (FCC), which has ambitious plans to create the largest forested national park in Europe. Focusing on restoring degraded forests and the wider ecosystem, FCC recently launched an ecotourism programme, including bear tracking. It has built four wildlife hides and trains specialised guides for one- and multi-day trips. FCC is also rolling out a four-year bison reintroduction programme in the region’s Făgăraș mountains, in partnership with the ProPark Foundation for Protected Areas and Conservation Capital. The first animals will be released into the wild this spring.Besides benefiting local communities through wildlife tourism, the reintroduction of bison – which disappeared from Romania 200 years ago – will also increase bioersity. In a separate venture by Rewilding Europe and WWF Romania, the European commission-funded Life Bison project has already released 60 animals in Carpathia’s Tarcu and Poiana Ruscă mountains, with more to come this year. Bison-tracking holidays in the area are offered by the European Safari Company (part of Rewilding Europe). A two-night experience costs from €299, including guiding and meals. The Bison Hillock Association, also involved in the project, offers a choice of trips, too, with hiking, cycling and homestay options.While the country faces issues with extensive illegal logging (two rangers were killed last autumn trying to protect the forests, and protesters took to the streets in November demanding more government action), ecotourism is increasing steadily.“There are challenges but ecotourism is growing organically here and lots of small-scale ethical businesses are opening, using local guides and produce, with the money staying in the community,” said Andrei Blumer, president of the Association of Eco-Tourism in Romania.In the Danube Delta, new conservation projects include the reintroduction of water buffalo on Ermakov island. “We have amazing nature and wildlife and offer something unique in Europe,” said Blumer.Jane DunfordNative culture and natural beautyIt may not come as a surprise that a country led by a 34-year-old female prime minister and an all-female coalition is also a world leader in progressive environmental policies. Among the Finnish coalition’s key policies is a pledge to become a carbon-neutral country by 2035. Tourism is playing its part, with a rigorous sustainability policy that puts protection of the country’s natural environment first. But a commitment to protect nature – and people – runs the length and breadth of the country. In Utsjoki, the northernmost municipality, the 1,200-strong community is reinventing its tourism, after new regulations put an end to salmon fishing, once its largest source of income. Now Utsjoki is promoting its wilderness and Sami culture through mountain biking, kayaking, snow-shoeing and visiting the three villages to experience modern Sami culture, where reindeer husbandry is still a significant part of life.In the east, local company Äksyt Ämmät runs small-group tours of the forest, rivers and lakes of North Karelia. These are hosted by local guides and offer stays in small, family-run guesthouses: from a two-hour snow-shoeing tour through Koli national park (adults from €30 children €15) to a week on an island on Lake Saimaa (from €1,328pp) cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing and meeting villagers.In the autumn, Finland went a step further in its mission to create a tourism industry built on the long-term preservation of the environment, by introducing a tourism pledge, and encouraging visitors to not just enjoy nature but to “respect and treasure” it, too.Isabel ChoatMaking tourism a force for goodTourism has been a game-changer for Portugal, making Lisbon and, more recently, Porto into weekend hotspots with boutique hotels and hipster bars and restaurants. This has not been without a cost – one that’s been borne primarily by local residents and businesses, who find themselves forced out of neighbourhoods by rising rents. Acknowledging that this growth was too rapid, the government is determined that a planned increase in visitor numbers will be managed sustainably, spreading tourism across the country – and the seasons – and putting local people first.It is three years into a 10-year sustainability strategy under which millions of euros has been invested in a variety of programmes aimed at boosting tourism beyond the honeypot destinations. One such programme is Revive, designed to breathe new life into abandoned or run-down heritage sites. One of the first – of 33 – to open was Vila Galé, a former convent converted into a hotel in Elvas, a Unesco-listed but overlooked town near the Spanish border. A similar scheme, Revive Natura, will do the same for rural sites, such as former rangers’ cottages.In the southern Alentejo, the largest artificial lake in Europe, Alqueva, was once ignored even by locals but is now a destination with water sports, beach areas, boutique hotels and a dark sky reserve.Europe’s biggest gardening projectMore than 700 volunteer gardeners have been busy in Salford, removing invasive species from a 154-acre site and planting more welcome ones, including 40,000 crocus bulbs for a dazzling spring display. They are not toiling alone: a small herd of rare-breed pigs has been clearing brambles and digging over the soil. Oh, and there are quite a few professional gardeners on board, too.This is the new RHS Garden Bridgewater, the biggest gardening project in Europe. The £30m-plus site is due to open this summer on the site of Worsley New Hall, a 19th-century mansion on the edge of the city that was demolished in the 1940s. It is the RHS’s first new garden in 17 years and first urban garden, it has been designed by landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith. A million annual visitors are expected to generate £13.8m a year for the local economy by 2029, with 140 jobs in the garden itself and 180 more in the surrounding area. Community is at the heart of this garden. Richard Green, the head of Bridgewater, says: “There is no other garden like this in the north-west of England, not on this scale. It is a mix of stunning horticulture and a place for people.”As well as the green-fingered volunteers, GPs are already referring patients to the garden through a “social prescribing” pilot scheme, whereby people struggling with isolation, mobility problems and other conditions are prescribed activities such as gardening. A dedicated therapeutic gardener, Ozichi Brewster, leads this programme, which has so far helped 40 people. Patients can plant hanging baskets, make bug hotels, go on woodland walks or join tai chi and yoga sessions in the wellbeing garden, a hub for community organisations such as dementia support groups and veterans.Young people have also been helping in the garden under the National Citizen Service. Soon there will be classrooms and a learning garden – about 7,000 local schoolchildren will be invited every year – and apprenticeship schemes. Adults can garden in community allotments in the walled garden four of the plots will be dedicated to growing produce for a local food bank. There are also demonstration areas to inspire visitors to transform their own gardens.Other prominent features include a kitchen garden, providing fruit and vegetables for the cafe a Chinese garden created with Greater Manchester’s Chinese community and a calming “paradise garden” with a huge pond. A wild woodland play area with hobbit holes, a bug garden and a low ropes course is designed to help children of all ages get outside, connect with nature and socialise away from screens.Those who can’t wait for the official opening in the summer can book a two-hour guided tour (£5, until April). Or why not join the green army? The garden is recruiting now for its next batch of volunteers.Ambitious habitat restoration projectIt’s easy to presume that the Cairngorms national park, with its ancient woodlands, peat bogs, untamed rivers and forbidding mountains, is faring well when it comes to conservation. But in fact, much of its native flora and fauna has been damaged by hundreds of years of poor management and a burgeoning deer population. One organisation is now helping turn the tide by putting together the most ambitious vision for habitat restoration Britain has ever seen.Committing to an ecological timeframe of 200 years (there’s no room for a short-term mentality here), neighbouring land managers — including Wildland, RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry and Land Scotland — will work together to restore native woodlands, peatlands, wetlands and rivers.In 2020, visitors will get a better sense of the project thanks to a newly refurbished visitor centre, interpretive walks and volunteering opportunities. Since 1959, when it was just a caravan parked on borrowed land, the Loch Garten Osprey Centre in Abernethy has grown into the RSPB’s second-largest and most erse reserve, home to more than 5,000 species. Thanks to funding from European Structural Funds, the centre will in 2020 be renamed and refurbished with improved access, and open for eight months of the year: the Loch Garten Nature Centre will help explain Cairngorms Connect as part of a wider conservation story.Beyond the centre, interpretive walks will be added to the Big Pines and Two Lochs trails to enhance understanding of the UK’s largest single remnant of ancient Caledonian pinewood.While Cairngorms Connect’s focus for 2020 is getting local communities involved, visitors will get a look-in, too. Volunteers can join one-day projects from seed collecting to planting (once live, opportunities will be advertised on the Cairngorms Connect website).Rewilding tour operator Scotland: The Big Picture has launched a four-day Wilderness Weekend: Cairngorms Connect (15-18 May, from £765pp), which takes visitors on a conservation-oriented journey through the erse landscapes.Also opening in the region next year, as part of the Cairngorms national park’s net zero by 2045 vision, is a Speyside Way extension and a Strathspey electric bike project.Holly TuppenStargazing in the Sperrin mountains, County TyroneThe Sperrin mountains, which straddle the counties of Derry and Tyrone, are often overlooked by visitors heading for the Giant’s Causeway on the Antrim coast, or various Game of Thrones locations. But the Sperrins are “Ulster’s wildest land”, according to Irish poet Mary Montague. “The thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline. But don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak,” she says.The Sperrins area of outstanding natural beauty is a wild, untouched landscape of moorland and forest, punctuated with tarns and bogs. It also offers rare unspoiled views of the night sky. A scatter of neolithic monuments, such as the Beaghmore stone circle, bear testament to the fact that the constellations have long held sway over these parts.In April, Northern Ireland’s first dark sky observatory will open in Davagh Forest, giving visitors the opportunity to experience the night sky away from light pollution.This dense woodland, with miles of moss-covered conifers, has a fairytale quality, with sika deer roaming free and the odd sighting of rare pine martens. It sits in a small valley formed by the Davagh Water, one of the headstreams of the Owenreagh River, and is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. But the £1.2m Dark Sky Park will focus attention upwards, with a telescope trained on the solar system through a retractable roof.A series of audio-visual shows with maps of the solar system will be specially created for night-time events and screened on to the buildings: visitors can watch from a viewing platform, and explore the universe via holographic installations and virtual reality headsets. There will also be exhibitions linking the landscape with the archaeological and astronomical heritage of the Sperrins, as well as a play planetarium for children.And for those who want to extend their stay and sleep under the stars, like the ancients, five glamping pods are being built alongside the centre (from £100 a night for four people, sperrinviewglamping).Andy PietrasikA biosphere reserve is not merely a landscape that’s been put aside for nature, but a place where communities have learned to live alongside natural habitats. The Isle of Wight has been awarded the accolade thanks to its rare wildlife — red squirrels in the woodlands, Glanville fritillaries on chalky cliffs, and the Ventnor wall lizard on sunny, beachfront walls — and sustainable economic development. Collaboration between environmental organisations, charities, councils and local volunteers is improving the island for locals, visitors and nature alike. The Common Space, a non-profit, is working with local volunteers to revitalise the Bay area in the east of the island a 2020 calendar of events includes British Science Week (6-15 March), when pop-up laboratories will showcase natural wonders from pond life to fossils.In Sandown on the south coast, Browns Golf Course is getting a wildlife makeover thanks to a new footpath linking a previously overgrown woodland walk and reedbed wetland. Via the Lost Duver Project, the council and community are also restoring former dune stacks in Sandown by replanting native coastal flora such as ragged-robin and thrift.From a commitment to green building (Tom’s Eco Lodge is powered by a solar field and biomass boiler) to supporting rewilding initiatives (Tiny Homes’ wildflower meadows), tourism is very much part of the island’s biosphere fame.Also launched in 2019, Visit Isle of Wight’s Slow Travel Guide encourages visitors to leave cars at home, with eight car-free touring routes via bus, rail, bike or footpath. The island’s sustainable travel scheme also allows accommodation owners with the highest green ratings, including Nettlecombe Farm (from £370 for four people per week) and Seaview Hotel (from £95), to offer guests free bus travel.Holly TuppenThe Recovery Olympics in JapanThe Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 became a symbol of Japan’s economic rebirth after the second world war, when visitors were dazzled by the country’s ambition. This time around, the organisers of Tokyo 2020 are hoping the games will signal the regeneration of the Tohoku region, which was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and open up a lesser-known part of the country to visitors.The games are billed as the Recovery Olympics, and the Olympic torch - made of aluminium recycled from the temporary shelters used to house 500,000 displaced people – will begin its relay at the J-Village football stadium, just outside the 30km exclusion zone of the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, before moving through the neighbouring prefectures of Miyagi and Iwate, also affected in 2011. The J-Village and Azuma baseball stadium in Fukushima City will host baseball, softball and football matches in the summer.Almost a decade after the disaster this is not an exercise in dark tourism – though one operator has started running Chernobyl-style tours of the Fukushima exclusion zone. Rather, it is an opportunity to discover a more authentic side of Japan – away from the tourist-thronged shrines and temples of Kyoto.The bullet train delivers passengers from Tokyo at warp speed – actually 90 minutes, though it feels like travelling back in time from the frenzy of the 21st-century capital – to what Richard Lloyd Parry describes in his book Ghosts of the Tsunami as a “slower, gentler” arcadia of mountains, lakes, rivers and “fields rich in grain and fruit”. (Tohoku is famous for its high-quality rice, peaches, grapes, Kitakata ramen and sake – though producers have struggled to overcome fears about contaminated food, despite it being exported once more.)Aizu, in the west of Fukushima, is steeped in the history of the samurai, the hard men of the north, but it is also famous for its delicately detailed lacquerware dating back to the 16th century and flourishing in the Edo era (17th-19th centuries). Onsen villages, such as Tsuchiyu, have sprouted around hot springs in the mountains, and to the north, often wreathed in wisps of low-lying cloud like a Hokusai print, lies magnificent Mount Bandai.This conical volcano in the Bandai-Asahi national park is surrounded by lakes, including the vividly cobalt pools of Goshiki-numa. When Olympian Tom Daley visited the region last summer, he stayed at the charming Bandai Lake Guesthouse and performed frontflips and backflips on the jetty by Lake Sohara. The ultimate irony is that this Lake District of Japan was formed by another natural disaster – when Mount Bandai blew its top in 1888.Andy PietrasikCreating a vast nature reserve Tens of millions of bison once thrived on the great plains of north America but by the late 1800s they had almost disappeared. Now the near-threatened species is grazing once again. Some 20,000 now live in America, mostly in small, often fenced-in, herds. But on the high plains of north-east Montana more than 800 beasts roam free. The conservation of this herd (or obstinacy) is just one of many wildlife projects run by American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit that aims to preserve vast tracts of wilderness.Using a similar model to the Tompkins Foundation in Chilean Patagonia, the APR makes strategic purchases of private land that it uses to stitch together tracts of existing public land. Since it started in 2004, APR has bought over 100,000 acres, which has been joined with public land to form 419,000 acres of rolling hills and grassy plateaux drained by the Missouri River. The goal is to form a prairie area of roughly 3.2 million acres, complete with migration corridors – the largest nature reserve in the continental US.The APR’s activities have upset local ranchers and farmers. But founder Sean Gerrity, who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is determined to create a vast ecosystem where wildlife large and small can roam free.As well as bison, it runs projects to protect habitats and increase populations of at-risk animals, including prairie dogs, cougars, pronghorns (endemic deer) and grassland birds. With no fences, the freedom-to-roam philosophy applies to visitors, too. It’s possible to walk, cycle or canoe for miles and see nothing manmade, except the odd signpost. Small-scale accommodation options include two campsites (from $15) with RV hookups a safari-style lodge and two pairs of large yurts – Founders Hut and John and Margaret Craighead Hut – each connected by a hallway and accommodating nine people in four bunk rooms. A third “hut” is due to open this year.Under big Montana skies, visitors can wake up to scenery that has barely changed in centuries, and that will be protected for generations to come. Isabel ChoatBirthplace of Greenpeace grows greenerVancouver calls itself a 20-minute city: it takes 20 minutes to get to the beach, the mountains and the airport. But green space is not in short supply either. Downtown Stanley Park is bigger than Central Park in New York, and is surrounded by water on three sides. Visitors can cycle around it along part of the Seawall, a 28km path around the city’s waterfront. Nearby Vanier Park is a summer hotspot, with its Bard on the Beach Shakespeare festival and big attractions such as the Museum of Vancouver. A little further out, the Pacific Spirit regional park has a network of hiking routes in 1,850 acres of forest, while North Shore is the place to head for legendary mountain biking trails.Now, Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan aims to drastically reduce carbon emissions, with 122,000 new trees planted since 2010. It is a fitting initiative for the birthplace of Greenpeace (the environmental group was founded here in 1971) and Vancouver continues to raise the bar: last month, the world’s first fully electric commercial aircraft took off from here, raising hopes of a new, guilt-free “electric aviation age”.The 100-mile diet – eating only food grown within 100 miles of your home –originated in Vancouver in 2005. Restaurants that have embraced this include Forage, whose executive chef hunts, fishes and keeps bees Chambar, which has been carbon-neutral since 2011 the Acorn, an award-winning “vegetable-forward” restaurant and Edible Canada, which promotes sustainable, seasonal food and stocks an enormous range of Canadian produce for diners to take home.The central Listel hotel (doubles from £90), has a five-Green Key eco-rating and is full of original work by Canadian artists.Rachel DixonSustainable recovery after terror attackIn the past 10 years, Sri Lanka has flourished as a tourist destination. Opening up to visitors since the end of the civil war has meant a growth in accommodation, from tea plantation bungalows and surfer hostels to mountain-view hotels and treehouses among the lush lowland rainforests. The number of tour companies has also increased, with more of them travelling to remote, lesser-visited regions such as the national parks of Gal Oya and Wilpattu, and the coastal areas of Kalpitiya and Kalkudah, benefiting smaller businesses including tuk-tuk drivers, souvenir sellers and family-run restaurants.As the country looks ahead, there are projects to be celebrated. The Sri Lanka Ecotourism Foundation, running since 1998, supports social and economic development of rural communities. Its work ranges from renewable energy projects, such as small-scale wind-solar farm training programmes, to empowering women through ecotourism roles, including a new lagoon-side campsite and activity centre, the Hikkaduwa Women-Centric Ecotourism Project. It also launched a new national sustainable tourism certification for hotels in April 2019.Beyond this, there are compelling sustainability and community-based tourism projects all over the country. Mangrove replanting has been taking place since the 2004 tsunami – including at Kitesurfing Lanka in Kalpitiya. Mangroves are not only an effective defence against the sea, but also help boost wildlife and act as long-term carbon sinks.Waste Less Arugam Bay is a partnership aiming to educate tourists and local communities about plastic – through, for example, reliable waste collection, creating souvenirs from recycled plastic, and providing water bottle refills. Fairtrade homeware and clothing brand Selyn uses a female-led workforce, traditional techniques and maintains a cottage industry via regional producers, which welcome visitors.Joining local families in the lesser-travelled inland part of Tangalle in the south, Experience Travel runs tours to support rural crafts and practices, such as producers of handcrafted buffalo curd, served as a delicious sweet dessert in clay pots called mee-kiri, topped with sticky kithul palm syrup.Antonia WilsonCommunity tourism begins on new Route of ParksFew countries on Earth have allocated more land for environmental protection in recent years than Chile, which in 2018 set aside 10 million acres of Patagonia to be preserved in five national parks. This was due in no small part to the conservation work of American philanthropist Kristine McDivitt Tompkins (ex-CEO of outdoors company Patagonia) and her late husband Doug (co-founder of North Face), who donated a large chunk of the land. In 2020, it will be easier than ever to visit these remote reserves, thanks to the new Route of Parks. Launched last year, the route consolidates a haphazard tourist circuit ning 1,700 miles (and 17 national parks), from the volcano-dotted forests of Chile’s Lake District to the fjords at the southern tip of the continent.Locals in the 60 communities along the route have responded to the Tompkins’ vision by taking ownership of the wilderness and starting tourism projects that will help protect the parks in the long term (as well as create sustainable incomes). Chaitén-based Ruta Patagonia 7 runs tours along the famed Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) to the newly designated Pumalín national park, a rainforest reserve in remote northern Patagonia. Further south, Patagonian Fjords has opened up the previously inaccessible – and newly created – Kawésqar national park to tourism for the first time, with trips through its fog-draped fjords departing from the resort town of Puerto Natales.New hotels have also popped up along the route, including Estancia Caleta Josefina (rooms from £135), on a sheep farm in Tierra del Fuego. And in 2018 Patagonia national park (home to one of the most ambitious rewilding efforts in the Americas) opened a new museum, Patagonia Park Museum, which explores local history and the current extinction crisis. Another museum dedicated to the Anglo-Argentine pioneer Lucas Bridges (author of Uttermost Part of the Earth, the 1947 landmark book on Tierra del Fuego) will open here in 2020.Connectivity, long a barrier to regional development, has improved alongside the new route. There is no land connection between the northern and southern sections of Chilean Patagonia, but a ferry service now links the end of the Carretera Austral with Puerto Natales, making it easier for tourists to travel along a unified path without detouring into Argentina. A road under construction in a remote stretch of Tierra del Fuego will finally open up little-visited Yendegaia national park, which protects the ice fields of the Cordillera Darwin mountain range.Mark Johanson This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Once the monarchs of the weekend schedules and the darlings of the weekday tabloids, now they are facing the end. They are popping six Vicodins a night, trying a garish new look every week and giving all their cash to a shady manager, who is also their sixth husband. They are in a right state.The latest equivalent of a desperate crossover covers album or provincial panto booking is The Masked Singer (ITV), a prerecorded unspectacular crushed at birth by its contrived premise: celebrities sing, while wearing fancy dress that entirely covers their face and body. We, and a panel of judges, must decide who they are, based purely on their performing voice, their gait and an introductory video in which they give cryptic clues with their speech distorted. Welcome to … Celebrity Stars in Their Keyhole!End-of-genre shows always grab fistfuls of concept from other programmes: the revolutionary twist in The Masked Singer is that the masks ruin everything. In Strictly Come Dancing or The X Factor: Celebrity, famous people who are not known as live performers show us how they handle themselves on stage. They do that here, but since we don’t find out who they are until much later, we can’t enjoy the surprise. We are robbed of the chance to whoop as we witness, say, Moira Stuart hitting the high notes in Defying Gravity, or Sally Gunnell proving herself to be a tight rapper. (They are hypothetical examples. Neither of them is on The Masked Singer. Or are they? We don’t know.)All talent shows feature a vote on who is through and who is in danger of leaving, which we get here – members of the studio audience have an app – with the customary reveal, stretched dramatically across a commercial break. Oh God, who is safe? Who is in the bottom three? Wait. I don’t know who anyone is. I don’t care!The guessing game is all we have. Working out who an anonymised celeb is by listening to them speak would be hard enough doing it by scrutinising their singing is impossible. That means the judging panel has a job that is too much even for the gang of silence-filling mercenaries The Masked Singer has recruited. “I recognise the voice, but I don’t know where from,” blathers Jonathan Ross, as a woman in a bee costume delivers a very decent Alive by Sia. Right, thanks. “Who is this person?!” asks Rita Ora, watching a unicorn do Babooshka. None of us knows, Reets. Meanwhile, Davina McCall takes the mature approach and hunts for hidden clues: “Funny. Comedy?” she notes as a duck does a duck walk before desecrating Like a Virgin.Someone has seen the need for a wild card, a cult hero, so the fourth member of the panel is Ken Jeong. This could have been a further maddening “Ooh, who’s that?” parlour game, but we are told from the outset that he was in The Hangover and has been shipped in from the US version of The Masked Singer. There, the mystery contestants have included Gladys Knight, Kelly Osbourne and, confusingly, Seal dressed as a leopard. Anyway, Ken’s shtick is that he does not know any British people, but nevertheless confidently makes guesses. In fairness, his catchphrase – “I know exactly who this is” – gets funnier with repetition and is thus the highlight of the enterprise. When he comically asserts that a butterfly singing You Got the Love might be Angela Lansbury, or pronounces Eddie Izzard to rhyme with “blizzard”, it is not much more ridiculous than the names put forward by the homegrown judges. McCall wonders if the hedgehog performing Black Magic by Little Mix might be … David Thewlis? Gauging who is famous enough to be booked for this show, but not famous enough for their agent to hoot down the phone as they turn it down is tricky, but surely not that tricky.In the middle is your host Joel Dommett, who – for those ITV viewers befuddled even by the identity of the presenter – is a comedian, and also dissonance in a suit: he is a tremulous goof with catalogue-model looks, which helps his standup but doesn’t make it easier to say, “Chameleon, everybody! Yes!” after a nameless man in a revealing green leotard has lost his battle with the falsetto sections of Creep by Radiohead.At the end of the episode, there is a final elimination, whereupon we are shown the face behind the losing mask. The surviving celebrities-dressed-as-animals maintain their anonymity until next week, as The Masked Singer moves towards a season finale where the overall winner will, at last, have their identity revealed. Keeping it secret would be a prize worth winning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddfac4a9ed2f41884b48e55b7e93b9c87a95e4e1/0_20_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16bd566ac67cb91660884897cbc15561","title":"amy klobuchar iowa democrats 2020 election","story":"The Minnesota senator is reaching out to Iowa’s smallest towns and rural settlements ahead of the vital February caucus and seeing increasing numbersCraig Hiller, an Iowa farmer, had just enjoyed a hot chocolate on Amy Klobuchar’s campaign bus as it made a stop in the small town of Rockwell City, population just 2,100.Hiller, whose state is the vital first one to cast ballots in the party’s nomination race to pick an opponent to Donald Trump, was impressed by the Minnesota senator, a fellow midwesterner who desperately needs a strong showing in Iowa to boost her 2020 presidential campaign.“Who we need is someone who someone who’s down to earth, who no one can hate,” Hiller said on Rockwell City’s Main Street as Klobuchar’s bus rolled to its next stop in Cherokee county, 50 miles west. “I don’t know anyone after tonight who fits that better than Amy Klobuchar.”That sort of reaction is music to Klobuchar’s ears as she carried out a gruelling tour through 27 counties in rural Iowa in an attempt to build a groundswell of support through reaching out to the state’s smallest towns and rural settlements. With this strategy, even a couple dozen attendees counts as a success.On her arrival in Rockwell – with temperatures below freezing – 25 people including Hiller had piled aboard the big green Amy bus for hot chocolate. Two dozen others had turned out to see the Minnesota senator in tiny Ida Grove that same day, a county that doesn’t even have 1,000 registered Democrats. But most striking to Klobuchar was a crowd of around 50 packing the Sac County Cattle Company on a Sunday night just before Christmas. It’s where the Republican congressman Steve King, who hails from Kiron, 30 miles south, stumps and dines with family. The proprietor said Klobuchar’s crowds were at least the size of King’s, or any other Republican who has come calling.“We’re approaching this like we can win, and all signs are pointing in the right direction,” Klobuchar told the . “A crowd that size in Sac City, anywhere in rural America, means something. I’m especially glad it’s in Steve King’s backyard.”Klobuchar is blunt about her shared background with Iowa’s voters. She brags about being from the midwest, and how she can win in rural Minnesota counties that Trump took by 20 points. In the last Democratic debate she took a dig at the location of a rival’s fundraiser by saying she’s never been to a wine cave, but she’s been to a wind cave in South Dakota. A mention of Trump is usually followed with a mention of the tanking of corn and soybean prices from trade wars. Her entire argument is built around electability in midwest swing states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.“He’s treating farmers like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos,” she said to the delight of her audience at one stop. By contrast, she says she remembers her neighbors saving spare cash in coffee cans growing up.The question is whether her momentum, which is mainly confined to Iowa, is too little too late. In less than six weeks, caucusgoers will trudge through a frigid night to precinct meetings in schoolhouses and courthouses – while she may be chained to Trump’s impeachment trial in the US Senate, which is set to start sometime in January and last for an unknown time.“To say it’s an uphill battle would definitely be accurate, even charitable,” said Brad Best, a longtime caucus observer and political science professor at Buena Vista University in Storm Lake. “In an ironic way, her stardom in the Senate will hurt her campaigning in Iowa, where she desperately needs to do well.”Yet, there are precedents. John Kerry came from the shadows in 2004 less than two weeks before the caucuses to win, and later secure the nomination. Klobuchar says a doubling of office spaces in Iowa and positive responses in Des Moines RegisterCNN Iowa polls are signs of hope. Best says her strongest advantage is that overwhelming majorities of probable caucusgoers have favorable opinions of her and list her in their top three selections.“I’d say I know Iowans pretty well, and they really like honesty, which is what we aren’t seeing from the man in the White House,” Klobuchar said, citing the 39 counties in Iowa that voted for Trump in 2016 and Barack Obama in 2008.She says people there have a thirst for economic prosperity that can be achieved realistically, not with promises like Medicare for All. She never mentions challengers from the progressive wing by name. “We can win them back telling the truth. We can bring those people back.”Congressional candidate JD Scholten, a Sioux City Democrat running against King, likes Klobuchar’s strategy of dwelling on rural voters. He just capped off a 39-county bus tour of western Iowa in a camper.Scholten said voters in rural areas like Sac City and Rockwell City are easier to organize than in Democratic metro strongholds such as Des Moines or Iowa City. Those who show up in Rockwell City are reliably Democratic and less issue-focused. Rarely do they see a candidate with Klobuchar’s resume. When they do, they leave with a strong impression.“It’s a lot easier to get viability in Sac county than Polk county,” said Scholten. “She recognizes that people are familiar with her. Sac City isn’t a long way from the Iowa-Minnesota border.”Those who hear Klobuchar’s message like her focus on the midwest. After the Sac City event, one farmer – who declined to offer his name because his landlord is Republican – said Klobuchar’s retelling of family stories from the iron ore mines and farms of northern Minnesota struck him as authentic.“It’s not a story she picked up from somewhere. It’s one you can tell she’s from here, she’s one of us who faces the same problems we do,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d85bbe21de988d3bdb61e88fa476205270d56977/0_91_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=396200b02dd1d66d02c049267ea25332","title":"us military draft iran selective service system","story":"Selective Service System said on Twitter its website was receiving high traffic volume ‘due to the spread of misinformation’In the aftermath of the US drone strike that killed the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad, the phrase “World War III” began trending on social media.More startlingly, a US government agency which registers young men for a potential military draft saw its website crash.“Due to the spread of misinformation,” the Selective Service System (SSS) tweeted on Friday, “our website is experiencing high traffic volumes at this time … We appreciate your patience.”It added that it was “conducting business as usual” and emphasised that a return to the draft is not imminent: “In the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the president would need to pass official legislation.”On Saturday, as Twitter panic subsided, the SSS website was up and running, if slowly.The US first drafted soldiers during the civil war in the 1860s, prompting deadly, racist riots. A hundred years later, opposition to conscription fuelled protests against the Vietnam war. There has been no draft since 1973.Experts including Mittelstadt, however, have said reinstating the draft might in fact help build a more inclusive society.Should the US and Iran go to war, America’s fighting will be done by its volunteer military, about 1.3 million strong and dominated in the enlisted ranks by recruits from working-class and minority groups.Writing for the  in 2014, the long-serving New York Democratic congressman Charles Rangel said: “The same familiar faces have served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A more inclusive military draft … would compel everyone in the nation to stop and rethink about who we send to wars, how we fight – and why we fight them at all.”All American men aged 18 to 25 are required by law to register with the SSS. Many do so when applying for a driver’s license or applying for student loans. Those who do not register cannot receive federal financial aid or work for the federal government.A return to the draft may remain unlikely, but the SSS says it is prepared to “rapidly provide personnel in a fair and equitable manner while managing an alternative service program for conscientious objectors”.According to the agency’s website: “Current plans are frequently tested, evaluated, and revised as necessary.“If implemented, they will guide the Selective Service System in making a smooth transition from current reduced readiness levels to full conscription within six months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c135649f4c5df465c02b96c7dcacd2decf16498/0_7_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ded7bd42ec1d9ec22a676942ae41a0","title":"us political assassinations history iran suleimani","story":"There has been no shortage of US attempts to remove foreign adversaries through highly dubious legal or ethical means The US government is no stranger to the dark arts of political assassinations. Over the decades it has deployed elaborate techniques against its foes, from dispatching a chemist armed with lethal poison to try to take out Congo’s Patrice Lumumba in the 1960s to planting poison pills (equally unsuccessfully) in the Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s food.But the killing of Gen Qassem Suleimani, the leader of Iran’s elite military Quds force, was in in a class all its own. Its uniqueness lay not so much in its method – what difference does it make to the victim if they are eviscerated by aerial drone like Suleimani, or executed following a CIA-backed coup, as was Iraq’s ruler in 1963, Abdul Karim Kassem? – but in the brazenness of its execution and the apparently total disregard for either legal niceties or human consequences.“The US simply isn’t in the practice of assassinating senior state officials out in the open like this,” said Charles Lister, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington. “While Suleimani was a brutal figure responsible for a great deal of suffering, and his Quds force was designated by the US as a terrorist organization, there’s no escaping that he was arguably the second most powerful man in Iran behind the supreme leader.”Donald Trump’s gloating tweets over the killing combined with a sparse effort to justify the action in either domestic or international law has led to the US being accused of the very crimes it normally pins on its enemies. Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, denounced the assassination as an “act of international terrorism”.Vipin Narang, a political scientist at MIT, said the killing “wasn’t deterrence, it was decapitation”.There has been no shortage of US interventions over the past half-century that have attempted – and in some cases succeeded – in removing foreign adversaries through highly dubious legal or ethical means. The country has admitted to making no fewer than eight assassination attempts on Castro, though the real figure was probably much higher.William Blum, the author of Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II, points to a litany of American sins from invasions, bombings, overthrowing of governments, assassinations to torture and death squads. “It’s not a pretty picture” is his blunt conclusion.The CIA was deemed to have run so amok in the 1960s and 70s that in 1975 the Church committee investigated a numerous attempted assassinations on foreign leaders including Lumumba, Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic, Vietnam’s Ngo Dinh Diem and, of course, Castro. In the fallout, Gerald Ford banned US involvement in foreign political assassinations.The ban didn’t last long. Since 1976 the US has continued to be engaged in, or accused of, efforts to eradicate foreign leaders.Ronald Reagan launched bombing raids in 1986 targeting Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi. As recently as two years ago North Korea alleged that the CIA tried to assassinate its leader, Kim Jong-un.But most of the interventions in the modern era have been covert and conducted beneath the radar. Where they have been proclaimed publicly, they have tended to target non-state actors operating in militias or militant groups like Islamic State.Barack Obama and Trump both claimed huge public relations victories when they oversaw the killings of Osama bin Laden and the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, respectively.By contrast, until Trump the US has tended to fight shy of conducting overt assassination attempts on state actors connected to sovereign regimes. Suleimani himself is a case in point.In 2008, the CIA worked hand in glove with the Israeli intelligence service the Mossad to target Imad Mughniyah, a senior Hezbollah leader, for assassination. In the course of their efforts they had the chance of taking out not only Mughniyah but also Suleimani in a single drone strike. In the end, the operation was called off because the US government blocked it on grounds that it could seriously have destabilised the region.Despite such reticence, Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of international law at the University of Notre Dame, draws a direct line between earlier US administrations and the convention-shredding unpredictability of Trump. She said the advent of the unmanned drone in 2000 put the US on a slippery slope towards the current crisis.The first deployment of a drone as an assassination tool was ordered by Bill Clinton in an effort to get Bin Laden. The first successful “targeted killing”, as it is now called, came soon after, carried out by the Bush administration in Yemen.Obama inherited Bush’s widespread use of drone killings and increased their frequency tenfold, while seeking to give them a veneer of legal respectability with the secret internal “targeted killing memos”. Those documents argued that drone assassinations were justified under international law as self-defense against future terrorist attacks – a rationale that has been widely disputed as a misreading of the UN charter.“Since Obama there has been a steady dilution of international law,” O’Connell said. “Suleimani’s death marks the next dilution – we are moving down a slope towards a completely lawless situation.”O’Connell added that there was only one step left for the US now to take. “To completely ignore the law. Frankly, I think President Trump is there already – his only argument has been that Suleimani was a bad guy and so he had to be killed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

He noted that months of negotiations with the People’s party had already produced a plan for a 2021 tax reform that emphasises environmental protection.“Big, fat, stinking diesel SUVs are going to get more expensive,” Kogler told the party meeting in Salzburg, citing the current wildfires in Australia as an example of natural disasters fuelled by climate change.The Greens want Austria to become carbon-neutral in 2040, a decade earlier than the EU’s target.The election became necessary after the collapse of Kurz’s previous coalition government with the Freedom party following the release of a video showing its then-leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, offering favours to a purported Russian investor.The Austrian coalition is being closely watched as a possible template for a future government in neighbouring Germany, where the Green party has also been riding high in recent polls.

Few did. His father, Chiune Sugihara, was a trader who lived in a small coastal town about 34 miles south of Tokyo. When not on business trips to Moscow, he coached his young son in mathematics and English. He made breakfast, spreading butter on the toast so thinly “nobody could compete”.His son had no idea his father saved 6,000 Jews during the second world war. Over six weeks in the summer of 1940, while serving as a diplomat in Lithuania, Chiune Sugihara defied orders from his bosses in Tokyo, and issued several thousand visas for Jewish refugees to travel to Japan.Now the life and legacy of his father will be celebrated in Lithuania, 80 years after he issued “visas for life” to refugees who sought his help. Lithuania’s government has declared 2020 “the year of Chiune Sugihara”: an official programme promises an exhibition of photographs in Lithuania’s parliament, as well as concerts, conferences, films, postage stamps and a monument erected in Kaunas, Lithuania’s former capital, where Sugihara was posted in 1939. It is all part of the burgeoning memorialisation of Sugihara, who in 1984, two years before he died, was declared “righteous among the nations” by Yad Vashem, the Israeli state organisation that commemorates the Holocaust.Chiune Sugihara was sent to Kaunas in the autumn of 1939 to open a consulate, soon after Nazi tanks had rolled into neighbouring Poland. At first glance, it was a curious posting for the up and coming diplomat who, by leaving blank an entrance exam paper for medical school, had defied his father’s wish for him to become a doctor. There were no Japanese people registered as living in the country, thousands of miles from the Pacific. But Kaunas was an ideal place for Japan to check up on its ally, Nazi Germany, whom it suspected of making a secret pact with Joseph Stalin, as well as plotting an invasion of the Soviet Union. Both suspicions were confirmed by Sugihara’s contacts with Polish spies, and reconnaissance of Nazi troop movements, sometimes done under the guise of a picnic.Lithuania would suffer a double occupation by Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. But for nearly 10 months at the start of the second world war, Kaunas was the free capital of independent Lithuania, “a Casablanca of the north”, a hotbed of spies, as well as a short-lived haven for refugees fleeing Soviet and Nazi occupiers.Sent to Lithuania to gather intelligence, Sugihara had probably not bargained for the scores of refugees who arrived at his gates in 1940. After the Soviet Union invaded Lithuania on 15 June, refugees flocked to the modest two-storey Japanese consulate that was also home to Sugihara, his wife Yukiko, their two toddlers and a newborn. Many were Polish Jews, who had arrived only months earlier after the Soviet invasion of Poland. Now they were looking for a second escape.Sugihara sought instructions from his foreign ministry in Tokyo. He was told not to issue visas to anyone without proper papers, ruling out almost everyone in the queue. Making another request to Tokyo, he was told not to ask again. He decided to issue visas anyway. Over six weeks in July and August, he worked 18-hour days, eventually writing out by hand 2,139 transit visas – a record only discovered years later in the archives of Japan’s foreign ministry.Sugihara’s story is “a kind of bright light” for Lithuania, says Simonas Strelcovas, a historian who has written a book about the Japanese diplomat and the refugees who fled to Lithuania. He found the overlooked fact that many of the Polish Jews were fleeing Soviet repression rather than the Holocaust, which had not yet begun.He highlights that these refugees survived because of Sugihara’s actions, combined with the Lithuanian government’s openness to refugees until the Soviet invasion in June 1940. It is a record that contrasts with the later participation of some Lithuanians in the murder of Jews, documented by the Yale historian, Timothy Snyder. “Those refugees lived without any problem from autumn 1939 to the summer of 1940 because of the Lithuanian state,” Strelcovas said. “We need as much Sugihara’s story as Japan needs Sugihara today.”Sugihara’s lifesaving visas were just one part of the paper trail. A Dutch businessman-turned-diplomat, Jan Zwartendijk, issued many Polish refugees with final destination visas to the Dutch colony of Curaçao in the Caribbean. Another forgotten player was Stalin.Sugihara, who spoke fluent Russian, had to bargain with Moscow to ensure the Jewish refugees had safe passage through the Soviet Union, as well as the right to leave Vlaostok for Japan. The promise of hard currency earned from the sale of refugees’ travel documents helped the Politburo reach its decision in July 1940. Stalin signed the order approving transit for refugees, which the Soviet document said included Jewish religious (yeshiva) teachers and students, salesmen, lawyers and other liberal professions.While these players are often left out of the Sugihara story, other Hollywood-style embellishments have been woven in. Often repeated is the claim that Sugihara’s wife, Yukiko, massaged daily her husband’s hands, worn out after writing hundreds of visas. Their youngest son casts doubt on this romantic detail, pointing out his mother and older brothers were already living at a nearby hotel for their safety. Another tale has Sugihara flinging blank visa papers out of the train window as he left Kaunas for the last time, a detail his son said was “not true at all”, pointing out the station would have been full of Soviet soldiers. Sugihara may have surreptitiously written out a final few visas to people on the platform. “There was no chance that he would throw something off the train,” said his son, who also rejects reports that Sugihara gave away an official government stamp to the Polish underground.Beyond the record of 2,139 names Sugihara filed belatedly to Tokyo months after issuing visas, there is no certainty over how many lives were saved. The estimate of 6,000 comes from assuming each holder of a transit visa travelled with two other people, a wife and child. Other researchers have suggested that 10,000 people were saved.In an undated letter to a Polish scholar written after the war, Sugihara said 3,500 people might have benefited from his visas. “The actual numbers nobody knows,” said his son."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd4cc37e78c08444f434fee67456e1b16156bf6/0_243_4051_2431/master/4051.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5312ce7a6b5383a569c66df43690cf4","title":"life for retired opera singers in the house that verdi built","story":"Old and young alike are now benefiting from the composer’s home for retired musiciansRenato Franco Perversi and Irena Domowicz are squabbling over who does the better rendition of the Neapolitan classic, O Sole Mio. Perversi, 87, sings deep, while Domowicz, who says you must never ask a woman her age, immediately replicates the kind of performance she might have given during her career as a mezzo-soprano.“There is more theatre in here sometimes than in the outside world,” she joked.Hardly surprising. The pair are among the 60 retired opera stars playing out their days in an elegant mansion in Milan founded by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. Verdi, famous for compositions including La Traviata, Aida and Otello, was in his 80s when he conceived the idea of a refuge for musicians who, he said, “are not favoured by fortune, or who, when they were young, did not possess the virtue of saving”.He did not want to be thanked for his generosity, and so stipulated that the home be opened after his death. The composer died in 1901, and the first nine guests moved into Casa Verdi a year later. For the next few decades, royalties from Verdi’s 27 works paid for the residents’ keep, including medical costs, and the building’s maintenance.Today most of the costs are covered by investments made by the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation, with residents paying according to their means.“The motives for which Giuseppe Verdi chose to build this house are still valid,” said Roberto Ruozi, president of the Giuseppe Verdi Foundation. “In the sense that there are numerous personalities who have dedicated their lives to music, who need to enter into a retirement home as they no longer have the economic means to sustain themselves, or who have complicated family lives.”Over the last 117 years, Casa Verdi has hosted 1,500 guests from across the musical spectrum, some of them famous, others less so. Perversi played the violin at La Scala for 10 years, while Domowicz toured with philharmonic orchestras across the globe. Another resident is 94-year-old Bissy Roman, a musicologist who was teaching well into her 70s.“Music is my life and I am very lucky to be here with other musicians,” said Roman.Casa Verdi is not so much of a “rest home” in the traditional sense. The sound of music is everywhere. On the morning the  visited, guests were wrapping up a singing session around the piano. Instruments fill the rooms, including a wooden spinet gifted to Verdi to practise on as a child, while concerts are a regular occurrence.The home is also a museum to Verdi, containing items of his clothing, letters and paintings he commissioned from poor artists. The composer is nearby, having been laid to rest in Casa Verdi’s courtyard alongside his wife, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous?

What is your favourite work?”, the maestro replied: “The home I built in Milan for retired musicians.”The only big alteration to Casa Verdi came in 1999, when it was opened up to 20 music students, an initiative aimed at assisting young people as well as bringing the generations together. The two groups mix and the older musicians give the young people invaluable guidance.“For the elderly people, the youngsters are injections of life and vice-versa, for the young people, the elderly are their teachers,” said Ruozi.Roman said that one of the best things about living in Casa Verdi was the students. Among her favourites is Corrado Neri, a 25-year-old singer and composer from Sicily.“When I first came to Milan I really struggled to find a place to stay and study,” said Neri, who through Roman’s connections has been collaborating with a music company in New York. “I had applied to Casa Verdi and two years later they called to say there was a place. It was the best thing that could have happened to me. These people are my family and best supporters, I have learned so much from them.”Perversi has been a resident since early 2016. “There are no words to describe Verdi’s generosity … we still feel him around us,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary place to live, and yes, even though these are our final days, Verdi has given us the possibility to live well.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

He seized power in 1986 after taking part in rebellions to end the rule of Idi Amin and Milton Obote, and is expected to seek a sixth term in office in elections due in 2021. Critics dismissed the march as an attempt to rally support ahead of the poll.Museveni began what will be a 120-mile (195-kilometre) walk from Galamba, north of Kampala, to Birembo, south of the capital where his rebel army faced one of its toughest battles in the fight to overthrow Obote.“The great trek started today and will last six days. This is a journey that the president is leading, a journey through the past to appreciate the present,” Museveni’s senior press secretary, Don Wanyama, said.“The journey will take a week through the jungle, a route the liberators led by Museveni took to liberate the country.”The walk comes a month after the president led an anti-corruption walk through the capital in a move derided by critics who said the corruption took place under his government.Museveni is facing an election challenge from Bobi Wine, a pop star turned leading opposition politician who appeals to a youthful population that has only ever known one president.The trek “is part of the wasteful ventures government is taking aimed at boosting his dwindling support among Ugandans”, Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said.“My advice is rather than spending taxpayers’ money on such trips, Museveni should know time is up for him to leave power.

Union sources said 800 staff had been put on desk-sharing arrangements known as “hot desking”, with hundreds more to be placed on the system in the new year.Letters to management in the Central Bank from trade union Unite, seen by The , warn of “damage to productivity” and a “huge amount of frustration” among staff, with unions claiming the bank is in breach of agreements on desk-sharing signed when the Central Bank moved from its old headquarters on Dame Street in the city centre.One letter sent in July of 2019 outlines a range of measures Unite wants management to take, including “that isional and senior management vacate all personal offices, as a show of solidarity with colleagues across the bank, enabling such offices to be used more productively by staff”. It also suggested the bank formally move to a policy allowing staff to work two days per week from home, and that staff be allowed to choose to perform normal duties at weekends if they so wish. The bank rejected these suggestions, later correspondence reveals. Working patternsThere are currently 1,500 desks in the Central Bank, but unions estimate staff numbers are as high as 1,800 with a further several hundred contractors also operating in the building. The bank has argued that working patterns mean these workers will never be in the office all at the same time, and therefore has introduced a system whereby there are 100 desks for every 120 workers. This system is operated by managers who assign desks on a day-by-day basis within the same general area. A spokeswoman for the bank said “We acknowledge that it takes a little getting used to this new way of working. But we are very confident in the adaptability of our staff to operate the new arrangement effectively.” However, the changes have caused deep disquiet among some staff, who have asked their union to step in. “The implementation of hot desking has already led to a large amount of concern expressed to us by staff, who are experiencing damage to productivity and difficulty in collaborating with team members, as well as a huge amount of frustration in engaging with the whole process.”‘Flexibility’ conceptThe matter was referred to the Workplace Relations Commission, with unsuccessful talks held at the end of November. Further talks at the WRC are scheduled for later in January. However, unions believe the situation will be made worse with several hundred more staff set to be asked to take part in hot desking. Stances from the union and the bank in relation to the stand-off are expected to harden, with a bank spokeswoman saying the allocation of workspace is “not a matter of collective agreement between the Central Bank and trade unions”. The spokeswoman said “flexibility” was built into the design for the headquarters at North Wall Quay, which delivers “a modern, progressive and efficient workspace for our staff”. The Central Bank is currently developing a new office in the new Dublin Landings area, immediately to the north of its new headquarters. It will accommodate staff who work in its Spencer Dock office, which is up for sale. The same working practices will then come into place in these offices, the bank said. “This consolidates all our city centre accommodation into one connected campus and the same progressive design principles used in North Wall Quay will be replicated in the Dublin Landings premises.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4130835.1578162269!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"n%C3%B3ra quoirin s parents file civil claim against malaysian resort","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Nóra Quoirin (15)  who went  missing from a Malaysian rainforest resort last August. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesLawyers in Malaysia representing the parents of Franco-Irish teenager Nóra Quoirin have filed a civil suit against the operator of the Dusun holiday resort where Nóra was staying when she disappeared last August.The Quoirins are claiming at least €40,000 in damages and claim the resort failed to keep the premises in which they were staying safe and secure.The defendant in the suit is Helen Marion Todd, who operates the resort.The statement of claim was filed on December 24th in the Seremban Sessions Court, Negeri Sembilan, by Sankara N Nair and partners on behalf of Nóra’s mother and father, Meabh Josephine Quoirin and Sebastien Marie Philippe Quoirin. The date for the first case management hearing has been set for January 21st at Seremban Sessions Court.The statement of claim states that Nóra Quoirin went through pain and suffering from August 4th until August 13th, 2019. The 15-year-old’s body was found in the jungle about two kilometres from the Dusun resort by a group of hikers who had volunteered their help in the massive 10-day search. The Quoirins plead that their daughter’s disappearance and death “were caused directly by the defendant’s negligence andor recklessness, both by way of act or conduct and omission”.A spokeswoman for the Dusun resort said that a statement would not at the moment be issued in response to the allegations. Nóra’s parents are making a claim against Ms Todd for special damages in the sum of 152,707.90 ringgit (about €33,372), general damages as assessed by the sessions court, damages for bereavement of 30,000 ringgit (about €6,555), and “damages for pain and sufferings”.On October 8th last year, through their lawyers in Malaysia, the Quorins demanded that the defendant pay them damages, but, the statement of claim alleges Ms Todd had so far “failed, neglected andor refused to pay any damages”. Window latch brokenThe statement of claim states that, on or about March 18th, 2019, the plaintiffs booked and paid for a three-night stay at the Dusun resort from August 3rd until August 6th, 2019.The family had intended to spend three days at the resort before travelling around Malaysia.After travelling from overseas, Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin checked into the resort with Nóra and their two other younger children on August 3rd. After the journey “they were exhausted and went to bed”, their claim states.The next morning, at or about 8 am, Nóra’s parents discovered she was missing and noticed that the window in the living area of the bungalow in which they were staying was ajar.Their statement of claim alleges that the latch on the window was broken and the window could easily be opened by anyone from outside.It is also alleged that the perimeter fencing was not secured and the entrance gate of the Dusun was kept open at all times and no security personnel were in place to guard the property.Furthermore, it alleges that there was no closed-circuit television and no other safety facilities were installed at the resort.It notes that Nóra was born with a medical condition known as holoprosencephaly which left her with balancing and coordination difficulties. “In addition her motor skills and core strength were very poor, and the deceased was unable to walk without the help of an adult. The mental age of the deceased at the time of death was about five or six years old only.”PostmortemsAfter the postmortem on Nóra’s body, Malaysian police said on August 15th that there was no evidence of foul play. The police said the cause of death was upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to a duodenal ulcer complicated with perforation. The bleeding in Nóra’s intestine was most likely caused by prolonged hunger and stress, Negeri Sembilan police chief Mohamad Mat Yusof said. The final results of the postmortem carried out in Malaysia, including the toxicology reports, have not yet been released.The Quoirins are also still awaiting the results of a second postmortem, carried out in London.Nóra’s parents have said they believe there was a criminal element in the disappearance and death of their daughter and have called on the Malaysian authorities to open an inquest.Mr Nair says he suspects that Nóra was abducted."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Europeans have not helped US enough, says Mike Pompeo after strike on Iranian generalOver 1,000 people and 110 pets transferred by ship after being stranded on a beach by firesForecasters say conditions are deteriorating rapidly as death toll reaches 23Beijing replaced Wang in sign of dissatisfaction with Liaison Office\u0026rsquos handling of crisisEscalating bush fire disaster set to intensify pressure on prime minister Scott MorrisonMother reveals son\u0026rsquos near-death ordeal as camping trip derailed by Australian blazeAir force deployed as death toll reaches 43 following deadly floods in Indonesian capitalQueues form at petrol stations and supermarkets, with conditions set to deteriorateFive of 13 on board survive as authorities investigate cause of incident near TaipeiLandslides and flash floods cause chaos in Indonesia\u0026rsquos capital following heavy rainAs \u0026lsquorural surplus labour\u0026rsquo, Uighurs and Kazakhs are relocated and forced into factories\u0026lsquoOur biggest mistake was education, in particular ideological and political education\u0026rsquoKim Jong-un to reveal new \u0026lsquostrategic weapon\u0026rsquo amid frustration over stalled US talksLargely peaceful anti-government protest turns chaotic as petrol bombs thrownThousands forced to flee to beaches as columns of fire and smoke blacken entire townsBlazes destroy more than 4m hectares, with new blazes sparked into life almost daily\u0026lsquoI have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution\u0026rsquoHolidaymakers sheltering on beaches told to enter the water if fires intensifyNew Delhi Letter: Cow safaris and ambulances among schemes promoted by ruling BJP"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Golden Globes 2020: Ricky Gervais regrets Tim Allen joke and won\u0026#39t \u0026#39go after\u0026#39 the stars this yearEleanor Tomlinson as Steve McQueen: stars pose for paintings in their dream rolesTaxpayers will suffer £40billion loss if HS2 goes ahead, official reviewer warnsComment: Leavers and Remainers need to learn the lesson of the Scouts and put isions of Brexit behind themHow Parliament was \u0026#39misled\u0026#39 into backing project that won\u0026#39t reach North for 20 yearsBoris Johnson to keep civil service chief in Britain to take charge of reformsJeremy Paxman dumps flytipping blame at door of ministersComment: There has never been a better time to shake up the rail industry and deliver resultsComment: HS2 review was unduly influenced and lacked independence Comment: The UK\u0026#39s brightest and best can give us fresh optimism in EU negotiationsMaimed policeman seeks rougher ride for dangerous driversFraudster on the run from 8 year jail term taunts victims with Instagram account of his lavish lifestyle  Ministers set to lose their farm subsidies when they vote for Brexit this weekComment: Don\u0026#39t trash your civil service Mr Johnson - it is, in fact, a world beaterBBC\u0026#39s top journalists to be told to rein in their use of Twitter after an election which saw presenters criticised for \u0026#34bias\u0026#34New minister Nadine Dorries submitted three novels before joining government and is still writing 1,000 words a day Wife of British-Iranian engineer in Tehran prison fears Soleimani strike has destroyed all hope of releaseComment: Britain is rubbish at rubbish.

He admitted that he regrets one joke in particular, aimed at the actor Tim Allen, after realising how much he had hurt Allen’s feelings.Allen, the veteran actor and voice of Buzz Lightyear in the Toy Story trilogy, was jointly presenting an award with Tom Hanks at the 2011 Globes ceremony.“What can I say about our next two presenters? The first is an actor, producer, writer and director whose movies have grossed over $3bn at the box office. He has won two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes… the other is Tim Allen.”When the two actors walked on to the stage, Hanks said in an unscripted remark to the audience: “Like many of you, we recall when Ricky Gervais was a slightly chubby but kind comedian.”Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Sunday night\u0027s ceremony, Gervais insisted that his routine would be near-the-knuckle.But when asked who would be his firing line, the comic said: “Well, I don’t think this time iniduals are. I think I’ll go after the general community.“I’d go after cinema and I’d go after television and I’d go after actors and I’ll go after pretension and hypocrisy. I’d go after those big, nebulous things where they can all feel I’m not picking on any one person. I’m never going to point to someone and say, ‘You had a bad year, mate.’”He added: “I might do the odd one, but… only if it’s bad behaviour. But I’m for forgiveness as well. I have to go after people bigger than them even, I have to go after studios, I’ve got to go for the top.”Ricky Gervais said he regretted making a joke that poked fun at Tim Allen“And I have nothing against Tim Allen. He’s a good actor. He’s probably a nice bloke. So even though there’s no malice and I can justify it comedically and everyone laughed, I didn’t want Tim Allen to think, ‘Oh, that was written for me. Why me?’”That same year, Gervais joked that the “airbrushed” poster for Sex and the City 2 should win the award for special effects, adding that the cast were so old he had seen one of them “in an episode of Bonanza”.Afterwards, one of the film’s stars, Kim Cattrall, called it “a cheap joke” and accused Gervais of ageism.This year’s ceremony will be an environmentally-friendly, meat-free affair after the organisers decided to make it Hollywood’s first “sustainable” awards ceremony. Guests will eat a vegan menu of chilled beet soup and mushroom risotto.Netflix dominate this year’s nominations, which  film and television. Three of the five best picture nominees in the drama category are from the streaming service: The Irishman, Marriage Story and The Two Popes.But the favourites to win the acting awards are Renee Zellweger for Judy, in which she plays Judy Garland in the final year of her life, and Joaquin Phoenix for his role in The Joker.Eleanor Tomlinson as Steve McQueen: stars pose for paintings in their dream rolesTaxpayers will suffer £40billion loss if HS2 goes ahead, official reviewer warnsComment: Leavers and Remainers need to learn the lesson of the Scouts and put isions of Brexit behind themHow Parliament was \u0026#39misled\u0026#39 into backing project that won\u0026#39t reach North for 20 yearsBoris Johnson to keep civil service chief in Britain to take charge of reformsJeremy Paxman dumps flytipping blame at door of ministersComment: There has never been a better time to shake up the rail industry and deliver resultsComment: HS2 review was unduly influenced and lacked independence Comment: The UK\u0026#39s brightest and best can give us fresh optimism in EU negotiationsMaimed policeman seeks rougher ride for dangerous driversFraudster on the run from 8 year jail term taunts victims with Instagram account of his lavish lifestyle  Ministers set to lose their farm subsidies when they vote for Brexit this weekComment: Don\u0026#39t trash your civil service Mr Johnson - it is, in fact, a world beaterBBC\u0026#39s top journalists to be told to rein in their use of Twitter after an election which saw presenters criticised for \u0026#34bias\u0026#34New minister Nadine Dorries submitted three novels before joining government and is still writing 1,000 words a day Wife of British-Iranian engineer in Tehran prison fears Soleimani strike has destroyed all hope of releaseForeign terror suspect thought to have been planning an IS-style attack granted legal aid to fight extraditionLegal row over sale of vintage Porsche to billionaire car enthusiastComment: Britain is rubbish at rubbish.

No doubt your imagination is filled with a fantasy out of Kevin McCloud\u0027s Grand Designs: all efficient insulation and recycled materials, wooden walls and a green roof.That vision in your mind is the opposite of our house. For one, it is not green but literally yellow: a bizarre choice made by a previous owner whose unusual decisions extend through the rest of the house too, but one fitting for a place that is far from the fresh, clean image that comes with sustainable housing.We hope to repaint the house this year. And we hope to make it a little more green throughout, too: my\u0026nbsppledge for 2020 is to find the ways that our somewhat behind-the-times building can be pulled into the 21st century\u0026nbspand do its bit to avoid any further damage to the environment.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMy partner and I lack both the means and the ability to undertake any grand plans like the installation of solar panels on the roof or gutting the walls. Instead, I will be looking for the easy wins that we can do ourselves or with minimal cost and input from the outside.We already try to achieve little gains in this respect – for example, I am a dogmatic avoider of leaving the big light on. But there is undoubtedly\u0026nbspmore we can do, both in terms of the house itself and the way we live in it.I\u0027m looking forward to exploring more environmentally friendly ways of dealing with waste, of considering the appliances in our house and the way we use them, of looking into the energy our house uses and how it can be minimised. I\u0027m hopeful too that we can do that without taking ourselves off the grid or avoiding the 21st century, not least because my job as technology editor means using the latest kit.Hopefully, what we will learn will not only help educate us and you the reader about how we can all make improvements, but also help show companies how they can better enable their customers to do so.There are plenty of people, like me, living in old and often rented accommodation where they have limited scope to make improvements. Those people are of course concerned about living without damaging the Earth, too, and so I hope to find ways we can all make our homes a little more sustainable together.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The demographic\u0026nbsptimebomb is well known — even if no one has adequately dealt with it — and the vast global debt burden of $188 trillion (£143 trillion) is unlikely to be an issue this year as low as interest rates remain low, as most forecasters expect.But deglobalisation is proving to be a major threat to the global economy. Societe\u0026nbspGenerale\u0026nbsp(Soc Gen) has warned that financial globalisation is at a “tipping point”, highlighting the possibility of stagnation and even a slow decline in production links between economies.‘Alarm bells ring’ as factory output falls at fastest rate in 7 yearsSoc Gen, which forecasts global growth slowing from 3.2 per cent to 3.1 per cent between 2020 and 2021, says financial globalisation has slowed significantly. Annual cross-border capital flows have decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to the peak in 2007.There is a similar problem with the trade in goods. According to the World Trade Organisation, its member states slapped protective measures on $747bn\u0026nbsp(£571bn) of goods in the year to October, a 27 per cent annual increase and the largest since 2012.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank also said its gauge of Brexit uncertainty in its monthly Decision Makers’ Panel survey fell to a six-month low in December.Brexit uncertainty will still bedevil the markets in 2020More than half (53 per cent) of firms reported that Brexit was one of their top three sources of uncertainty in December. That was slightly lower compared to the average of the previous three months. However, Brexit-related uncertainty remains well above its average since the referendum.Fears about renewed tensions between London and Brussels undermined the value of the pound. Sterling fell 0.4 per cent against the US dollar and 0.2 against the euro.The drop against the dollar wiped off some of the 7.9 per cent rise in the pound’s exchange rate in the final quarter of the year, which had made it the strongest currency pair in the 2019 rankings by Deutsche Bank.“Much of sterling’s gains came after prime minister Johnson and the EU agreed a new deal in October, and the gains in GBPUSD over the last three months mark the strongest quarterly performance since the second quarter of 2009,” said research analyst Henry Allen.Capital Economics, the London-based consultancy, believes the pound will end 2020 almost 4 per cent higher at $1.35 by the end of the year as the outlook for the UK economy brightens thanks to reduced political uncertainty and a large fiscal boost.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A keeper counts squirrel-monkeys at London Zoo during the annual stocktake.

Shopper numbers fell almost 9 per cent on Boxing Day, which used to be a traditional start of the sales, according to retail intelligence firm Springboard.“Consumers are increasingly using Boxing Day primarily for leisure purposes, going out to eat or to the cinema, but possibly combining this with a visit to retail stores rather than shopping being the main focus of the trip,” said Springboard\u0027s insights director Diane Wehrle.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The first (unauthorised) adaptation of Bram Stoker\u0027s Dracula is a masterful presentation of the Victorian fears the vampire represents - xenophobia, disease, female sexuality and death.Guillermo del Toro has made a career out of dreaming up all kinds of creatures – some nice, others not so – and the Reapers in Blade II fit firmly in the latter category. They’re a deadlier breed of vampire (yes, in this film you can be even more dead than the undead) and, perhaps even more terrifyingly, the lead carrier is played by Luke Goss.“You’ll never see anything like The Thing ever again,” John Carpenter once said of his 1982 sci-fi horror. Many critics at the time would have responded, “Good.” Upon its release, the film – which centres around a mysterious, malformed humanoid discovered buried in ice, that consumes and assimilates anything in its way – was met with a barrage of negative reviews. Critics decried it as “bereft, despairing and nihilistic”, but over time, those traits have become its greatest strengths. Plus, there are tentacles, slime and dismembered body parts.As mogwai, they\u0027re unbelievably cute. But feed them after midnight and you\u0027ll be faced with these slimy little terrors, with their triangular faces, sharp teeth and penchant for mayhem. (JS)There are few scenes more horrific than Jeff Goldblum completing his metamorphosis into the gloopy, eponymous fly, in Cronenberg\u0027s classic. Whether you see King Kong as a rampaging monster or a tragic antihero, the ape has become one of the most famous movie icons in history and has appeared in dozens of films, video games, comics and books since his debut in the original 1933 classic. (EH)820 The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954)This strange prehistoric beast from 1954’s Creature from the Black Lagoon lurks in the depths of a dark lake in the Amazonian jungle. It doesn’t take too kindly to a group of scientists’ attempts to capture it and bring it back to civilisation for testing. (EH)The Pale Man only appears in one scene in Pan’s Labyrinth, but has understandably been burned into the collective memories of everyone who’s seen it. A child-eating ghoul with loose skin and eyeballs lodged in his palms, he remains Guillermo Del Toro’s most disarming and terrifying creation.This slimy-skinned creature with an appetite for small children is yet another movie monster that emerges from the depths of a body of water – in this case the Han River in South Korea. In the 2006 film The Host, the strange amphibian kidnaps a local man’s daughter and the story follows his desperate attempts to rescue her. (EH)These little red-eyed furballs from outer space can eat you quicker than a school of piranhas and shoot darts from their forehead. Fun fact: a young  Leonardo DiCaprio appeared in Critters 3 (1991). (JS)1220 Little Shop of Horrors (1986)There is a silly sort of charm at the heart of The Little Shop of Horrors, which stars Rick Moranis as a nervous florist, and the voice of Levi Stubbs as a singing, man-eating plant called Audrey II. The film is more nerdy than nightmarish, and is all the better for it. (AP)OK, the monsters of Monsters, Inc – an animated Pixar film in which children’s screams generate the city’s power – are far less nightmarish than some of the entries here. Some of them, in fact, are downright cute – not least John Goodman’s blue-furred, gentle giant Sulley. But Randall Boggs, a conniving chameleon as slimy as his name suggests, is brilliantly creepy. (AP)Michael Keaton’s bio-exorcist turns the Deetz residence into a house of horrors after transforming into a leery stop-motion reptilian creature in a scene that, despite its placement in the middle of the Tim Burton comedy, remains a pretty unsettling watch. (JS)The creatures that terrorise Kevin Bacon can best be identified as land sharks. That\u0027s how writers SS Wilson and Brent Maddock pitched the idea to director Ron Underwood, who used his knowledge of nature (he was a documentary filmmaker for National Geographic at the time) to translate the monster into one hell of an on-screen terror. (JS)Although this creature, which crashes onto Earth inside a meteorite, is described as an alien amoeboidal entity, it is essentially a giant blob that rolls around town, devouring everybody in its wake. In other words, it’s not going to go down as one of the most creatively imagined monsters in cinema, but the fact it gets bigger with each person killed is a pretty scary thought. (JS)Sometimes a metaphor for nuclear war, but often a giant spiky-backed friend to all, Godzilla is both the scariest and loveliest of cinema’s monsters. Through 35 movies and countless video games, TV series and comic books, Godzilla has been as willing to crush skyscrapers with aplomb as he is eager to rescue humanity. He’s the kind of creature you’d want to bring home to your parents is what we’re saying, if you were in a scenario in which dating Godzilla was an option. (AW)Because it feels important to reiterate every once in a while to remind us of how good we once had it, there was once a film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger faced off against an invisible, dreadlocked alien in the jungle outside Guatemala. It was Predator, and it was terrifying. (AW)Not Frankenstein, as you will have been endlessly reminded by your teachers when you were 11 and reading Mary Shelley for the first time in English. Like many of the monsters on this list, Frankenstein’s Monster is also a master of transformation: sometimes a deformed mutant, other times incredibly charismatic – in a desperately-wants-to-eat-your-brain kind of way. Eternally spooky, however. (AW)The monsters at the centre of the Alien franchise are so terrifying because they’re oddly biological – all ooze and acid and jutting parts, with phallic things protruding out of them and shiny heads like the backs of cockroaches. They are grim, crawling around like interpretive dance students dressed in black latex and equally as terrifying. Thank God, then, for Sigourney Weaver, who has never met a Xenomorph she hasn’t been able to take down with a trusty flamethrower or through the use of a giant bit of wearable tech. If she’s not available, though… then the best of luck to you.

(JS)Although this creature, which crashes onto Earth inside a meteorite, is described as an alien amoeboidal entity, it is essentially a giant blob that rolls around town, devouring everybody in its wake. In other words, it’s not going to go down as one of the most creatively imagined monsters in cinema, but the fact it gets bigger with each person killed is a pretty scary thought. (JS)Sometimes a metaphor for nuclear war, but often a giant spiky-backed friend to all, Godzilla is both the scariest and loveliest of cinema’s monsters. Through 35 movies and countless video games, TV series and comic books, Godzilla has been as willing to crush skyscrapers with aplomb as he is eager to rescue humanity. He’s the kind of creature you’d want to bring home to your parents is what we’re saying, if you were in a scenario in which dating Godzilla was an option. (AW)Because it feels important to reiterate every once in a while to remind us of how good we once had it, there was once a film in which Arnold Schwarzenegger faced off against an invisible, dreadlocked alien in the jungle outside Guatemala. It was Predator, and it was terrifying. (AW)Not Frankenstein, as you will have been endlessly reminded by your teachers when you were 11 and reading Mary Shelley for the first time in English. Like many of the monsters on this list, Frankenstein’s Monster is also a master of transformation: sometimes a deformed mutant, other times incredibly charismatic – in a desperately-wants-to-eat-your-brain kind of way. Eternally spooky, however. (AW)The monsters at the centre of the Alien franchise are so terrifying because they’re oddly biological – all ooze and acid and jutting parts, with phallic things protruding out of them and shiny heads like the backs of cockroaches. They are grim, crawling around like interpretive dance students dressed in black latex and equally as terrifying. Thank God, then, for Sigourney Weaver, who has never met a Xenomorph she hasn’t been able to take down with a trusty flamethrower or through the use of a giant bit of wearable tech. If she’s not available, though… then the best of luck to you. (AW)“I have seen rapid declines in TV shows over seasons before. Never have I seen it over three episodes,” one Twitter user\u0026nbspwrote, with critic Helen O’Hara calling the conclusion “deeply silly.”“We’ll always have episode one,” another quipped, referencing the acclaimed premiere, while others branded the episode\u0026nbsp”horses***\u0026nbspand so boring” as well as “dreadful”.Find a collection of responses below.Dracula also starred Dolly Wells, Morfydd Clark and Lydia West.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Maybe in an attempt to avoid similar controversy to that which the comedian has courted in the past, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) has ordered the comedian to be on better behaviour\u0026nbspfor this year’s opening monologue.Will he listen? That remains to be seen – although much of the promotion of this year’s ceremony has been centred on the fact this will be Gervais’ fifth and final time as host, so he won’t exactly be looking to go out with a whimper.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGervais isn’t the only host to have cut down Hollywood’s elite with some shocking one liners, though. Both Tina Fey and Amy Poehler did so not too long ago – for three consecutive years, no less – and Seth Meyers had the tough task of hosting the year after the news of Harvey Weinstein’s harassment allegations came to light.Ahead of this year’s Golden Globes ceremony, we run through some of the most shocking jokes, ranging from one-liners about Leonardo DiCaprio,\u0026nbspGeorge Clooney and several about Mel Gibson.Click through the bellow gallery to see what made the listCreated with Sketch.

It seemed like everything this year was three-dimensional. Except the characters in The Tourist. I already feel bad about that joke. I tell you what, I’m jumping on the bandwagon because I haven’t even seen The Tourist. Who has?” There were a lot of big films that didn’t get nominated this year. Nothing for Sex and the City 2. No, I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster. Great job. Girls, we know how old you are. I saw one of you in an episode of Bonanza. “What you don’t know about Colin Firth is he’s very racist. I mean, really nasty stuff. I’ve also seen him punch a little blind kitten. Please welcome the evil Colin Firth. Last year, our next presenter won both the Golden Globe and the Oscar for her work in Black Swan. This year, she took some time out to have a baby. Consequently, she’s been nominated for nothing. Really pathetic. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton: a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought – allegedly. Nothing’s been proved.  “For his role in Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey lost 45 pounds. Or what actresses call, being in a movie.  The Wolf of Wall Street is another nominee tonight. I really loved the film, but some of it was too graphic. I mean, if I wanted to see Jonah Hill masturbate at a pool party, I’d go to one of Jonah Hill’s pool parties.”  “Gravity is nominated for Best Film. It’s the story of how George Clooney would rather float away into space and die than spend one more minute with a woman his own age.”  “Now, like a supermodel’s vagina, let’s say hello to Leonardo DiCaprio.”  Amal is a human rights lawyer who worked on the Enron case, was an adviser to Kofi Annan regarding Syria, and was selected to a three-person UN commission investigating rules of war violations in the Gaza Strip. So tonight, her husband is getting a lifetime achievement award.  “North Korea referred to The Interview as absolutely intolerable and a wanton act of terror. Even more amazing: not the worst review the movie got.”  Hello, I\u0027m Seth Rogen and I am currently trying to conceal a massive erection.All-female remakes are the big thing. There’s a female remake of Ghostbusters. There’s going to be a female remake of Ocean’s 11.

I’ve changed – not as much as Bruce Jenner. Obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year she’s had! She became a role model for trans-people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers. But you can’t have everything, can you? Not at the same time.  The excellent Spotlight has been nominated. The Catholic Church are furious about the film as it exposes that 5 per cent of all their priests have repeatedly molested children and been allowed to continue to work without punishment.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Gambling companies pay referral fees to intermediaries who can find new customers that may turn into lucrative regular players.Online gambling group 888 takes £15m punt on BetBrightTom Watson labels problem gambling as a ‘public health emergency’Will bookies millions to address problem gambling buy off critics?This week, the extent to which gambling companies’ multibillion-pound profits rely on problem gamblers was revealed in a report obtained , which showed that one firm collected 83 per cent of its deposits from just 2 per cent of its customers.A Google spokesperson said: “We support responsible gambling advertising and it’s important to us that people see useful and relevant ads in this area.\u0026nbsp“As such, we have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need a Labour government that will offer people hope of a better future.“However, that is only going to happen if Labour listens to people about what needs to change and how we can restore trust in our party as a force for good.”Sir Keir is regarded with suspicion by some Corbyn supporters, having pushed for the pro-Final Say referendum on Brexit they blame for Labour’s catastrophic defeat, and would be another London-based leader.But he said the case for a “bold and radical” Labour government was as important as ever, in an apparent attempt not to alienate left-wing members.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Things can only improve on the last four years of anger, ision and political paralysis.A period which should have been pivotal to our country saw it barely governed at all. That all changed at pm on December .Boris Johnson’s thumping election win gives us the greatest opportunity for radical renewal since at least .That means finally achieving Brexit  days from now and then, we hope, rapidly ­striking trade deals with Brussels and the world’s greatest economies.It means a dramatic, imaginative ­Budget to turbo-charge both those “left-behind” regions which voted Tory for the first time and the wider economy.We share too the  vision of our readers: For huge NHS investment to continue and a long-term social care solution be put in place.That tax breaks and rate cuts must renew our dilapidated High Streets and help small firms thrive and create jobs.That rough sleeping must be slashed, even ended. That wages must be driven up and food banks rendered redundant.That the Tories must continue striving for a cleaner environment without ­caving in to economy-wrecking panic.And we of course share the desire for a kinder, more united country — echoed by the open letter from faith, ­culture, sport and business leaders.The Sun is optimistic about that too.In fact we do not agree we have suffered a “decade of ision”. Yes, it was tough financially. But we were far from ided at, say, the  Olympics.The anger in our Parliament, offices, factories and homes was caused by Brexit, specically by some Remainers’ refusal to accept defeat, and by a Labour Party engulfed by the hostile hard-left.The Brexit heat is fast dissipating now. Boris’s triumph saw to that. Many Remainers are making their peace with it . . . and even seeing its opportunities.Which leaves but one obstacle to the national healing.No one has done more to ide us than Jeremy Corbyn, his thuggish, often anti-Semitic followers and his obnoxious media apologists.Their relentless hatred and dishonest demonisation of opponents toxied both political discourse and Labour’s election fortunes.Yet none of the contenders to replace Corbyn grasps this reality: They can remain a Twitter-obsessed, Tory-hating clique of middle-class Marxist posers calling each other “comrade” but disconnected from working people.Or be viable, mainstream contenders for Government. But not both.Will they make the right choice  It’s January , , and we live in hope.We are far more sure that Britain, fully independent for the first time in  years, will enjoy a golden decade in the ’s.Happy New Year to you all! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whichever box we ticked in the election, millions of us vote green with our lestyles.A recent survey of Sun readers showed  per cent recognise climate change is real and that  per cent of us worry more about our environmental impact now than they did five years ago.And  per cent of Sun readers want to make their habits greener still.Some of them make their voices heard.Retired receptionist Eileen Webster, , says “climate change is the big issue facing the next generation”, while Anna Lubecka, , demands new PM Boris Johnson, “start making good plans for climate change”.Attitudes to environmentalism have shted so much that being green is now no longer the preserve of lentil-munching hippies and Swampy, it is totally mainstream.No trendy bar would now dare put plastic straws in their cocktails.We’ve all got used to carrying Love Island-style water bottles and happily adopted reusable coffee cups. This year they pulled off a plastic-free Glastonbury, despite a few hiccups.We’ve long stopped grumbling about taking our own bags to the supermarket and got used to stuffing our pockets with them when we leave the house.So now in England, the average person uses less than a tenth of the number of single-use plastic bags than we did five years ago. Only around ten a year, compared to  in .As electric cars have improved, we’ve all been seduced — and not just by Tesla’s new “bulletproof” Cybertruck. Overall, demand for electric cars has jumped, with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders finding that this November alone electric car sales leaped by . per cent, with more than three times as many new battery-electric vehicles registered as in the same month in .Nowhere  is it clearer that green has become the new black than in fashion, where criticism of fast fashion has led to trends for vintage, second hand and renting rather than buying.On the high street, companies such as HM have launched their “conscious collection” , fashion bible Vogue has championed sustainable designs, while French President Emmanuel Macron’s “fashion pact” — presented at the G summit and intended to make the industry more sustainable — has been signed by more than  brands, including Nike, Zara and Gap.All these changes prove how far we have come and the impact Greta has had.Hearing her, strong and calm, on Radio ’s Today programme this week, what struck me is that now another change is needed.This time a sht not in our actions, but in how we approach the environmental debate.It’s not beliefs but attitudes that need to change. Until now, environmental issues have been too isive.Butwe want real change we’ve got to move beyond blame.It puts people off environmental issues when campaigners hector and shame them.When wealthy celebrities such as Sir David Attenborough criticise normal people for taking holidays with cheap flights, or actress Emma Thompson jets back from America to harass normal people driving to work.In the same way Extinction Rebellion threatens to lose potential supporters when it starts fights with commuters trying to board their morning train or cause mayhem in central London.The real danger is that by being so aggressive, these green campaigners risk putting people off.Greta seems to know this. She is much calmer than she used to be when speaking in public.Rather than getting angry or emotional, instead she has stressed the importance of just, “listening to the scientists”.As usual, we could learn from her.The reality is most people want to be green.We are all concerned about global warming, pollution in the seas and the kind of planet we are creating for our grandkids. But you can’t shame people into doing something.Diesel drivers — especially White Van Man — shouldn’t be harassed just for getting to work. I’m sure they would buy more environmentally friendly vehiclesthey could afford to.Likewise, no one should be shamed for taking a flight — who knows what other measures they might be taking, such as living in a carbon neutral home What the planet needs least is more fighting. Instead we need grown-up debate.The answer to the climate crisis isn’t to criticise each other — it’s to work together to make real change. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We need contact — and not just emotional — but physical.There’s even a psychological term for it, skin hunger.People are responding to this tech-driven disconnect by seeking out physical contact in any way they can.The most obvious example is the rise of hugging.There’s a lot more hugging as a greeting between men than there used to be, even between sporting opponents.And what on earth happened to the stand-offish Brits  Great British Bake Off contestants spend nearly as much time holding hands and wrapping their arms around each other as they do baking.We have become so hungry for touch that we don’t even need a human partner.The odds are that someone you know will have received a weighted blanket for Christmas.It is essentially a duvet cover filled with plastic or glass pellets or beads.Manufacturers say the even pressure they exert on your body promotes the release of well-being chemical serotonin and sleep hormone melatonin, while reducing stress-related hormone cortisol.In plain language we’re talking about feeling the comfort and security of being cradled, evenit’s by a blanket rather than in the arms of a loved one.For those who want to take the experience of being hugged to a whole new level, Otonamaki, the Japanese practice of adult swaddling, will become popular in .After getting into a foetal position, the client is bound tightly in sheets, then gently rocked for  minutes.I ran across a tweet not long ago that read: “My phone just said, ‘Welcome home’, and I instinctively replied, ‘I love you’. Then I realised I meant it.”We may be interacting with our fellow humans less often, but we’re more than making up for it with digital interactions, even to the point of developing feelings for these devices.As our devices get smarter and master the intricacies of natural language processing, we will increasingly see them as confidants, friends and even romantic partners.Already people are interacting with chatbots instead of flesh-and-blood therapists.And we’re seeing all sorts of digital apps promising to improve our mental health, from Moodfit and MoodMission to Happy.As developers figure out how to make our smart devices ever more personable, it doesn’t take a soothsayer to recognise that a global population increasingly suffering from loneliness and disconnectedness will find solutions of a sort in these gadgets.The desire for clean air in cities will not only lead to pricier houses on less polluted streets but tourists will give up city breaks for holidays in the country, where the air is good.As living in places with clean air becomes a luxury with a high price tag, expect new takes on face masks to become a must-have item for people in cities and a race towards rural living.Expect an explosion of products, from vegan leather to plant-based burgers and articial wood.If you buy a vegan burger and cook it at home, you have consumed a burger made with eight times less water and CO than a conventional beef burger.These sorts of products may be described as “fake” but the feelings people get of having made an ethically better choice are very real.Uncertainty begets fear, so look out for a rise in preppers — survivalists preparing for Armageddon.In the US, prepping is mainstream enough for Costco to sell a £, one-year stockpile of survival food for four.Survivalists are at the extreme end of the bunker trend.More mainstream are the millions who aren’t worried enough to go all-out prepper but still view the outside world as a threat.Driven by concerns about personal security and terrorism, CCTV covering public and commercial spaces is becoming a global norm.London is sixth in the world for TV surveillance, the only non-Chinese city in the top eight.And sales of home video surveillance on smartphones, courtesy of Google Nest, Ring and Wyze Cam, are booming.The global market is expected to rise from £billion to £billion by .Expect the self-tracking trend to run and run.For more and more people, there’s something irresistible about gadgets that put statistics to common everyday activities.For things that can’t yet be tracked automatically, they can input data manually — MyMoodTracker for emotions, MyNetDiary for nutrition and PoopLog for toilet visits.Google announced it intended to buy Fitbit for nearly £billion, prompting some to say they will ditch their device out of concern that Google will sell their health data to insurance companies.But rather than wait to buy third-party data, insurance companies are already getting into the game.: Single, professional women will become the new free-spending yuppies.: Publishes a study of the soft modern male, who she described as “metrosexual man”.: Predicts “sleep is the new sex” and “clean eating”.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh. Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.DOMINIC CUMMINGS is spot on: What this country needs is some more nerds.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many of our New Year resolutions are about dieting and fitness. We set our new Apple watches and Fitbits to unrealistic targets – and beat ourselves up in front of the mirror when we don’t hit them. Surely we all already know that fad diets don’t work. And that we won’t stick to running a mile a day for the next few months. Heck,diet and fitness regimes worked we’d be a nation of happy, healthy, rosy-cheeked utopians. The very word regime has scary militaristic overtones. All of this talk of health and weight, particularly at this time of year, merely sets us up to fail. Because while we are all gaining inches and pounds gradually as a nation the latest stats tell us we are also developing an ­epidemic of eating disorders. Hospital admissions have risen by more than a third across all ages for anorexia. The most common age of sufferers was  to  last year. There were ten cases among boys and six among girls of nine and under. This suggests we don’t know how to handle our relationship with food and we are ­developing this imbalance so early in our lives that our kids are destined to be either too fat, obsessed with yo-yo dieting, or in and out of anorexia and bulimia clinics during their lives. Meanwhile, as a Sunday People ­investigation reveals, some websites are ­entreating us to follow diets designed to help us shed pounds no matter how extreme our weight-loss goals may be.

The NHS is there to bring le, to offer care and dignity when we leave the world, and to support our loved ones when tragedy hits.

Throughout the election, Boris Johnson repeatedly denied that the NHS would be up for sale.

The Shadow Brexit Secretary revealed his leadership bid speaking exclusively to the Sunday Mirror and admits Labour face an “uphill struggle” against Boris Johnson ’s Commons majority.But he says the party must hold the Tory government to account for the promises they made before the election. The Shadow Brexit Secretary will  launch his campaign during a visit to Brexit-backing Stevenage. Tonight he released a video featuring Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered Steven Lawrence - telling the story of his career including his work as a legal advisor to the National Union of Mineworkers , environmental activists and people fighting the poll tax. “I’m proud to be announcing by candidacy for the Labour leadership in the Sunday Mirror today,” he said.  “Over the coming weeks, I’m looking forward to getting back on the campaign trail and talking to people from across the country about how Labour can rebuild and win. “Britain desperately needs a Labour Government. We need a Labour Government that will offer people hope of a better future. “However, that is only going to happenLabour listens to people about what needs to change and how we can restore trust in our party as a force for good.” Sir Keir became the fth Labour MP to formally throw their hat in the ring for the top job. Friday night saw both Jess Phillips and Lisa Nandy launch their campaigns. Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry and Shadow Economics Minister Clive Lewis had already officially declared. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally favoured on the left of the party, is still “seriously considering” whether to run for the leadership - as is party chairman Ian Lavery, who is also close to Mr Corbyn.But London MP David Lammy ruled himself out of the race on Saturday. He said: “I’m committed to playing my full part in opposition, but we need the candidate best placed to unite our party’s factions so we can win the country’s trust.” Ms Phillips visited the Bury North constituency that fell from Labour to the Tories to meet former supporters who did not back the party in the last election.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSitting next to a startled rape victim, Lisa Nandy looked in to her eyes and made a solemn promise to make her le better. Left emotionally and physically scarred, the young woman faced having her benefits stopped unless she agreed to a physical medical exam which proved she was unable to work. Enraged, Nandy says it fuelled the seminal moment when, as a new MP in , she first found her voice. The Labour Leader contender, , said: “This young lady had been traumatised by the horric rape she had suffered. The way she’d been treated by the benefits system had compounded that. “When she told me she had to undergo a medical exam I just thought ‘over my dead body’. “There’s something about Parliament that can be very intimidating when you first arrive. You need to find your confidence really quickly, otherwise you can’t make change and it was her terrible story which made me find my voice.  “I told Teresa May thatshe got one more letter asking her for an exam I would raise hell and the issue was sorted. She was given two years without being sent any more letters and got the head space she needed to recover. “I didn’t feel apologetic about taking up time or forcing things onto the agenda. In many ways this young woman made me feel I didn’t have a right not to. That was a game changer for me.” Nandy has thrown her hat into the ring as Jeremy Corbyn ’s replacement. Today it’s hard to imagine that the chatty, humorous mother-of-one ever struggled with voicing her views Boris Johnson is not to be trusted, regional devolution of powers is a good thing, the north’s transport system needs improving. Above all , Labour needs a new focus after it’s “devastating” defeat to the Tories and, living in its Northern heartlands, she is the woman “with skin in the game”. She says she will not move to Londonshe wins the race . “If the Labour leader cannot live in Wigan and travel for work in London, then there’s something wrong with Labour and the country.” Like many female MPs, Nandy has been subject to misogynistic and political abuse but also about her Indian heritage. Her father Dipak is a Marxist academic who helped draw up the race relations act – meaning she has also been subjected to racism. She refuses to be cowed by threats saying: “I won’t let them stop me. “What is the alternative for this countrypeople, particularly women , can be hounded out of public le through violence, abuse and fear ” She lives with her partner, PR man Andy Collis, and their four-year-old son. When Nandy took a soft Brexit approach to Europe, advocating we leave the European Union but keep close ties with our neighbours, she spent three years being pummelled by abuse. She said: “I was getting it from every side. Those who voted remain told me I was a traitor for wanting Brexit, while those on the other side said I had thrown democracy down the river.”  Nandy, who carries a panic alarm and has panic buttons in her home like many women MPs, said: “The abuse over the last three years has been astronomical some of it misogynistic, some of it deeply sexist, some downright abusive and some threatening. “When I was first selected I had notes through my door and letters to the office, saying ‘you need to get out of this country’ and ‘you need to leave politics’. “Right-wingers were at the centre of it and they tried to slash my car tyres but got my neighbours instead. “Some people wrote on message boards that I was a secret Muslim and planned to tear down the Anvil pub in Wigan and put up a statue of a woman in a burqa. “It gathered some traction because people were emailing askingI was Muslim. I’d write back saying ‘I’m an atheist but I have respect for every religion.’ I think they eventually came a cropper when other people started posting on these messages that I often spent my Fridays nights in the Anvil! She admits being shaken when fellow MP Jo Cox was murdered. “I sat down with my partner and we had a conversation in which we said ‘is it worth it ’, she says. “He feels very strongly that it is because, in the end, do you want to bring your kids up in a world where we allow these people to win ”  She seems mystied as to how anti-semitism sentiment in her own party got out of control. If elected Leader, she will move quickly to stamp it out. She was shadow cabinet for Energy and Climate Change in  when Bradford MP Naz Shah was caught up in a row over anti-Jewish social media posts. Jeremy Corbyn caused tensions by refusing to suspend her straight away.  Nandy said: “I went from pillar to post over a course of  hours trying to get the Party to take it seriously and couldn’t get anywhere with it, despite some people on the inside trying to help me.” AskedCorbyn is to blame for Labour Party issues Nandy refuses to directly criticise the hand that fed her on her rise to possible leadership. She has known Corybn since she was a -year-old researcher for MP Neil Gerrard. She says: “I don’t think the Labour Party is anti-Semitic because most members hate racism as much as poverty. Don’t forget it’s working class people, often Labour Party members, who have driven the far right out of town over and over again over decades. They hate racism and they feel badly let down.” Nandy left her Shadow Cabinet position in  when it became clear to her Labour in-fighting was going to rage on between the Corybnites and their rivals. She says: “I got a very strong steer the factional war was never going to end and they were going to fight it out until one side had won and the other had lost.” While her father, , is a leading academic light, Nandy credits her mum Luise, , for being the most inspirational person in her le. The couple split when Nandy was seven, but the MP hates the term single parent household “because I had two parents, they just happened to live in dferent houses.” One of her earliest memories involves politics when she went out canvassing and delivering leaflets with her mum, who stood as a local councillor.

It is alleged Cypriot police “threatened” the girl to make her withdraw claims of an attack by  Israeli youths in the resort of Ayia Napa. But the retraction saw her convicted instead on a charge of “public mischief”. And that means she could end up back in Nicosia jail – where she spent more than a month awaiting her trial. Michael Polak, director of campaign group Justice Abroad, said: “We fear a custodial sentence. “She has spent four and a half weeks in Nicosia prison already.  “To go back would be so damaging for her. Some of the prison guards treated her badly. “She’s never been in trouble with the law before, she was just a teenager about to go off to university. For a -year-old to share a cell with eight others is a nightmare.But for someone with post-traumatic stress disorder, that is the last place she should be.” An appeal against her conviction could take up to three years.

Officials took the bodies to Malaga Airport in three funeral hearses on Saturday morning so they could be flown back to the UK  days after the Christmas Eve holiday tragedy that claimed their lives. Gabriel Diya, , and his children Comfort, nine, and Emmanuel-Prince, , lost their lives after taking their first holiday dip at their pool on the Club La Costa World resort near Fuengirola, Spain. Police have described the incident as a “tragic accident” caused by the victims’ lack of swimming skills. But Christian preacher Mr Diya’s widow Olubunmi, who ed to the UK with her surviving daughter Favour, , last Saturday, has hired a Spanish lawyer after claiming her loved ones could all swim and there was something wrong with the pool. An investigation led by a court in Fuengirola is ongoing. Police tests have shown up no anomalies with the pool. Mrs Diya’s lawyer Javier Toro has said he could press for new tests on the pool done by engineers he would hire for the job once he has read through the police report.  It was not clear today when the funerals of Mr Diya and his children would take place. The plane carrying their bodies was expected to reach the UK late afternoon. Mr Diya, who lived with his family in Charlton, south east London, was a pastor at a branch in the capital of the Redeemed Christian Church of God . Pastor Agu Irukwu, chairman of the RCCG board of trustees in the UK, told thenewspaper overnight he had spent time with Mrs Diya and she had been grieving but showing “grace and dignity. He said: “My we and I were really amazed at the grace and dignity she is exhibiting at a time like this. “We left there thinking we had been in the presence of a remarkable woman.”  Heartbroken Favour Diya told police after the tragedy she had come close to suffering the same fate as her siblings after “sliding towards the deep part” of the pool which was in the middle. She admitted to never having swum in areas where she was out of her depth but told cops who interviewed her when she was askedshe could remember any suction or current in the pool: “The water was moving but I don’t know how to explain it.” Although Favour told police she was not aware the deepest part of the pool was in the middle, the children’s mum insisted to investigators she had told her youngest girl Comfort.  In a statement released three days after the tragedy through her lawyer, Mrs Diya said: “I would like to thank all those who have sent their condolences and supported our family during this extremely dficult time following the tragic deaths of Gabriel, Comfort and Praise-Emmanuel. “Our family are utterly heartbroken by the events last Tuesday but we are comforted and strengthened by our strong faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. “We are deeply shocked, saddened and struggling to come to terms with their passing.

They even stood at opposite sides of the football pitch whenever they watched youngest son Adam play. They also managed to get through two of their boys’ weddings without saying a word to each other. But it was tragedy that brought them back together, with Jan consoling Rob over the loss of his second we.  It made the pair, now , realise le was too short for their rt to go on – and that the love sparked when they met at a Woolworths store as teenagers was still burning. Rob says: “Jan was my first love and we will be growing old together as I definitely can’t afford another wedding – or a orce.” And Jan, who had the ceremony she dreamed of second time around in , says: “We married in a registry office first time. This time I wore a big white dress and we got married in a church. “Our children,  grandchildren and one great-grandchild were with us. It was perfect and I’m back with my best friend.” The lovebirds first met in  in the days of flares and s at a Woollies store in Erdington, Birmingham. Jan worked in the office and Rob in the stockroom. Within a year they were dating. Jan recalls: “Rob and I were just . I was a cashier and he was pretty much my bodyguard, going round the tills with me collecting money twice a day. “He asked me out at a works Christmas dance. Our first date was watching a film we hadn’t realised was X-rated and there were quite a few men wearing flasher macs in the cinema. “We had to leave but we didn’t stop laughing.” The couple moved in together at . “I fell pregnant and our parents weren’t happy but it was planned,” Jan said. “We were excited about the future. “We got married soon after I turned  in September . “I had a white dress, but not a proper wedding one, and I was five- and-a-half months pregnant.”  Daughter Cara was born on Christmas Day and the couple went on to have Lee, now , and Adam, now . But  years into their marriage, cracks started to show. Jan was made redundant from her job in Boots and started working shts at another company. She and Rob barely saw each other. She says: “I absolutely loved working at Boots and I think I had a bit of a breakdown after being made redundant. “Rob was always saying he didn’t see enough of me in my new job. I was working until  at night. We started arguing about that a lot and I just got fed up. I left and we didn’t speak properly again for years.” The couple separated in  and Rob filed for a orce, which came through in . Both met new partners and Rob remarried two-and-a-half years after their split. Rob says: “I never thought I’d find love again, but I did. My second we was an absolutely wonderful woman.” Although Rob and Jan’s paths crossed occasionally, they didn’t speak for years.  Jan says: “Adam played football and we’d both go and watch him, standing at opposite sides of the pitch. It was strange. We even made it through two of our sons’ weddings without talking. “Lee was married first. Rob and I were both with dferent people and just sat in dferent places. “When our son Adam had a wedding reception, again we didn’t talk to each other.“The only time we ever did wasafter we lost a grandchild. I was in hospital, crying.“Rob put his arm around me and said, ‘It’ll be OK, sweetheart’. I don’t know why we never talked.” That all changed in  when their daughter Cara told her mum that Rob’s we had died of oian cancer. The tragedy broke the ice.  “I gave him a call and offered my condolences and said I was there for himhe needed me,” says Jan. “A couple of weeks later, he gave me a call and we chatted for  minutes and arranged to see each other for a coffee. “I found it was like being back with my best friend. It was so bizarre – we picked up where we had left off  years earlier.” Rob says: “It was wonderful.

Party goers complained of vomiting and diarrhea, as well as painful stomach cramps, with some claiming they were sent home from work. Charlotte Bareham was one of those who fell aposviolentlyapos ill after attending and said she aposcouldnapost keep anything downapos. She suffered sickness and diarrhea on Thursday and noticed others on social media complaining about similar symptoms. Dan Perrin, events director at the club, says the illness is a mystery since the venue doesnapost serve beer on tap nor food.Since the outcry on Twitter from punters and parents concerned over their youngsteraposs illness, Mr Perrin has confirmed the venue is investigating complaints fully.He said: Feedback from our customers is our number one priority so of course this is something we take very seriously and will look into fully over the coming week. We will say however that Sugar Hut club does not serve food, bar snacks or draft beers wines etc. It is therefore quite dficult to find any common denominator at Sugar Hut at the present time but we will be speaking to those who have messaged and emailed us to try and investigate further. He also noted that the illness could have come from some other source as we all live in the same area.Charlotte, who had waited for hours in a queue before getting into the club, told The Sun : I woke up Thursday morning feeling very unwell. I was violently sick and throughout the day I couldn’t keep anything down.I had sickness and diarrhoea which I thought might have been food poisoning or a stomach bug and then someone I know sent me a screenshot of tweets they’d seen about people falling ill after attempting the New Year’s Eve event at Sugar Hut.  The cause of the sickness remains unknown, but both those who drank at the venue and those who didnapost have claimed to have fallen ill. Some say they still feel sick and have had today off work too. Niamh Mullane, from Gidea Park, attended the party with her boyfriend and a number of close friends. The -year-old said: I was drinking vodka and lemonade. I was fine until yesterday midday when I started being sick and so has my boyfriend and three of my close friends.

Word of the latest closures was spread by members of the public who posted photos of store closure signs in shop windows on social media. However, in many cases HMV has not made any public announcements. The outlets affected are in Leeds, Reading, Plymouth, the Bullring in Birmingham, Worcester, Bury St Edmunds, Grimsby and Nuneaton. The future of the following stores is currently unknown as HMV seeks to strike a deal with landlords: Bristol Cribbs, Edinburgh Ocean Terminal, Glasgow Braehead, Merryhill and Sheffield Meadowhall. If unsuccessful, they could shut.Reading’s HMV store in The Oracle launched a closing down sale on January , and closing down posters were put up in the mall. However, it is unclear whether the store is closing down for good or whether it’s relocating. Plymouth’s Drake Circus HMV is making way for a fresh retailer, leaving the centre on January  and re-opening in the former Maplin store in nearby Cornwall Street, also in the heart of the city centre.  One disappointed shopper wrote on Twitter : “My heart dropped when I saw the Closing sign, then realised they’re just moving, sad to see the store go by glad Plymouth will still have a HMV! #hmv” .

The Dogs Trust is appealing for more foster carers to come forward as its Freedom Project enters its th year.

Many victims will not leave their homes without knowing their pet is safe. Josie , from Yorkshire, used the Freedom Project to get both herself and her dog Mia away from her violent partner. She said: “I was experiencing domestic abuse and it got to the point where I knew I needed to leave. “Mia was really frightened of him. When he was around and kicking at doors, she would hide under the table. “He would hurt her to get at me. He even once tried to strangle Mia – she could quite easily have been killed. “It was hard to find someone to look after her and I didn’t want my son to lose his dog on top of losing everything .  I just didn’t know what to do.”  As she was preparing to leave her partner, Josie contacted Women’s Aid, which gave her information about the Freedom Project. “If they’d not told me about it, I ­probably wouldn’t have left and would still be in that situation,” she said. “I knew that she had been looked after. As soon as we were reunited, she fell straight back into family le with us.” A spokeswoman for the Dog’s Trust said: “Many refuges are not in a position to accept pets so, in many cases, people experiencing domestic abuse are unable to leave their home until they know there is somewhere safe for their dog.

Matthew Siddorn died at  years old after at least three known previous suicide attempts. Vicky Siddorn, from Bebington, Wirral, lost her son Matthew in April . Matthew left behind an identical twin brother, Daniel. The -year-old mum said Matthew was a happy, content and mischievous baby who did everything with his twin. Speaking to the Liverpool ECHO, Vicky said: Matthew was born exactly  minutes after his brother and Daniel never let him forget that. They were born four weeks early with no problems, he was just a lovely baby very content, slept right through at three weeks. Just a lovely baby, happy little boy, dead mischievous. The mum-of-three said her son excelled throughout school, but had a couple of wobbles when he was around -years-old. She added: After Matt died I have since found out that he had a couple of wobbles when he was about , but went to the doctor so he knew to ask for help. They asked himhe wanted to be referred to CAMHS but everything settled down. I am hearing voices and I am seeing a figure and itaposs telling me Iaposve got to hurt myself The former Wirral Grammar student earned a place to study Geology at Leicester University in September  - but just a few months into his first year, Vicky received a distressing phonecall while she was at work. The store healthcare assistant said she answered the phone to her son in February , telling the ECHO: I had been in work and Matthew had left a message - he was upset and distressed, so I phoned him back. He got really upset and he was crying and he said aposI need help mumapos, so I said aposokay tell meapos and he told me he had been hurting himself. He said aposI am hearing voices and I am seeing a figure and itaposs telling me Iaposve got to hurt myself or itaposs going to do stuff to my family or the people I love, Iaposm scared.apos  The -year-old told her son to come home and they visited their family GP who referred Matthew to mental health services. Vicky said due to her sonaposs conscientious nature he went back to university, but came straight back for his appointment at St Catherineaposs Hospital in Tranmere. Only  at the time, Matthew had started to self-harm, which Vicky said he was very open about with his family. He also kept a journal of his thoughts where he drew the shape he was seeing and described where he was hearing voices, which he took to the appointment. However, Vicky claims her son was only in the appointment for around  minutes. She said: I askedhe wanted me to go in with him and he said he was fine, he had his book with him. So I dropped him off and the distance in my car from my house to St Catherineaposs is less than  minutes. I literally dropped him off, he walked in and I went home and made myself a coffee. I was at home for a maximum of  minutes and I got a call from him saying he was done. The mum asked Matthew whether he had been diagnosed, given medication or a follow-up appointment. However, she claims Matthew was told he was tired and could go back to university despite showing his journal. Vicky said despite it being a little against their will Matthew went back to university and told his mumhe felt down or depressed he would visit the doctor there.  Matthewaposs first suicide attempt - a hysterical call from his twin brother and a race to hospital A week after ing to university in September , Vicky received a hysterical phone call from her son Daniel who told her his twin brother had tried to kill himself. She said: It was am and Daniel rang hysterically crying and he could not get the words out and said Matthew had tried to kill himself. One of Matthewaposs friends had tried to contact us, but weaposre ex-directory and they couldnapost get our home phone number so managed to get Danielaposs number. Vicky and her husband Steve drove straight to the hospital in Leicester, where Matthew had discharged himself due to being -years-old. She told her son he needed to come home and be under the care of family doctors and Wirral. The -year-old added: I kept blubbing and thinking the NHS will save him and thinking we will do this, we will get him help, look at me Iaposve had [depression] for nearly  years and Iaposm fine. He was just really despondent and hollow, its hard to describe until you look into their eyes. Obviously I had looked into Matthewaposs eyes for nearly  years and he always had a future, a plan, uni and loved his le and wanted to study in America. Mental health services in Wirral were contacted by the familyaposs GP, however at this point Vicky claims they were reassured the teenager didnapost have a mental health illness despite Matthew having auditory hallucinations and having made a suicide attempt, as well as self-harming. Matthew went back to Leicester where he had regular visits from doctors and counsellors, reassuring his mum he understood the gravity of his suicide attempt. Vicky said: I was a constant bag of nerves. I was having about three hours of sleep a night, I was permanently waiting for the phone to go, but I told myself Iaposve got to learn to calm down. Matthewaposs second suicide attempt - a message from his uni mates and a suicide letter left behind On Halloween , Vicky received a message from one of her sonaposs university friends saying Matthew had attempted suicide for the second time. Vicky said he pre-planned and researched his second attempt, leaving him in a secure unit in hospital. The mum-of-three also found a suicide letter. Vicky and her husband told Matthew he needed to quit university andhome to the Wirral for good. She said: We decided he had to come home and I need to be able to monitor him and go to meetings with him and he knew he needed too as well, he said aposyes I know I need to get better.apos Upon theirhome, Vicky said she phoned their GP again and made an emergency appointment with mental health services right away. The mum claims her son had an hour long appointment at Clatterbridge Hospital.  She added: I remember it being an hour as because I took a really heavy book thinking Iaposd be there for ages and looking at my watch. He came out and he was given no medication, they said he had no mental health illness and there didnapost really seem to be anything much. They said right you need to make these plans, things to look forward to. As December  rolled around, Vicky claims her son was insistent on helping his dad out at his grandmotheraposs house, only later to find out Matthew had hidden items there. The -year-old said Matthew walked the dog with her to work and they had arrangements where she would call her son to check in. She said: We had these little arrangements and I was only up the road and he seemed to be starting to look like he wanted to make plans for the future. We were still very cautious of him though and we thought mental health services were aware of him and he was seeing people. I know people are going to say - why didnapost you put him private care and I beat myself up everyday that we didnapost re-mortgage our house and that I didnapost force my way into the room into one of those meetings. Matthewaposs third suicide attempt - a worrying Facebook post and a call to police In December  Matthew  posted a cryptic message on Facebook, which a friend in Leicester spotted and managed to ring Merseyside Police before it was deleted. Matthew had made his third suicide attempt. His mum said: I was in work and my neighbours came up and said aposwe donapost want you to get too distressedapos and the minute they said that my stomach just dropped. Police had broken the door down and my boss drove me to our house. Itaposs like I revert to being a small child and perhaps a lot parents who lose children do this, you revert to wanting to be  years old again and want to run away to the park because youaposre so scared. Matthew wasnapost in his family home, but Vicky noticed the keys to her mother-in-laws house were missing. A nearby traffic officer drove to the house where he noticed blood. Matthew was found next to the fire in his grandmotheraposs house, sat on the sofa and waiting to die. Vicky said: I remember thinking now I really am scared and I donapost think anyone can save him now and then I started losing a little faith. I donapost think they understood the urgency - it was his third attempt. The -year-old claims her son was left in AE with no security in place and was left with a kne and fork. Vicky said: They had left him with the curtains that go round the bed and thick bedsheets at the end of the bed and I was sitting opposite him and I saw him look at those sheets and look at the curtain rail for a long time.  I thought I know what he is going to dohe is allowed to, he is going to do something. We had quite big discussions about it, which is pretty dark - having a conversation about your child trying to kill themself. Itaposs not a conversation you should have but then it should be at the same time. He was always very honest and open. The zone you go into he described it as a tunnel when the pain got too much and itaposs like a fog which takes over and you just do it. If it clears a little it and the pain lessens a little bit and people start talking to you, you push it away. He told me because I wanted to know, he said it was like having loads of Matthews and him - the Matthew who wants to get well canapost get out. Where is this place you think we can keep him safe  Vicky claims that a member of the mental health team arrived and said they would assess him in the morning. His shoes had been removed and the family were told security would bring him backhe tried to leave the hospital - but there were no constant checks. The next day, Vicky brought a four-page suicide note Matthew had written in to his assessment. Vicky claims she and her husband were initially denied access to the meeting but were eventually allowed to be present after insisting they should be there. The family told mental health services they couldnapost look after Matthew on their own and he needed professional help, but claim they were asked aposwhere is this place you think we can keep him safe apos Matthewaposs parents suggested the psychiatric unit at Clatterbridge Hospital, but said they were told once again he was not mentally ill and had to take him home. Mental health services agreed to contact the home team for Matthew to receive visits. Vicky claims when the home team visited they promised they could give medication and section Matthewneeded. A -hour helpline was  also provided and the family started to feel they were being taken seriously. However, she claims the home team only visited three times before Matthew was discharged without telling his parents - with his third appointment allegedly lasting five minutes. Vicky also claims Matthew was not given any medication, a diagnosis or the chance to see a psychiatrist, but was given five sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy . It was recommended that Matthew visit the gym and consider ing to university. She said: I would take him to the gym and outside because I was petried he was going to leave and go somewhere. We would talk a lot about his illness together, he said he had constant pain in his head and had no zest for le. At the end of February , Vicky managed to get Matthew to see the familyaposs GP, as she believed her son was planning another suicide attempt. Their doctor urgently requested for Matthew to see a psychiatrist, writing in a letter aposI can no longer guarantee his safety.apos Vicky claims the request was rejected, but Matthew had one final appointment at Clatterbridge for  minutes. The mum alleges she was once again told her son did not have a mental health illness because Matthew told them he wasnapost going to end his le. Itaposs awful to see police tape over your childaposs bedroom door After three suicide attempts in just a few months, Matthew took his own le on April ,  - his fourth known attempt. Vicky said: He killed himself on April ,  and itaposs awful to see police tape over your childaposs bedroom door. He died on his own in his bedroom - that breaks my heart.

Emma Langford, , has admitted attacking BA staff on the flight to Cape Town in South Africa, punching the manager and kicking another in the back of the legs while screaming: “You have a massive ar*e.” She faces jail and must wear an anti-booze bracelet after her case was adjourned so the court could seek evidence she is seeking treatment for her alcoholism. During the incident, the mum-of-two had pulled out trays of stowed plates and glasses, causing them to shatter on the floor and cutting another member of staff before pummeling cabin crew. She eventually had to be restrained with the help of an off-duty police officer on the flight before being carried off the plane when it touched down in Cape Town. Langford had previously pleaded guilty to charges of three assaults, criminal damage, being drunk on an aircraft, and behaving in a threatening manner towards cabin crew. She faces up to two years imprisonment. Isleworth Crown Court heard how Langford, as part of matters relating to the custody of her two young sons, is now accompanied by a woman who observes her  hours a day and lives in her Old Baising, Hampshire home to ensure she does not drink alcohol. The -year-old is also to wear a SCRAM bracelet, a device that is able to detect alcohol in the system every half an hour.  Both the prosecutor and defence sought to adjourn the matter for a pre-sentence report to be completed and for the court to receive a letter from her psychiatrist. Prosecutor Douglas Adams said: “Ms Langford was on a British Airways flight to Cape Town, South Africa, when she assaulted three members of the cabin crew, broke crockery and glassware, and behaved in a threatening way to several members of the cabin crew. “She was flying to South Africa to attend a rehabilitation centre to seek treatment for her addiction. “She has two recent convictions for drinking and driving.” Guy Wyatt, defending Langford, said: “It’s a mystery why no one prior to this hearing made a pre-sentence report.  “There are mental health dficulties and a serious history of alcohol abuse at play here. “It’s my application for a full pre-sentence report to be completed. I acknowledge the case law is severe. It makes it clear that it’s a rare thing for anything other than a custodial sentence. “An immediate custodial sentence is the starting point. “This lady had a plan to go to an alcohol rehabilitation centre. It’s not been a story of success, unfortunately. “In the next few days, she’s going to be fitted with a SCRAM bracelet. It may be in the interest of the criminal courts to order this be observed.  “The bracelet has a sensor that reads alcohol in the sweat and makes a report every  minutes. “It arose from family proceedings of custody of her two children. She has two young sons. “The court will be assisted to see the observations of this bracelet, consulting reports of her psychiatrist and evidence from her sober companion. “She lives at her home, and is with her  hours a day. “If anyone can come back from this, it’s this lady.”  At Langford’s previous hearing at Ealing Magistrates Court on December , her actions were deemed “so serious” that she must be sentenced at a crown court. Recorder Joseph Boothby said: “It seems to me that you have a background and history the court will want to know before I consider the extreme measure of sentencing you to prison.

I’ve taught my ­children so much over the Christmas holidays by thrashing them at Cluedo and Monopoly. But our game of choice is ­Articulate – a describing game against the timer where your team mates have to guess the word. I was worried my eight-year-old daughter would go to piecesthe words were tricky. But I also made it very clear there were going to be no special favours just because of age. I’m highly competitive and clearly take no prisoners. Not even my beloved children. And that’s what they need to see – where you can lose everything on Park Lane to a -year-old man . They get to learn we are living in a world of snakes and ladders and sometimes le is not fair and can be as random as the roll of a dice. Board games also let me see what my kids are made of. Amara was on a mission to beat her older brother Zac. She happily squared up to her dad too. It was -year-old Zac who got frustrated.  He was hard on himself when he could not describe a country in the game. He didn’t like having gaps in his knowledge. And as his mum, nor did I. So what came out of our family fun time was that he wants to learn his world map. I’m happy with that – no way is he going to end up like that Apprentice chap who runs a travel company but couldn’t find Croatia on a globe because he’d only ever used a flat map before! One of my fondest memories is playing draughts with my dad. He was brilliant and taught me how to play. I loved seeingI could even get close to beating him. I rarely did. I never felt anxious but I did feel competitive and wanted to give it my best shot. And he’d always explain where I’d gone wrong. It connected us far more than ­plugging in a PS. Draughts is a game of strategy, thinking ahead, not steaming ahead. It taught me to keep having a go at something I wasn’t good at. And, yes, it also taught me I didn’t like losing.

This meant the mum-of-two was left in hell as she was only able to afford a property in terrible condition. Lauren found a house in the worst state ever but was determined to give it a makeover in time for her and her two sons to enjoy at Christmas.She revealed the incredible transformation in Facebook group DIY on a Budget where members show the fruits of their labour while spending as little cash as possible. Lauren posted in the group: Living in private rented as a single mum Iaposve always used my mum as a guarantor.  aposThis October I was given notice to move out due to landlord selling up just after my mum got made redundant. Unable to rent anywhere  I had to take on the only place I could get through someone I knew that was in the worst state ever barely even habitable with two boys.  Itaposs been hell on earth and real testing times turning this place around quickly to make the nicest home possible for my boys in time for Christmas. Lauren told FEMAIL it said it took around two months to carry out the transformation. She painted the rooms in the propertyaposs bleak and depressing rooms and added new furniture including a table and chest of drawers in the living room. Blued LED lighting was added to the staircase, which had its banisters repainted, and to the bathroom which also had new laminated floors installed. Lauren replaced the dirty carpet in her bedroom with a new grey one and soft furnishing additions such as new cushions, curtains and rugs completed the new look.She said: Thereaposs still a long way to go and far from perfect, but today I am proud of how far I have come on a tight budget. Doing all of the work just myself and my mum.  Finally feeling less depressed and more like this is our home.

And the -year-old chat show queen says she may even be open to a fourth wedding, despite having felt ashamed at her string of failed relationships. But she is keeping her American love’s identity a secret, even though they have been dating for two years. Quirkily, the mum-of-two refers to him only as “hashtag Boo” – but revealed he is the first man to have taken her out for a meal or bought her a ring. Trisha is one of the  celebrities lacing their skates for ITV’s new series of Dancing on Ice, which starts tonight. And although she is the oldest of the group, she insists she will give the youngsters a run for their money. Trisha said: “I might be the oldest in the competition but I’m the fittest, apart from Perri Kiely. “I thought, ‘Oh my god, these kids are so much younger’. But when you’re young you smoke, you drink, you stay up late. It takes a toll.” Diagnosed with breast cancer in , she added: “Physically, I’m very strong. Fitness post-breast cancer got me through. “I know how important it is for my body and mind.” The telly host suffered depression in the s, even attempting to take her own le.  But she says running, weights and resistance bands help to keep the dark thoughts in check. “If I haven’t run for a few days I start feeling like I’m losing control. “Feeling the rain, wind and sun in my face is so special. It got me through my treatment.” And it has made her love her body again – and feel comfortable getting intimate with her new boyfriend. She explained: “I was very wary, having gone through breast cancer, about opening up to someone. I’m not ashamed of my body but you become aware of the changes. “I wear a pressure sleeve – it ain’t the sexiest thing. You go into a new relationship and think, ‘Oh no…’ But #Boo lost his first we from breast cancer.  “Here’s somebody where I don’t even have to finish the sentence. It’s more than the physical, it’s the mental side too. I couldnapost talk with my ex because he was so traumatised by it. “As a woman at the centre of a family you thinkyou appear weak the whole family will fall down. “#Boo completely got it. He makes me feel sexy. If I’m coming down the stairs he tells me how beautul I look. “He buys me gorgeous clothes and can’t wait to see me in them.” Trisha met her beau through a US friend where she now lives, in Connecticut. She said: “#Boo was going through a orce too. We didn’t expect to meet – we were sat at the same table. “We laughed all night, that was two years ago. This is the first time I’ve had a partner that earns more than me, it’s a novelty.  “And I rather like it. He’ll wine and dine me. Can you believe, I had to wait until I was  to be bought a meal  “He bought me a Tfany ring, it’s the first ring a man has ever bought me.” The cancer battle put a huge pressure on her -year marriage to third husband Peter Gianfrancesco, and relationships with daughters Billie Dee, , and Madi, , her children from her second marriage to Mark Grieve. Her first marriage was in  to Australian politician Robert Nestdale, who she later learned was gay. PR manager Billie talked last year about her -year battle with drink and drugs, saying her mum’s absence in her childhood was partly to blame. Trisha admits the family have had their problems, but insists they are as strong as ever after working through it.  She said: “We’re the three musketeers. When one falls, the others help them up. “Last year was a family transition. One of us will go through s**t and will create s**t for the other person.” And she admitted: “I put them through a lot of s**t. We don’t do it to be nasty, we do it because we’re in pain. “Billie was hurt, she was struggling to find a way to deal with it. She’s done an amazing job to come through it. “I’m proud of the young women they’ve grown to be.” Trisha was the first black woman to front a British chat show, rising to fame in  with ITV’s Trisha.  The show switched to Channel  in . She moved to the US when it was axed in . Excited and nervous to be back on prime time UK TV, she admits that what worries her most is remembering the routines – despite the coaching from judges Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean. She said: “I’ve got chemo brain, which really affects my memory, and menopause on top of that. “Skating really helps. I used to get frustrated. “This is really helping as the brain responds to exercise. “If I can remember my whole dance routine you’ll see me get very emotional.  “I can still remember guests from years ago, but short-term memory isn’t great. “I hated the fact I lost my memory, I got angry as it was my living for so long.” She has bonded well with her fellow celebs – but has already developed a reputation for straight-talking backstage. She said: “I like my own space. When they all start talking about how scared they are, I remove myself from the group, get my skipping rope out and skip. “They think I’m mad. If they talk about fear or how much pain they’re in, then I don’t want to hear it. “I didn’t join support groups when I had my cancer treatment. I didn’t want to sit around playing ‘My chemo side effects are worse than yours’. I want to be out in the fresh air, or skipping.”  So what’s next for Trisha after Dancing on Ice  Marriage number four  “I could get married again. A part of me allowed other people to make me feel ashamed about the amount of times I was married.

Iran has pledged to target Americans wherever they are within reach in retaliation for the killing, Tasnim news agency has today quoted a senior Revolutionary Guards commander as saying.General Gholamali Abuhamzeh, the commander of the Guards in the southern province of Kerman, raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the Gulf - also warning Tel Aviv in Israel, is within reach.The threats come amid high tensions worldwide and concentrating in the GUl, with rockets falling near a US Embassy in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad earlier today. At least five people were injured as rockets fell in the Iraqi cityaposs Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions.The incident comes a day after US President Donald Trump ordered the drone execution of Soleimani at Baghdad Airport, sparking fears echoed around social media of the threat of a World War III.Iranaposs countryaposs supreme leader Ali Khamenei stoked global fears of war as he vowed revenge over his generalaposs death, adding: I and the government and the nation of Iran strongly condemn this American crime. Iran reserved the right to take revenge against the US for the death of Soleimani, Mr Abuhamzeh added in comments made late on Friday and reported on by Tasnim today. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital point for the West and a large number of American destroyers and warships cross there ... vital American targets in the region have been identied by Iran since long time ago ... some  US targets in the region as well as Tel Aviv are within our reach, he said.  An expert on the region speculated the targets could include key ally states and assets around the Middle East. Eric Edelman, a former ambassador to Turkey during George W. Bushaposs presidency said Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain are likely targets for Iranaposs wrath. Iran had already attacked the computer networks of oil and gas targets run by Saudi and Qatar interests.Mr Edelman said the plots could also reach far beyond the Gulf region, telling Time today: “They will look for ways to hit us where we don’t expect it,” he says.“But they will be patient. When their nose is bloodied, they tend to take a step back and reassess, before making the next move.”  Another expert, Douglas Silliman, also told the magazineaposs website that American targets and allies in the region faced danger. He said strikes may not necessarily come against American targets, as Iran had a history of targeting Saudi oil facilities and shipping. He warned that people with links to American personnel in the region could also come into Iranaposs crosshairs.

Britain’s most elite forces have been mobilised in the wake of President Trump’s ­ordering the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, . He died in a Reaper drone missile strike near Baghdad airport in ­neighbouring Iraq on Friday. It is understood around  members of the Special Air Service and the Navy’s Special Boat Service along with the Special Forces Support Group will be sent to Iraq to help any possible ­evacuation of Britons in the region. There are at least , military and UK government civilian personnel in Iraq as part of Operation Shader which is the UK mission to help train Iraqi and Kurdish forces defeat Islamic State. Boris Johnson is expected toto London from ­holiday in time for ministerial meetings in No on Monday amid fears of all-out war breaking out in the Gulf.It is understood defence chiefs have ordered British troops in Iraq – numbering around  – to be on high alert following the assassination. Senior commanders are concerned that British nationals could be targeted by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups based inside Iraq. Soleimani was the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force and mastermind of Iran’s Middle East operations. He has been blamed for the deaths and maiming of thousands of British and American troops in operations across the Middle East over decades. One senior UK defence source said: “Soleimani was an enemy combatant in  a war zone who was deploying to oversee and orchestrate Iranian ­operations in a foreign country which would have resulted in the deaths of US soldiers, ­civilians and potentially British personnel as well.  “He knew the risks and took his chances as all troops do and he paid the price.  “Soleimani had been a marked man for quite a while. He had the blood of many British soldiers on his hands. “The attack was all about sending a message to the Iranian leadership and that is that the US can get at you at any time and in any place.” Last night several rockets landed near the US embassy in Baghdad, injuring five people. Three more rockets were reportedly fired at Balad Airbase housing American troops north of Baghdad. In another development Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced British warships would resume ­operations in the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are already in the Gulf and will act as escorts to British tankers to prevent them being seized by Iran’s navy. Mr Wallace said: “The Government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time.” At least  targets in the US and Israel have been identied by Iran for retaliatory strikes after the country’s president vowed to exact revenge for the killing of General Soleimani. Targets include ships in the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and Tel Aviv. The US State Department said: “General Soleimani was actively developing plans to ­attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region.”  Thousands of mourners chanted “Death to America” yesterday as they marched in Soleimani’s funeral procession in Baghdad as US and UK flags were publicly burned. It is feared that all-out war could break out in the regionIran calls on its allies Russia and China to help as tensions rise. The Foreign Office yesterday strengthened its warnings over travel to the Middle East. British nationals were advised not to travel to Iraq or Iran. The Foreign Office warned that anyone in Iraq outside the Kurdistan region should consider leaving by ­commercial means because the ­uncertain security situation could ­deteriorate quickly. Alerts regarding other Middle East nations were also being increased, with warnings that Britons should remain vigilant in Afghanistan, Israel, Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab , who will visit the US next week to meet with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a previously planned visit, said: “The first job of any Government is to keep British people safe.” An American official denied the nation was behind a second air strike on two vehicles north of Baghdad. Iraq’s state TV reported that the attack killed six people in a medical convoy.US president Donald Trump said his order to kill Soleimani was “to stop a war, not to start one”.Back in  Soleimani was involved in backing pro-Iranian militia groups in southern Iraq. These factions targeted British troops with bombs and rockets, killing and maiming a signicant number. In response the SAS set up a special operation to wipe out the Iranian-backed cells. But a mission to kill Soleimani was reportedly blocked by David Miliband, then Foreign Secretary. A British military source said: “The Foreign Secretary said that he wanted to talk to the Iranians, not kill them. “We had Soleimani in our ­crosshairs, but we had to call the operation off because of sensitivities in London about conducting this type of operation.” There has been criticism of the US for not giving advanced notice of the attack to the UK. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the failure to noty was regrettable because allies should ensure there are no surprises in the relationship.Mr Hunt said: “This is a very, very risky situation, and I think the job that we have to do as one of the US’s closest allies is to use our influence.” Friday’s attack also killed four Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards and five of Iraq’s pro-Iran paramilitaries.

Referees need to use it better in England by looking at the monitor more and taking a bit more time to consider the situation and get the right decision.“For major decisions, such as sendings-off and goals, I still think the stats show it works. They get about % of decisions right, which is a lot more than we get now in these situations.”SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell recently commissioned a study into the costs and benefits of bringing the controversial system to the Scottish game.Chairmen of member Scottish clubs will be askedthey will be willing to follow the footsteps of England, where VAR was introduced at the start of the current season.Scotland’s leading referees have reportedly backed the introduction of VAR, which has been used in major tournaments such as the  World Cup and  Women’s World Cup.Maxwell recently said: “In the early part of  we need to be goingand saying, ‘there’s the cost, guys, do you want to do it or not ’”In the aftermath of the recent - win at Celtic, Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson, in a club statement, urged Scottish football chiefs to get on board with VAR to help assist referees with dficult decisions.However, the system has been heavily criticised south of the border for being used wrongly to reverse marginal errors.Five goals in the Premier League were ruled out last weekend for marginal offsides, leading some managers and players to slate VAR.In November Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino was denied a goal against Aston Villa after the VAR team declared a goal-scoring part of his body was offside – in this case his armpit.McInnes still reckons VAR,used correctly, can reduce errors. He said: “VAR minimises the mistakes and frustrations sometimes with decisions.“It is something we should be going all out to get into our game.”It is expected the projected £m annual cost will have to be paid by the clubs.That will likely come from the league distribution prize pot, which is the money left over when all other costs are taken off, or the SFA prize pot distributed to clubs.There is also the possibility the new £m deal with Sky Sports for the Premiership television rights could fund VAR.The Sky Sports deal begins at the start of the - campaign and runs for five years, with the broadcaster screening up to  games per season.A six-year Scottish Cup deal with BBC Scotland and Premier Sports worth £m was also recently confirmed by the SFA.Ultimately whether Scotland will introduce VAR will come down to the finances and whether lower-league clubs will be willing to sacrice some of their income for something only implemented in the top flight.A recent incident where VAR would have been pertinent was the controversial red card shown to Sam Cosgrove in the - defeat to Celtic at Parkhead.Cosgrove was shown a straight red by referee Euan Anderson for a challenge on Kristoffer Ajer.The Aberdeen striker clearly won the ball when running in at speed and footage confirmed that.Aberdeen appealed the dismissal and subsequent two-game ban.However, the appeal was rejected by a fast-track disciplinary  and Cosgrove’s suspension stood for the games against Livingston and Hearts.In the immediate aftermath of the Celtic defeat, McInnes admitted VAR could have helped Cosgrove’s cause.He said: “VAR could have helped out, but you still need the referee to make the right decision.”McInnes is for VAR but it will take the majority of the other  clubs to agree for the controversial system to be introduced."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew.

The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

includes environmentally-damaging glitter as well as grains grown overseas.And at a time of heightened awareness about our planets future, the Royal Highland Education Trust has been enlightening the next generation on producing their own environmentally-friendly reindeer dust.Over the past few weeks officers from the RHET have visited  dferent classes and helped  children produce their own reindeer food.Lesley Mason, RHET Project Coordinator in the Scottish Borders, told us: \"All the ingredients in the food are environmentally friendly and will do no harm to the local wildleSantarsquos

to encourage interest in farming, food production and environmental issues.\"I really hope to be able to offer kits to all nurseries and primary schools in Scottish Borders next year.Sponsorship for the eco-friendly dust workshops came from Hamlyns Oats, Booker Cash  Carry and Tesco, Galashiels.The reindeer dust contains porridge oats, Timothy chaff , popcorn and several other secret ingredients.Lesley added: \"The projectrsquos aim was to teach pupils how farmers grow food for us and other animals, how food grown locally is better for you and the planet and how eating the right food can make you strong and healthy.\"Each pack of food contains three pieces of popcorn, as popcorn is the fuel that makes reindeer fly, although too much and the reindeer might never land

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application. I am disappointed by the decision but it went through the democratic process."},{"url":null,"title":"mekala-osbornes-family-put-christmas-hold-recovers","story":"The -year-old, from Wallyford, a former Preston Lodge High School pupil, fell ill while travelling through Vietnam with what was originally diagnosed as bronchial pneumonia.After being put into an induced coma in a critical condition, Mekala was moved to a hospital in Singapore before she eventually travelled to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.Mekalarsquos mum Yvonne Bonnar McAulay said Mekala was now able to sit up in a chair for several hours a day and was being weaned off a ventilator however she said it feels like a bit of a ldquostandstill time in her recovery.She told the Courier: ldquoDue to everything thatrsquos happened, we feel itrsquos appropriate to put Christmas on hold.ldquoWe will have a wee breakfast for [her brother] Danny: he doesnrsquot understand Christmas so itrsquos pretty much another day for him, but we are doing our best to give Danny his own wee special Christmas Day.ldquoGranny is helping out so I can spend the afternoon and some of the night with Mekala.ldquoIt is a long road ahead as she needs to get her lungs working properly and then concentrate on gaining her muscle back throughout her body, then physio will start.ldquoShe will be in isolation until after the year.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

This is the first step towards bringing agricultural beasts back and using them to improve the conditions of the productive land on the island.As well as paving the way towards the reintroduction of farming activities, the cows presence is hoped to help boost bioersity and help support corncrakes and rare species such as the Slender Scotch Burnett Moth.Subtle signs of activity on Ulva come  months after the island celebrated a controversial pound. million community ownership deal largely funded by public money.Some argued it was a harsh day for the islandrsquos owner, Jamie Howard. Recently widowed and whose family had owned Ulva for three generations, his hope to sell to his preferred bidder was removed from his hands by Scottish Government community land reform rules.Others, however, embraced the move as a new dawn for an island which had suffered at the hands of th and th-century owners.In , the population of Ulva and neighbouring Gometra ndash attached by a narrow bridge ndash stood at . Within seven years it would slump to a mere  and by the s, Ulva, a favourite spot for Beatrix Potter, Sir Walter Scott and visited by James Boswell and Dr. Samuel Johnson, would have just seven families left, with crofts abandoned and properties in ruins.Since the change of ownership, however, interest has soared among people keen to visit and, perhaps surprisingly for a remote spot with no car ferry, school, shop or roads, to set up home.Recently a survey by the North West Mull Community Woodland Company Ltd, which as a result of last yearrsquos community buyout owns Ulva, revealed its population could balloon by , per centall applications to become its newest residents were accepted.More than  people have lodged their interest in living on the island: a challenge, given there are currently just a handful of residential properties and no infrastructure other than a single restaurant ndash The Boathouse ndash to support them.There are, however, big plans. And the arrival of the Highland cattle, says Ms Reid, are just the start.By next summer, the six residential properties are expected to have been fully refurbished. The plan includes the restoration of a Thomas Telford-designed manse, built in the s and long abandoned, and there have been hints that its neighbouring church could one day become a music venue.Further ahead, there has been talk of a proper campsite, mini-hotel and hostel for tourists who want to extend their visit, an oyster farm and shops. Itrsquos been suggested that within a decade, Ulva could be home to at least  people, rising to  by .Certainly, there is a major rise in interest: visitor numbers have boomed from around , a year to over , over the course of the past year, raising questions over the tiny islandrsquos ability to cope with the additional footfall.ldquoThere has been a signicant increase in the numbers of people coming across to visit, says Ms Reid. ldquoIt will lead to pressure on infrastructure on the island, but we are working on a number of things to manage it and to give visitors a more erse experienceldquoWe are very aware of the impact of more visitors and we dont want the island to be overwhelmed.Those who made the short journey from Mull during recent weeks may have noticed subtle changes. For a start, volunteers have tackled the overgrown walled garden at Ulva House which, until the buyout, was the fine B-listed mansion home to the Howard family.Plans for the house are said to include refurbishing half to become a high-quality self-catering property which would fund the running of an interpretation and educational centre in the other half.Further plans are understood to focus on the development of infrastructure to support house plots for sale and self-build and for the construction of rented accommodation.If the cattlersquos recent arrival signies a giant leap towards theof an agricultural sector on the island, there is another sign of a new era.Sheila MacFadyen was a dairy maid for the Clark family, Ulvarsquos owners until the mid-th century. The last resident of a row of humble cottages, she left for Mull in the s.She died in , but her blackhouse remained to become a crucial part of island heritage and destination for visitors curious to discover more of the islandersrsquo basic way of le.Work on its restoration is now complete. Even \"Sheila\" ndash a mannequin which has sat huddled in a corner of the tiny home ndash has had a revamp, and become another highly visible sign of change on Ulva.ldquoThe mannequin had become quite spooky, she was looking tired and ragged, explains Ms Reid.ldquoWe have had a donation of Harris Tweed for a new skirt, and volunteers in Mull are giving her a bit of a new look. Once shersquos had her makeover, shersquoll sit at a spinning wheel that has been done up along with information boards and maps.Sheilarsquos Cottage, she adds, will remain at the heart of island le ndash a vital link with times gone by and a bright new future.ldquoThere has been a huge amount of effort behind the scenes, processes and paperwork and consultations that people canrsquot see.ldquoThe re-thatching of Sheilarsquos Cottage and the arrival of the Highland cows is very symbolic people can see things happening.ldquoWe are planning to announce a number of major plans in the new year.ldquoWe are on the cusp of a new start."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-next-time-anyone-asks-sideways-tilt-head-answer---managing-decline","story":"Wersquod all have to take a turn as Pat ie patroller driven around the city until the early hours, calling in at police stations and hospital portersrsquo cubby holes wearily askinganything were happening.There the gruesome, the tragic and sometimes the surreally comic, tales of the city at night were held up as pickings for early hours copy to be inserted into the latest issue.The guys had to be careful, though, when introducing themselves to the punters as the much-beloved Pat Roller, after one became a night incident himself when floored by a drunk who said: lsquoNah, yoursquore no.

They clearly didnrsquot think Jeremy Corbyn believed in Britain or had the nationrsquos best interests at heart.Now, one of Mr Corbynrsquos disciples, Rebecca Long-Bailey, has recognised this. In her leadership pitch in theshe has called for Labour to adopt ldquoprogressive patriotism to bring the country together. She is suggesting that Labourrsquos electoral problem was not just opposition to Brexit but its ambivalence regarding the nation.Ms Long-Bailey doesnrsquot see why patriotism should be the property of the right. We should celebrate ldquoLancashire mill workers who supported Abraham Lincolnrsquos anti-slavery blockade of cotton from the American South. But even this tentative and politically-correct version of patriotism proved too much for s of Labour purity on Twitter. She was taken to task for spreading ldquoloathsome nonsense...Tory Lite...dog whistle nationalism. ldquoProgressive patriotism is an oxymoron, said one critic, ldquolike humane fascism. For many supporters of Jeremy Corbyn love of country is irremediably toxic.During the long Brexit culture war, this attitude finally alienated Labourrsquos older, socially conservative voters in the Midlands and North of England. The question is whether Labour has the will or the capacity to win them back. It would have to go a lot further than history lessons about anti-slavery.Can you imagine Momentum activists saying how much they love Britain and its history  Can you hear David Lammy say that, actually, Britain is not a racist country  Mr Corbyn saying that the British Empire wasnrsquot all bad Imagine Ms Long-Bailey saying that our armed forces are the best of British. Or that most men are kind and loving fathers and not part of an oppressive patriarchy. Twitter would go into meltdownLabour started talking about controlling immigration.I just canrsquot see Labour becoming patriotic in a way northern English voters would recognise. Stormzy would be furious.would say it had gone populist, fascist, even.But the inconvenient truth is that many voters just seem hard-wired to regard their community and their country with pride. It is a lot to do with accentuating the positive. The relentless miserablism of the Left leaves people with nothing to feel good about. Itrsquos like watching a permanent Ken Loach film.Scottish nationalists used to make the same mistake of revelling in miserablism. They banged on about how Scotland was impoverished and demeaned by England and how theyrsquod stolen our oil. Then in the noughties it discovered positive nationalism and started talking up Scotland as a progressive country that could be a model for the world. Inclusive, democratic, equalitarian.It worked. The SNPrsquos electoral dominance today is directly related to its celebration of Scotland. The  referendum campaign, with its Yestivals and Saltires, was all about feeling good about being Scottish.Could Labour learn from this  Or has Labour sold its soul to a version of liberal identity politics which loathes the very idea of nations  Labour intellectuals like Emily Thornberry laugh at flag-waving English patriots. Labour academics regard Britain as a neocolonial power, with blood on its hands, oppressing people abroad and racist at home.This is why this General Election could be terminal for Labour. Unlike in Scotland, the English Left seems incapable of finding any positive dimension to nationalism. Britishness is seen as inherently right wing and racist ndash even though Britain gave the world parliamentary democracy, abolished the slave trade and led the defeat of fascism.The Tory PM is dismantling the overtly racist, imperial nationalism of Churchill and Thatcher, in favour of the self-mocking, popular nationalism of the  Olympic Opening Ceremony. Danny Boylersquos pageant of English identity was of course authorised by Mr Johnson as London Mayor. It featured NHS nurses, Chartists and icons of popular culture. Thatrsquos the kind of One Nation Conservatism that Boris Johnson is grasping for, and is temperamentally capable of delivering.It is about reflecting the nation in a favourable light, but it is also a way of doing politics. The Prime Minister is successful because he is relentlessly positive. He makes people feel good about themselves. Labourrsquos characterisation of him as a hard-bitten racist demagogue doesnrsquot ring true. Mr Johnson is actually more in the hail-fellow-well-met mould of one Alex Salmond, who made the SNP what it is today.Mr Salmond too was a gted populist leader, a romantic nationalist who loved Scottish history and understood the importance of supporting the Scottish regiments, even the Queen. The media regarded him with suspicion, but many Scottish voters loved him. He wedded nationalism to social democratic themes of inclusion and equality. In his  Hugo Young lecture on progressive nationalism he hailed left-wing policies, like tuition fees, as the ldquosocial wage.Unlike Mr Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon does not like nationalism, and is quite obviously embarrassed by it. Shersquos even said she would like to remove the word ldquonational from the party name. Butshe did she would risk throwing the cultural baby out with the liberal bathwater. The SNP was an early the beneficiary of the wave of populist nationalism that has now swept England.SNP intellectuals loathe the idea that Scottish nationalism might have anything in common with Brexit and English nationalism. But the similarities are too obvious to ignore. They were both populist rebellions against globalisation and neoliberalism by people who love their country and seek sanctuary within it.How these two nationalisms, Scottish and English, learn to coexist ndash or donrsquot ndash will decide the future of the United Kingdom.

Usually, each side plays two games over the weekendoften against the same team resulting in signicant travel, not only for the players but the fans that opt to follow them.The Glasgow Clan fans, known as the Purple Army, have attracted much attention in recent years due to their loyal fanbase and large travelling numbers. Their supporters made headlines across the world last year after showing solidarity with LGBT people with a message that ice hockey is a sport that welcomes everyone. Their lsquoHockey is For Everyonersquo display at the National Playoffs in Nottingham attracted global attention and received much praise from media and fans across the world.:First-time fan writes about experience of hockey at Glasgow ClanWhile ice hockey may not be the biggest sport in the UK, it does have a passionate and loyal fanbase, and certainly, the Glasgow Clan are no dferent. Their Official Supporters Clubattracts hundreds of members each season who pride themselves on their ability to follow their club wherever they go. And it was this dedication and reputation that led to me arriving just before  am outside of Braehead to embark on an away day with the Purple Army.The round trip to Belfast would see these fans onthe road for around  hours, and I sought to find out what motivates Clan fans to spend hours travelling to watch their side play ice hockey and why such a niche sport has picked up such a loyal fanbase.I arrived for the bus departing Braehead with films downloaded on my phone and comforts that would let me pass the journey sprawled out across the bus, however, I was astounded to find three coaches awaiting over  members of the Clan fanbase who had opted to travel. It immediately became clear why the OSC was the envy of many teams in the league and why such a model was being looked at by other clubs. I soon found myself in the awkward position of having to ask an OSC organiser what bus I was on, having initially assumed there would only be one.En route to #Belfast with the @ClanOSC for a fan piece for @heraldscotland  @Glasgow_Times.

However, I was also surprised to see head coach Zach Fitzgerald and the Clan players descend from their coach and sit next to the fans. All were more than happy to talk and mix with supporters. I couldnrsquot help but wonderthis was part of the appeal of following the Clan, with the players and supporters having such a transparent and civil relationship. Having recently attended the Scotland v Russia match, I couldnrsquot imagine a situation that would allow me to take the same coach as Andy Robertson to Hampden, yet here, I sat inches from the heroes of the Purple Army asit was just a normal morning.Certainly, it was this family-friendly appeal that hooked so many fans into travelling when I got chatting to members of the OSC. Eddie Squires, , said that the ldquofamily atmosphere and supporting his local team was one of the main draws for his love of hockey.

Both were ing to Belfast having spent the last four days in Scotland and following the arrival of  people in Clan shirts, had asked the trio about their side. This sparked a conversation about hockey with Sean and Mike committing to come to the game in Belfast. Sean, originally from Wisconsin said that the passion from the fans was instantly obvious and that the supporters had been open in welcoming them along as soon as they told of their interest in hockey. He said: ldquoEveryone we talk to with the Clan, theyrsquore passionate.

But no, not according to the right wing press or the left wing ultras who are piling in behind it. They cannot forgive Sir Keir for having the temerity to earn more than the national living wage selflessly saving people in far-off places from being executed on the basis of shaky evidence seems to be beside the point as far as they are concerned. Using his prodigious talents, not to make squillions in the City as so many Tory MPs routinely do, but to try and make the justice system fairer ndash that counts for little.

How very dare he.He is now front-runner to win the Labour leadership election according to a poll this week, but the savage campaign to discredit him has begun even before hersquos formally declared as a candidate: expect to hear a whole lot more about the ldquomillionaire metropolitan lawyer, as his detractors have branded him. Even his pro-Remain stance seems to offend his opponents less than this.The danger now is that this plays into a Stalinist tendency on the Labour left to demonise anyone who isnrsquot deemed working class enough.Itrsquos absurd to campaign for better opportunities for working-class people only to shoot down anyone who makes the best of those opportunities, including public servants. Itrsquos also an odd form of logic to argue that former Labour voters who merrily backed the millionaire journalist Boris Johnson might be put off by the less well-off human rights lawyer Sir Keir Starmer.But there is also huge electoral danger in seeking narrowly to represent one narrowly defined social class, when the importance of class identity has been diminishing.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard is one Corbyn acolyte who likes to throw the ldquoc word about. Here he is in June : ldquoWe need to stop iding people on the basis of nationality and start uniting people on the basis of class to bring about real change. Really  Both are isive, making people who donrsquot subscribe to those forms of identity feel unwanted. But thatrsquos not the only problem: itrsquos also patronising to tell people which party they should vote for on the basis of their perceived class.In Scotland, Labourrsquos historic decline in the early st century can partly be blamed on taking working class voters for granted and treating them asthey had a tribal duty to vote Labour. Those voters disagreed and the SNP benefited from their disaffection.Britainrsquos class system is sadly alive and kicking, but it is in flux, and not just because the mines are deserted and the factories have fallen silent. Itrsquos because demographics have changed due to a ersying economy and progressive educational policies. People whose parents fitted the traditional definition of working class are now more likely to see themselves as being middle class.Being ldquoworking class is also harder to define than it once was. The ABCversus the CDEclassication system is decades old and based on rigid definitions of occupation. It takes little account of the gig economy, in-work poverty and graduate debt, things that unite the interests of iniduals across old traditional class lines.But perhaps, above all, things have changed because there are many other forms of identity that are even more important to people than their class background. Identity is now much more likely to be values-based.National identity matters, but social media has created new groups of like-minded people on everything from climate campaigning to sexual identity which have little to do with their geographical community or social class. Age is now more of a predictor of voting intention than occupation or income so is the yawning liberal conservative ide.Britain is a heinously unequal society and desperately needs a party that represents the interests of the have-nots over the elite, but the answer is not a Corbynite Labour Party that thinks nothing has changed in  years. Surely Labourrsquos crushing election defeat proves that.After Tony Blairrsquos landslide in , the Conservatives went through three leaders in quick succession ndash William Hague, Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard ndash each moving the party further to the right. It took eight years for the penny to drop that the party must try and appeal to middle-ground votersit was to regain power.There is a clear and present danger of Labour making the same mistake, by tacking left and adopting a new leader in the image of the old one and consigning the party to years in opposition.Sir Keir is not the messiah but characterising him ashe were a virtue-signalling champagne socialist, is a gross injustice. A man of substance and conviction with real-world achievements to prove it, he would certainly be a heavyweight opponent to our flighty self-serving Prime Minister.His  per cent showing in the poll of Labour members, compared to  for Mr Corbynrsquos anointed favourite Rebecca Long-Bailey, speaks volumes about the frustration of Labour members with the leadershiprsquos failed form of class politics.There is a long way to go with this contest and it is taking place before the causes of Labourrsquos failure on December  have been fully understood.

Compromise to create a larger good.It will be uncomfortable. Creature comforts and conveniences will have to be sacriced cars, plastics, and on. But the compromise is vital.So too is to try, where possible, to stop looking at issues as binary.A hugely problematic and frustrating element of public discourse that has developed is the habit of seeing people as for us or against us. This is common in the Scottish independence debate ndash you are pro-independence or you hate Scotland.In the trans debate too, you are pro-self ID, the new legislation proposed that will allow trans people to more easily and painlessly gain a Gender Recognition Certicate, or you hate trans people.The notion of existence has become a common theme too. Itrsquos not unusual to see, mid-debate, someone claim that the other party would prefer them not to exist.

It needs a compelling offer on the constitutional question, without which it will struggle to get the public to respond to the many positive policies it advocates and constitutional rather than class politics will continue to dominate.Although Ms Sturgeon has called for Indyref in , there appears little prospect of Boris Johnson giving Holyrood the power for it.The SNP MP Kenny MacAskill this week admitted the chance of Indyref in  was probably ldquonil and that was ldquono bad thing, given the SNP had yet to fix problems in its losing independence prospectus of .Mr Smithrsquos call for the Scottish Labour party and trade unions to back Indyref follows two Labour MSPs, Monica Lennon and Neil Findlay, agreeing with Ms Sturgeon that the Scottish people should decide its timing, not Westminster.Also writing in the new Scottish Left Review, Mr Findlay said: ldquoWe cannot deny the people of Scotland a second referendum where the majority is calling for it.

The Government would later pay out more than pound, towards Mr Salmondrsquos legal costs.It got worse for Ms Sturgeon when the opposition whipped up a Holyrood committee to examine where it all went wrong, and why she unaccountably kept in touch with him during the probe.The other parties made little secret of their desire to string the process out to the  Holyrood election to keepMs Sturgeon on the back foot.But then Mr Salmond ed to court in very dferent circumstances.On January , he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court and was charged with  offences, including attempted rape and sexual assault. He strenuously denied any wrongdoing.The Holyrood inquiry was put on ice.Also in January, it emerged two patients had died at the pound million Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings.The QEUH would stay in the headlines for the rest of the year, a gathering cloud over Scotlandrsquos largest health board and a scandal that still has a long way to run.The annual SNP-Green Budget pact saw Holyrood dip a toe into one of its taboo powers ndash the ability to invent taxes.A tourist tax and a workplace parking tax were the result. The latter saw the other parties, especially the Tories, rev themselves into a frenzy. The din over a pound a week parking bay levy was all out of proportion to its impact.Far more signicant, yet less noisily received, was the failure of SNP ministers to deliver the devolved welfare system they had demanded for years.In February, they admitted they had not fully assumed responsibility until , more than three years late.Critics said it made of mockery of the partyrsquos previous promise to deliver independence in a fleeting  months.In April, Ms Sturgeon lobbed some red meat to SNP members on the eve of the partyrsquos conference by announcing a generic Referendums Bill, the vehicle for a second independence referendumWestminster granted the missing power, and for an Irish-style Citizens Assembly to chew Scotlandrsquos long-term problem.But it wasnrsquot enough to head off the grassroots revolt that would dominate the gathering.As the SNP leadership tried to push the partyrsquos Growth Commission through conference, activists and past and present MPs resisted Andrew Wilsonrsquos hairshirt economic blueprint for independence, with currency the focus.In a rare defeat, Ms Sturgeonrsquos plan to cling on to the pound indefinitely was replaced by the membershiprsquos demand for a new Scottish currency ldquoas soon as practicable after a Yes vote.The Unionist parties hoped it would clamp the wheels of the SNP bandwagon.But, not for the last time in , they were sorely mistaken.In May, the SNP triumphed in the European elections on a strident anti-Brexit .The party improved from two of Scotlandrsquos six MEPs to three, with the LibDems, Tories and Brexit party getting one each. Despite being in its th year of government, the SNP managed to lt its share of the vote by . per cent to .%.Even more stunning was the collapse in Scottish Labourrsquos vote. Doubly handicapped by Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard, the party lost almost two-thirds of its vote and both its MEPs to trail in fth on .%. The result screamed out for an end to Labourrsquos Brexit havering and its weak leadership, but it didnrsquot happen.The only resignation was by Labour MSP Neil Findlay, who had been in charge of the Scottish campaign, who left the partyrsquos front bench and said he wouldnrsquot stand for re-election in , citing ldquoendless internal battles.Ms Sturgeon used the aftermath of the election to announce, on a visit to Dublin, that she wanted to hold Indyref in the second half of .Logistically, the date made no sense. There would not be enough time to translate a Yes vote into independence before the  election came along.But politically, by putting a date out there, the First Minister teed up the fight she knows will fuel the  campaign.The election also led to a change in leadership for the Tories ndash two, in fact.The day after the EU vote, which she had assured the nation would never take place as the UK would be out on March , Theresa May finally croaked her resignation statement in Downing Street.Unable to get Brexit done, her fractious party had done her in instead.Her departure triggered a fateful contest to find a new Tory leader.Boris Johnsonrsquos win was never in doubt.In July, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman cancelled the opening of the new poundm Sick Childrenrsquos Hospital in Edinburgh at five daysrsquo notice after tests found inadequate ventilation systems had been installed. There were now hospital scandals at both ends of the M.In August, politicians seemed to take over the Edinburgh Fringe, with Ms Sturgeon, Ruth Davidson and John McDonnell all popping up, the latter to announce Labour would not stand in the way of Indyrefit won power.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard, who had vowed to resist Indyref, was humiliated, then rapidly toed the shadow chancellorrsquos line.It was a necessary calculation by UK Labour ndash it knew it wouldnrsquot be ing many Scottish MPs and needed SNP votes to govern as a minority ndash but it proved an early gt for PM Johnson.Ms Davidson saved her grand finale for the week the festival left town.Resigning after eight years as the Scottish Toriesrsquo most successful leader, she cited the demands of a young family, but also her ldquoconflict over Brexit.As she had backed three dferent candidates against him to be leader, that was code for Mr Johnson.She used her new-found freedom to become mired in a self-inflicted row over a pound,-a-day job at a London public relations firm, leaving many to wonder how she had acquired her reputation as a ldquodferent kind of Tory in the first place.August also saw Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow go into administration after a long dispute between the yard owners and the state firm behind CalMac over a poundm order for two ferries that doubled in cost and timescale.A childrenrsquos ward at QEUH was closed to new admissions after three young patients contracted infections. The next month, Ms Freeman announced a public inquiry into the extent of building problems at the hospital and Edinburghrsquos Sick Kids.Health was now the running disgrace of the autumn. Although almost all the problems began before her time as Health Secretary, Ms Freeman faced repeated calls to resign.In November, the mother of Milly Main, who died at the Glasgow childrenrsquos hospital in September  aged , said she was % certain contaminated water was to blame.The Crown Office confirmed it was investigating the death of a three-year-old boy from around the same time. Ms Freeman put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into ldquospecial measures.A whistleblower revealed the board was warned of infection risks across the QEUH site before it opened in .In November, Mr Salmond appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh, where the full details of the charges against him, now slightly revised, were made public.Speaking outside, he said he would be pleading not guilty to all of them.In December, the Scottish Government faced more bad news on education, as Scotland slipped to its worst ever place in the international rankings for science and maths, though reading improved.In the dying days of the parliamentary year, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay admitted it would cost poundm more to finish the two ferries rusting at the now nationalised Ferguson Marine yard.The Government also announced it was ending the Abellio ScotRail franchise three years early because of concerns over value for money for a service that exasperated passengers.There were more delays to a poundm plan for superfast broadband. NHS waiting times for AE hit record lows. Economic growth was near stagnant.Yet Ms Sturgeon was still able to end the year on a bang thanks to the General Election. She put Indyref centre stage ndash at least at first ndash then switched to ousting Boris Johnson and stopping Brexit.She achieved neither. But the SNP harvested Labour votes and gained  seats plus a th won by an independent who will surelyto the party fold.The Scottish Tories, meanwhile, went backwards after saying the Union was on the ballot paper and urging people to use their vote to reject Indyref.But people saw through the distraction ndash a cross for the Tories meant more Boris and more Brexit, neither of which have endeared themselves to Scotland.That was their immediate concernndash Indyref will be for a later date.The most dramatic event ndash and Pyrrhic victory ndash of election night was the SNP ousting LibDemsrsquo leader Jo Swinson in East Dunbartonshire. The sight of one Remain party decapitating another must have gladdened Tory hearts no end.As in Mayrsquos European election, Scottish Labourrsquos collapse was profound.The party that won  million votes in the election of  under Gordon Brown and Iain Gray managed just half that under Mr Corbyn and Mr Leonard.Its share of the vote fell in every seat in Scotland, and it ended with .%, compared to .% in England.It is asScottish Labour supporters no longer sustain one party but have become a loose communal resource, an unlocked bank other parties can ransack for votes.Ms Sturgeon quickly used her gains to demand endless referendum powers for Holyrood.

Its interiors were redesigned by Chanel in the s when she was in a relationship with Hugh \"Bendor\" Grosvenor, the second Duke of Westminster.Despite her leaving the home more than  years ago, a number of the rooms still bear her work, including fragments of wallpaper she designed.Chanel had hand-blocked wallpaper shipped in from France, and oversaw local workmen as they put together simple fireplaces.A team of specialists who act on behalf of the Chanel Archive previously viewed the property and offered their support in giving access to all their records.A planning permission renewal application - for a hotel and five new-built guest lodges in the grounds - was lodged in  on behalf of Ghulum Choudry of the Rosehall Estate.Now, after four years on the open market, an undisclosed offer made by a family from abroad has been accepted, Malik Afsar of Remax Central estate agents said.The purchaser bought Rosehall because of planning permission that will allow it to be converted into a hotel, he added.Built in  after a fire gutted the original building, Rosehall was owned by the duke, one of the worlds richest men, during the s.

He wrote: \"Coco is here in place of Violet [Nelson, the dukes second we]. She fishes from morn till night, and in two months has killed  salmon. She is very agreeable - really a great and strong being fit to rule a man or an Empire.\"Rosehall comes with five separate buildings and is the only home outside of Switzerland and France with interiors by Chanel.

Politicians were treated with respect and the use of swear words was to risk being regarded as a sociopath. No matter what issues ided us what chasms of culture, class and wealth lay between us they were all forgotten when we solemnly watched the Queen on Christmas Day. These arrangements had been carefully cultivated over decades to ensure that scant opportunity was permitted for meaningful dialogue between ordinary people and those whom they touchingly believed represented their interests at Parliament.At least you knew back then that there would be an opportunity to change the Government every five years or so. This was on a strictly need-to-know basis and was controlled by the old Etonians and Oxbridge cult who ran the BBC and owned our biggest newspapers.The journalists and editors who operated the print and broadcast media on the other hand were untouchable and never held to account. What passed for scrutiny of their stories and agendasconsisted of a letters page edited by elderly and scholarly chaps nearing retirement. Thus there was room for seven or eight epistolary interventions by the dear readers, usually by those who could express themselves in the manner of a university lecturer and who could pepper their prose with droll classicisms. The people who shaped the political and cultural agenda of the UK media landscape could distort perceptions, wreck lives and destroy careers safe in the knowledge that theyrsquod never be challenged.Occasionally, a political scandal would break beyond the confines of the political and media establishment. For a while, we would all be permitted to catch a glimpse of rich and famous people behaving in the same way as the rest of us. The wonder of these came in discovering that the stratagems of the ruling elites could be blown off course by sex, drink and lies too. All too soon the show was over and an official report would soon exonerate those with the best connections and a scapegoat was offered for public excoriation.The Profumo Affair, currently being re-imagined by the BBC was one of these. The imbroglio had started three years earlier with a brief affair between John Profumo, the Defence Secretary and Christine Keeler, a struggling -year-old model. The episode was one of those which offered us an all-too-rare glimpse of power at the top of British society. While the rest of us were being told to hate the Russians and exercise restraint in our personal lives there was the government and the aristocracy cavorting with the enemy and compromising the virtue of working-class girls in the private swimming pool of the House of Astor.Once calm had been restored and the bed-sheets turned down a compliant judge was found and a whitewash report hastily constructed. The millionaire Sir John Profumo resigned and dedicated himself to charitable work before being redeemed by Margaret Thatcher two decades later. Stephen Ward, the society osteopath discovered that, without aristocratic blood, his connections amounted to little. He killed himself after being trussed up and fed to the country. Christine Keeler, a beautul woman of high intelligence and common birth struggled for the rest of her le.If the scandal had occurred in the age of social media I suspect the losers might have become winners. Ms Keelerrsquos legal fees would have been crowd-funded and Mr Ward would have found widespread sympathy. The independence of the judiciary would have been exposed as a sham and, not for the first time, intimate connections between the British elite and the nationrsquos enemies would have been revealed.As this new decade dawns messages of hope have been laced with appeals for kindness on social media. In particular, an article by the Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser has engendered debate. He has been joined by assorted political pundits who purport to desire a sense of decency in the way we engage with each other on social media. Itrsquos dficult to argue with some of this when you observe politicians being terrorised by psychopathic mobs, often within their own parties, who seek to destroy them for holding reasonable views they canrsquot stand.I also become queasy when fake academic faculties which exist to make failed politicians feel good about themselves urge us all to gentry the political environment. In the UK and across the world a war of ideas is being fought which will affect our lives profoundly. Britain is in the hands of a feckless and self-serving fop backed by a party thatrsquos been taken over by an extremist, right-wing sect. To make his hard Brexit fly he must approach the White Housersquos resident sociopath like a supplicant.A tonne of leverage will be required to sell the outcome but when you control % of the mainstream media and can rely on a BBC still dominated by Eton and Oxford to look the other way you are already halfway there. In the absence of a ing Labour Party social media provides the main source of opposition. This is no time to be worrying too much about it harbouring bad language and anger."},{"url":null,"title":"cate-devine-adult-diners-acting-like-spoilt-children","story":"Recently Irsquove been intrigued to read online comments from Scottish chefs and restaurateurs expressing their frustration at trying to satisfy the increasingly dficult demands of diners. Some of these demands stem from genuine dietary intolerances and allergies, but many appear to be based on nothing more than maddening game-playing.The chef-patron of a Michelin-starred restaurant posted that he spends more time writing menus for dietary requirementsthan for what he called ldquoreal menus. ldquoIntolerances, etc., today include: dairy, shellfish, gluten, vegetarianplus no caviar, lamb, beef, game, processed sugar, orange, grapefruit, squid, melon, cucumber, offal, egg or nuts, he wrote, adding that ldquoitrsquos always interesting to see someone non-dairy end their meal with a latte, because theyrsquove lsquoavoided dairy for most of the dayrsquo.Another post highlighted the frustration of unreasonable demands ndash and ensuing complaints. ldquoDidnrsquot get a window table . Donrsquot have Harveyrsquos Bristol cream, donrsquot do chips or omelette. Wonderthey do Tripadvisor.But intrigue has morphed into deep unease as ldquofaux intolerances and allergies have started to invade and discombobulate the eating-out scene. I was quite heartened when an Edinburgh restaurateur stepped forward to sum up the situation from her industryrsquos point of view: ldquoA lsquoveganrsquo not keen on pasta or gazpacho will have calamari, butternut risotto and chocolate cregraveme brulee. A customer who is allergic to pork products, citrus fruits, unpasteurised dairy, raw rare seafood and meat, lentils and pulses, wants calamari, venison and tarte Tatin. She added: ldquoThis is why every restaurateur in the land is on Valium or has become an alcoholic by December . They [diners] should just write their own menu. She suggested that restaurants should start demanding doctorsrsquo letters to prove that an allergy was real, and cited a prominent chef describing the situation as critical: the ldquofaux dietaries were killing the catering industry and were its biggest challenge.The online response was predictably robust ndash to the extent that she actually left Twitter for a bit to recover from the vitriol, which included being fat-shamed and accused of being in denial about being unhealthy herself. But one comment in particular caught my attention: ldquoSuppliers of anything need to adapt to what people want, not vice versa.And therersquos the rub. Itrsquos all very well to claim this, but the problem is that chefsno longer have any idea of what diners actually want from one minute to the next ndash and neither, it seems, do diners themselves. Coeliac disease and lactose intolerance, say, create real and genuine need for chefs to adapt their menus ndash and is the reason menus prominently display the letters V, GF, and so on. And I know of at least one top seafood chef who happily expanded his menu to welcome vegans, and many other chefs who have re-thought their entire menus to make them plant-heavy and meat-light for the same reason. They tell me they applaud the opportunity to be more creative with new and exciting dishes that can be safely consumed by as many customers as possible. Obviously this makes commercial as well as ideological sense.But recent evidence suggests that demands have gone beyond that to the extent that chefs are now expected to dance to the tune of spur-of-the-moment whims of diners on the night ndash without warning, and thus robbed of the chance to plan and source dishes in advance.Are people out to have a laugh at restaurantsrsquo expense just to big up the number of clicks on their online s  If so, itrsquos a deeply irresponsible practice that puts hard-won culinary reputations, careers and entire businesses at serious risk. Not to mention making a mockery of those with genuine dietary conditions. No wonder some within the industry are fighting back by outing the culprits online. This too is a risky game that restaurants would not willingly choose to play unless compelled to do so, and I applaud them for having the courage to do it.To dismiss the culprits as ldquofussy eaters is to excuse appalling behaviour. Equally, it would be too easy to conclude that such bad manners are down to ignorance of what running a restaurant entails, and that this ignorance has enabled a shocking lack of respect for the industry ndash despite the best efforts of MasterChef and other such television programmes to educate and inform. I also suspect that encouraging these people to do some research by reading a restaurantrsquos menu before booking a table would be futile.I fear that whatrsquos happening here is a deliberate disruption of the status quo. Dissing those we should most admire, just because we can, is not a good look for a nation whose culinary reputation is increasingly celebrated across the globe. Yet a wedge is being driven between the mutual sense of respect that used to be part of the collective restaurant experience by the rude arrival of an army of self-righteous iniduals whose sense of entitlement apparently knows no bounds.I can only hope that matching faux intolerances with real intolerance will put the disruptersrsquo gas at a peep ndash and keep restaurants in business for the rest of us to enjoy."},{"url":null,"title":"tribunal-rules-ethical-veganism-philosophical-belief","story":"Jordi Casamitjana said he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports after raising concerns that its pension fund was being invested into companies involved in animal testing.He claims he was unfairly disciplined for making this disclosure and that the decision to dismiss him was because of his philosophical belief in ethical veganism.: From veganism to Scottish independence - its time for radical actsAt the tribunal in Norwich on Friday, judge Robin Postle gave a short summary judgment, ruling that ethical veganism satisfies the tests required for it to be a philosophical belief and is therefore protected under the Equality Act .He also ruled that Mr Casamitjana, , who lives in London, adheres to the belief of ethical veganism.For a belief to be protected under the Act, it must meet a series of tests including being worthy of respect in a democratic society, not being incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with fundamental rights of others.The ruling means that ethical vegans are entitled to protection from discrimination.Dietary vegans and ethical vegans both eat a plant-based diet, but ethical vegans also try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation including not wearing clothing made of wool or leather and not using products tested on animals.In his ruling, Judge Postle said ethical veganism was ldquoimportant and ldquoworthy of respect in a democratic society.:Veganism is touted as a solution to climate change, but is a plant based diet really the answer He said: ldquoI am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief.Speaking after the ruling, Mr Casamitjana said: ldquoI am extremely happy.

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"discover the beauty of africa in belfast","story":"HOW Do I Pronounce Your Name  That’s a common question. No worries. I can’t even think of how I’ll start pronouncing your very dficult Irish first name. Foreigners will take time to digest the following Gaelic names: Caoimhe, Oisín, Siobhán, Niamh and a host of others. There is a historical context to this and this could just be the colonial remnants that were left in Africa as official languages! But that’s not an excuse, we must spell your names correctly and we hope you compliment migrants likewise. Udhi nade jo Belfast  . Its dholuo language spoken by people of the Luo community. The Luos were split around the East African borders of Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda South Sudan by migration southwards and during the remapping of Africa in . That’s a story for another day. Luo is among hundreds of dferent African languages and dialects spoken in Belfast. Most Africans are in many cases authoritatively bilingual, spoken and written, no supernatural powers there, just a fact of le and that’s before you include the colonial language English, French etc, so effectively trilingual. In many encounters Africans residing in Ireland are often politely teased with the query, can you speak African please  Honestly, we don’t get offended by that question, generally the interlocutor would probably have assumed that “Africa” is a Pan-African language. I wish! The continent has over , languages, dialects and subcultures. Notwithstanding, the four countries listed above are just a small fraction of African nationalities in Belfast. There are many. The population of perhaps the total sum of  African countries as represented in Belfast could be in the thousands – although being hypothetical is not my cup of tea. West and North Belfast are probably the more African by headcount, followed by South and then East of the city. Some African countries are more visible than others here and we shall come to that in one of my future writings here at Andersonstown News. I just can’t wait. There is so much to explore in the lives of Africans in West and the rest of Belfast when you are inside the broth, it is the freshness you will get in this column moving forward, the smell, beauty and finesse of Africa. Having authored articles on migration in this past decade, it will certainly be a new environment to revisit, new faces, adults and also growing youthful population of first, second and third generation people who were either born in Africa or strongly identy with the continent because of family ties, social or legal reasons. n Elly Omondi Odhiambo is a freelance writer based in Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the ghost of policing past visits","story":"I WRITE this column on the th anniversary of the murder of Fearghal Caraher from Cullyhanna. Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ciaran also admitted driving home from hospital one night and crying his eyes out as he started thinking about le without his beloved girlfriend. \"Im the most positive person you could meet but when Nicole was in ICU, thats when my doubts kicked in,\" he said. \"That night in the car I was planning out her funeral in my head and thinking about horses and carriages.\"I was never so scared in my whole le as I was at that time. \"Nicole wasnt able to talk or move as she had to concentrate on her breathing.  data-dfpadtargetingGt of le: Nicole Adams with her le-saving drugs\"Once I got home and wised up, I realised that I had to keep fighting along with Nicole.\" With her condition deteriorating, the doctors said Nicoles only option was intensive care as she needed to be on le support or she would probably die.

Ciaran added: \"The doctors said her lungs were failing and they didnt have enough oxygen to give her. \"Her lung infection marker score has gone from a high of  to , the lowest its been in  years, which is unbelievable. \"While she was in intensive care she was on  litres of oxygen a day but now thats down to just one and shows how powerful the drug is.\" But Nicole was adamant that she did not want to be in intensive care even though she knew it was her last hope. \"Anyone I know with CF who went in there never came out again and when they brought me in I was screaming and covering my eyes because I didnt want to be there,\" she said.\"I was so scared going through the doors of ICU as I thought my le was over. \"Im so stubborn but when I saw my familys faces I just knew that I couldnt refuse my only chance to get better.\"Sitting back at home now Im so glad that I did it because otherwise I wouldnt be here.\" The rare disease Nicole picked up five years ago means she cannot avail of a lung transplant, leaving a deal between NHS chiefs and Vertex chief executive Dr Jeff Leiden as her only hope.Following a high-profile media campaign, Nicole was finally granted the lesaving drugs on compassionate grounds on December  and since then her recovery has been rapid. Ciaran and Nicole had booked to go on a three-week holiday in the sun over Christmas and while the festive period was instead spent in hospital, Ciaran says he is just relieved to have his girlfriend back in good health again. \"I cant even put into words how proud I am of her for coming through all this,\" Ciaran said. \"The drug has given her a second chance at le when she was knocking on deaths door. \"Im so glad shes here and now its the start of a new chapter for us. \"Nicole is the perfect example of why every cystic fibrosis patient must have Trikafta and we need every sufferer to have access to it because sadly she wont be the last person in this position.\" Nicole lost two stone during her six weeks in hospital and is looking forward to spending the next few weeks eating, sleeping and relaxing. \"When everyone  at this time of year is trying to lose extra pounds, I need to start putting them back on again. Its going to be a case of Netflix and chill. I bought all these new clothes before Christmas but they are hanging off me now,\" she laughs. All of Nicoles Christmas presents remain unopened but her family are planning a belated celebration with turkey and all the trimmings this weekend. While she is glad to finally be home, Nicole is also angry that she had to fight for so long to get her treatment. She is also calling for the drug to be made available to all sufferers as soon as possible. \"Im so glad I spoke up about cystic fibrosis as not a lot of people know about it, and proud that I showed people how hard it is, but thankfully Ive come out the other side better. \"But it shouldnt have been that way and I should have had Trikafta sooner.\"While Nicole now has her treatment, she has no idea how long for. \"Its on compassionate grounds and could be forever or just a month or a week,\" she said. \"I have enough medication for another month which feels so surreal but I can tell you this is nothing short of a miracle. However, its up to the drug company whether they want to keep me on it or not. \"They could pull the plug at any moment but I dare not think about it and just have to keep going. \"My aim is not to end up back in hospital for a long time except for check-ups and reviews.\"Nicole is also hugely grateful for all the care and support over recent weeks as she battled to stay alive. She added: \"Ciaran and I come from dferent religious backgrounds but Im so grateful to everyone from both sides of the community for their love, prayers and amazing support. \"Also, all the doctors and nurses who were outstanding and the extra care they give to the very sick people is out of this world.\"Les a gt and you cantit.\" The couple are now looking to  with renewed optimism after the last few weeks and hope Nicole will be well enough to attend a charity football match in aid of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust next month.

Ciaran is also focusing on ato his boxing career, which had been on hold during Nicoles illness. \"I rang my manager about arranging a fight so Ive been given a date in May in Manchester because before then I want to focus on Nicole getting better and off the oxygen for good,\" he added.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes.

CommentsParliament ‘misled’ over HS – review  deputy chairmanBelfastParliament was “misled” about the costs of HS, according to a report by the deputy chairman of the review .https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk parliament-misled-over-hs-review--deputy-chairman-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news uk dcac .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_fc-da-bd-f-dafa_EmailParliament was “misled” about the costs of HS, according to a report by the deputy chairman of the review ..pushLord Berkeley found that there is “overwhelming evidence” that costs for the high-speed railway are “out of control”, according to the Sunday , which has seen the report submitted to Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Based on independent analysis, the Labour peer puts the cost of HS at around at least £. billion and suggests that taxpayers are on course to make a £ billion loss on the project.HS Ltd’s latest official estimate of the project is £ billion.In the report, Lord Berkeley says he believes “that Parliament was misled on the question of HS costs” from the evidence he has seen, adding it is “highly unlikely” the legislation would have passedit had been given the “real costs figures by the Department of Transport”.The deputy chairman launched a scathing attack on the Government-commissioned review in November, after a leaked draft recommended that the high-speed railway should be built in full despite soaring costs.Lord Berkeley raised a series of concerns in a letter to former HS Ltd chairman Doug Oakervee, who was appointed by Mr Johnson to lead the review.At the time, the Labour peer declared he “cannot support its conclusions or recommendations” and “serious problems with its lack of balance”.In the report revealed by the , Lord Berkeley accuses HS Ltd of a lack of co-operation with the review .But a spokesman for HS Ltd said that they had provided “full co-operation” to Mr Oakervee and the rest of the review team.Writing in the newspaper, Lord Berkeley said: “Ministers must urgently look again at HS and either put a new budget to Parliament for approval, change the scope of the project or cancel it.”Stop HS, a campaign group against the high-speed railway line, said the report leaves the project so “irrevocably damaged” that there is no choice but to cancel it.Penny Gaines, chairman of Stop HS, said: “The case for HS has always been poor, and is simply getting worse.“In the last six months the expected cost has nearly doubled, the timescale massively increased and the environmental damage from HS is becoming increasingly apparent.“It is time for this white elephant of a project to be cancelled as quickly as possible.”The executive director of Greenpeace UK, John Sauven, said the Government needs to start listening to “HS’s critics”they were serious about climate change.“The protection of ancient woodlands must be a priority for rail development, alongside more cost efficient investment in rail links in the North and hard pressed commuter lines across the UK,” he said.The review was due to be completed this autumn, although the decision on the project’s future was pushed back by the general election.Phase one of HS is planned to run between London and Birmingham.It was initially planned to launch in , but a recent report by HS Ltd stated that this could be pushed back until .An HS Ltd spokesman said: “There have been many inidual views expressed about the HS project, however we await the publication of the Government’s official review.“HS Ltd has provided full co-operation to Mr Oakervee and his review team, and  the Government decides to proceed we have a highly skilled team in place ready to build Britain’s new railway.“Investment in a state-of-the-art high speed line is critical for the UK’s low-carbon transport future, will provide much needed rail capacity up and down the country, and is integral to rail projects in the North and Midlands which will help rebalance the UK economy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch five week old polar bear cub take tentative baby steps at zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We are comrades on the battlefield and we have become friends in battle.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ghaani, pictured in  speaking at the shrine of the late revolutionary founder Ayatollah Khomeini The Guard has seen its influence grow ever-stronger both militarily and politically in recent decades. Iran’s conventional military was decimated by the execution of its old officer class during the  Islamic Revolution and later by sanctions.A key driver of that influence comes from the elite Quds Force, which works across the region with allied groups to offer an asymmetrical threat to counter the advanced weaponry wielded by the US and its regional allies.Those partners include Iraqi militiamen, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels.In announcing Ghaani as Soleimani’s replacement, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the new leader “one of the most prominent commanders” in service to Iran.Soleimani had long been the face of the Quds Force. His fame surged after American officials began blaming him for deadly roadside bombs targeting US troops in Iraq.But while Soleimani’s exploits in Iraq and Syria were well documented, Ghaani remained much more in the shadows of the organisation.He has only occasionally come up in the Western or even Iranian media. But his personal story broadly mirrors that of Soleimani.Born on August ,  in the north-eastern Iranian city of Mashhad, Ghaani grew up during the last decade of monarchy.He joined the Guard a year after the  revolution. Like Soleimani, he first deployed to put down the Kurdish uprising in Iran that followed the shah’s downfall.Iraq then invaded Iran, launching an eight-year war that would see one million people killed. Many of the dead were lightly armed members of the Guard, some of whom were young boys killed in human-wave assaults on Iraqi positions.Volunteers “were seeing that all of them are being killed, but when we ordered them to go, would not hesitate”, Ghaani later recounted.He survived the war to join the Quds Force shortly after its creation. He worked with Soleimani, as well as leading counter-intelligence efforts at the Guard.Western analysts believe while Soleimani focused on nations to Iran’s west, Ghaani’s remit was those to the east like Afghanistan and Pakistan.In , the US Treasury sanctioned Ghaani, describing him as having authority over “financial disbursements” to proxies affiliated with the Quds Force. The sanctions particularly tied Ghaani to an intercepted shipment of weapons seized at a port in  in Lagos, Nigeria.Also in , Ghaani drew criticism from the US State Department after reportedly saying that “ the Islamic Republic was not present in Syria, the massacre of people would have happened on a much larger scale”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Ghaani had described Qassem Soleimani as a friend That comment came just after gunmen backing Syrian President Bashar Assad killed more than  people in Houla in the country’s Homs province.Then State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said at the time: “Over the weekend we had the deputy head of the Quds Force saying publicly that they were proud of the role that they had played in training and assisting the Syrian forces – and look what this has wrought.”In January , Ghaani indirectly said that Iran sends missiles and weapons to Palestinians to fight Israel.“The US and Israel are too small to consider themselves in line with Iran’s military power,” Ghaani said at the time. “This power has now appeared alongside the oppressed people of Palestine and Gaza in the form of missiles and weapons.”Ghaani is now firmly in control of the Quds Force, while Iran’s leaders plan to avenge Soleimani’s death.Whatever that plan is, Ghaani likely will be involved.“If there were no Islamic Republic, the US would have burned the whole region,” Ghaani once said."},{"url":null,"title":"rockets explode near us embassy in baghdad","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, between April  and March , , food parcels were given out. A spokesperson for the Hope Magherafelt Foodbank told the County Derry Post: “We have found that we are feeding more families this year with benefit changes relating to Universal Credit, along with low income which both continue to be the main causes for crisis. The five-week wait for Universal Credit is just too long.” googletag.cmd.push -year-old girl makes selfless donation to help young cancer sufferersA very kind-hearted little girl from Drumsurn made a wonderful gesture in September to help seriously ill children.Brave Kellie Stephens cut-off her Rapunzel like locks to allow wigs to be made for girls her own age suffering from cancer. The school child had cm of her beautul blonde locks shorn to have the task completed.The St Matthew’s Primary School pupil decided to take the task on two years ago after she learned about the Little Princess Trust charity. Wanting to help as much as possible she told her mum that she would grow her hair and then have it cut off to help those who need it more.Kellie’s mum Martina said: “It was completely off her own bat, she just wanted to do it all herself. She is very, very brave.“About two years ago she said to me ‘mammy, I don’t want to get my hair cut anymore, because I want to give it to the children who lose their hair when they have cancer.’“To be honest I thought the notion would go off her and we never really talked about it again. Then a couple of months ago she said ‘mammy, I definitely want to do this, I’m nearly ready.’“She grew it long and it’s lovely. She’s getting it cut off right up to a tight wee bob. She might even have enough hair for two wigs.” Workers without jobs as travel giant collapsesStaff at a Co Derry branch of former travel industry giant Thomas Cook were left without jobs at the end of September when the firm collapsed.

When it took hold the blaze was so intense that it gutted the home in a matter of minutes. The terrible incident followed on from Laura’s recent battle with breast cancer and the bad news was compounded further when the Housing Executive informed the family that no emergency accommodation was available in the area.But after an online fundraising campaign almost pound, was gathered in a bid to help the beleaguered family.Laura Ferris’ sister Maolisea McKee told the Derry Post: “We are just gobsmacked at people’s generosity. But, that’s Limavady to you, all kind hearted people who look out for each other. We can’t thank people enough.” googletag.cmd.push ‘Our Superhero Michael’At the start of October, the County Derry Post leads with a story of a brave boy who suffers from a rare medical condition.Michael O’Kane was born with Tracheo-oesophageal fistula , a condition which prevents sufferers from swallowing and that affects one in every , babies born.The Drumsurn lad had to undergo major surgery at just two days old and at one point doctors told his parents Suellen and Emmett ‘to prepare for the worst.’However, after a month long battle in hospital, Michael was allowed tohome to Drumsurn.Mum Suellen said she spoke to this newspaper in order raise awareness of TOF because Michael is still prone to episodes of choking – taking as many as five in a single day.“There’s no cure for Michael’s condition. He is fixed but he will never be cured. This is a condition for le that he won’t grow out of but simply have to learn to live with,” she said.As part of raising awareness of the condition a ‘Superhero Day’ was organised at St Matthew’s Primary School.“I decided on the superhero theme because Michael is our superhero,” the proud mum added. googletag.cmd.push ‘She would be so proud’ says winning GAA captainThe final front page of October’s County Derry Post saw the captain of O’Donovan Rossa GAC in Magherafelt take time to pay tribute to his late mother after the club won its first senior county title in  years.A special segment in the speech of Daniel Heavron included a heartfelt epitaph for his mum Brigid who was a former assistant treasurer of the club and who was regarded as the ‘mammy’ of the Co Derry champions.“I was praying to mammy that she would see it through,” Daniel said.Mrs Heavron passed away in  and the club’s youth officer, Enda Quinn, told the County Derry Post: “Brigid was a very valued member of our club and someone who is missed so much today. She would be so proud of everyone.” ‘A light in the lives of all who knew her’Mourners at the funeral of an -year-old Magherafelt girl who died awaiting a heart transplant were told that more organ donors would be a ‘fitting legacy’ to the bravery of the schoolgirl.Aimee Brady, a pupil at Spires Integrated Primary School died in hospital in October before a suitable heart donation became available for her. Archdeacon of Armagh, Canon Terry Scott urged those who had gathered at St Swithin’s Parish Church in the south Derry town that no other family had to endure the heartbreak the Brady family were now facing.Rev Scott said: “Aimee was just -years-old. Yet, in her short le, despite all the challenges and dficulties, she touched so many and made a dference to the lives of so many others.“She was a strong, brave and funny girl, full of le and spirit.”In a statement, the Children’s Heartbeat Trust said: “Aimee was one of the bravest, funniest and sassiest girls.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It also saw a change from the dominance of Slaughtneil and Ballinderry for most of the decade. The Emmets knocked out the Shamrocks before falling victim to Glens devastating running game in the semi-final. The Watties were unable to carry that form into the final where a Magherafelt team, while only winning by a point, were worthy winners of the John McLaughlin Cup. Away from the final, Banagher were the story that kicked the championship into le. Despite bring relegated without winning a googletag.cmd.push game, they dumped out Bellaghy and Swatragh before pushing Adrian Cushs side to the pin of their collar in the semi-final. - Daryl McDermottAfter picking up the intermediate goalkeeping spot last year and making the hurling selection, Sticks once again is honoured.He was the undisputed goalkeeper of the year. His kicking against Bellaghy was pin-point and ied. In their win over Swatragh he made two fantastic saves and Magherafelt would have been out of sight only for his brilliance. [nd All-Star]  - Conor McCluskeyWhile also a very capable baller, Clucker was Adrian Cushs go-to marker in defence.He was asked to shackle Colm McGoldrick when Darren ONeill was black-carded. He kept a lid on Peter Hagan in the semi-final while getting forward to add to their attacking arsenal. Jack Doherty and Ryan Johnston also struggled against him. Two messy Benny Heron goals, neither of them his fault, was the only blot on a perfect season. [st All-Star] googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan RogersLike goalkeeper McDermott, Roger is a dual selection.In the Ballinderry game, he did a marking job on Ryan Bell yet still was able to get Slaughtneil on the attack with his trademark barnstorming runs from defence.His absence from full-back left the door open for Glen to exploit but his one man crusade almost pegged the Emmets back to nip the Watties. [th All-Star]  - Fergal DuffinGets the nod ahead of Darren ONeill and was a vital cog in Magherafelts defence.Came out on top of his battle with Ruairi Mooney and he blotted out Conor Feeney on Banaghers kick-outs. He held Kilcoos Paul Devlin scoreless from play but it was his county final performance that stands out. Two moments of bravery to win turnovers that resulted in Rossa scores.[nd All-Star]  - Gavin ONeillCharlie OKane kept Bellaghy guessing with Gavin ONeills jersey number positioning and in his new wing back role, he was immense. The fact that he nicked man of the match ahead of Conor Feeney and Tiarnan Moore spoke wonders of his performance.Swatragh didnt learn the lesson and once again ONeill bossed the game from wing-back, edging the battle with Patrick Kearney.[nd All-Star]  - Connor CarvilleWhen Glen licked their wounds after their hammering in the league by Slaughtneil, it was Connor Carville that learned the most. Following Sammy Bradley left Glen open.In the championship he was a dferent animal and when Oisin Hegarty was dismissed against Loup he was one of Glens leaders.Against Magherafelt he was one of the few to offer any help to goalkeeper Callum Mullan-Young. Glen didnt have enough like him. [st All-Star]   - Conor KearnsWith Michael McEvoy going under the kne, Magherafelts system of play needed someone to link their defence to attack. Kearns fitted the bill and thrived in his new found freedom. He handled an endless supply of ball against Coleraine and didnt look back. His goal proved to be the vital score to sink Banagher. He didnt deserve his season to end prematurely with a harsh black card against Kilcoo. [st All-Star] - SENIOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR  - Danny HeavronThe Rossa skipper once again poured out everything he had for the cause.His influence helped them see off Coleraine and his moment of quick-thinking put Kearns through for the all-important goal against Banagher. In the final he pressed high on Glens kick-outs to turn the game. Against Kilcoo he once again linked the play and was missed during a brief spell at full-forward. [st All-Star]  - Ciaran McFaulAfter Loups goal it was McFauls point that made Glen believe again. When they were staring into a defeat against Lavey, he led the way again and his display of fielding was simply awesome. Against Slaughtneil he plucked another one from the air, just when Glen needed a moment of inspiration.Not as influential in the final as was required. Without him, Glen wouldnt have got there and given three more seconds. he wouldve forced a replay. [nd All-Star]  - Christopher BradleySammy led their scoring charts in the league and it was his accuracy that edged out a well-organised Newbridge in round one. When he found the net against Ballinderry, it cemented Slaughtneils place in the last four.Against Glen, he made their attack tick and was unlucky not be their last gasp hero but Oran McGills left foot denied him a potential winning goal and a county final spot.[rd All-Star]  - Danny TallonDespite being captain, he was replaced against Loup but took it on the chin and came back stronger.Kicked a point against Lavey and plucked two vital balls from the skies as Glen dug themselves out of another hole.He gave Keelan Feeney the runaround in the semi-final. A hamstring injury shadowed his preparation for the final, but he saved his best for last and put in a performance that deserved to lt the John McLaughlin Cup.[st All-Star]  - Emmett McGuckinHis goal against Coleraine kicked off Magherafelts route to glory, as he delivered in spades.Revelling in the freedom of midfield he made his side tick and his performance in the final, along with that of Odhraacuten Lynch, ended the Rossa famine. His scores broke Glens hearts.Kilcoo had no answer to him at full-forward and he didnt deserve to be on the losing side. [st All-Star]  - Francis KearneyDaniel McKinless and Paul Gunning can count themselves unlucky to miss out.Francis Kearney carried his league form into the championship. He was in red hot formover Swatraghs two games. If the Swa had been able to get a handle on Banaghers attack, his scoring power wouldve taken them to the last four. [st All-Star]  - Alex DohertyAnother contender for player of the championship, he pinged - from play and was Glens top scorer.His goal against Lavey was sensational. After beating three men on his road to goal, he powered to the net for the goal that arguably changed Glens season. Scoring - off Karl McKaigue is no mean feat and he backed it up with four mighty points in the final. [st All-Star]  - Tiarnan MooreOne year on from tearing intermediate defences apart, Moore was at it again. His tally of -, with one assist from brother Niall, tore the Bellaghy defence asunder as he revelled in the open spaces.While he didnt score against Swatragh he pulled their defence all over the place as Banagher once again made hay.His frightening pace was one of the stories of the championship.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Meanwhile, EU leaders drown migrants in the Mediterranean, provide arms and political cover for dictatorships infor contracts with European companies, collude in Zionist assaults on Palestinian rights, etc.But everywhere, too, there is revolt. Chile, Hong Kong, France, Catalonia, Iraq, Sudan, etc, have all seen millions in the streets against the rule of the rich over the poor. In Lebanon, a by-word for communal hostility, Sunni, Shia, Christians and Druze have come together in angry array against the elites.Young people in unprecedented numbers have swamped cities demanding radical action to save the planet.Long struggle has finally won abortion rights for Irish women, North and South, and equal marriage in the North.There’s evidence everywhere that the isions which keep the working class enchained can begin to melt in the heat of struggle.In Ireland, the battle lines are drawn between those who want unity of the oppressed in pursuit of a better world and defenders of the riven status quo.The battle is unequal. The forces of the Right seem in the ascendant. But  has also shown the depth of resilience and the fighting capacity of plain people. The magnitude of the masses shouting out across continents has had the character of a global uprising.It is in this that socialists find hope for the future, across all Ireland as throughout the world.Orange and Green politics are useless when it comes to defending the NHS, resisting job losses, opposing welfare “reform,” fighting for civil rights for all, etc.What’s needed is to drive forward and expand the emerging struggle all around us. The same perspective lights the way to Irish unity.Homeless deaths on the streets, hospital patients stacked in corridors, teachers run ragged in over-crowded class-rooms, workers denied union rights, State corruption, a suicide epidemic - all these apply in equal measure North and South. It is by bringing these struggles together that we can transcend the borders within and between us.We in People Before Profit put all our trust in the indomitability of the working class of the world.Pessimism is a weapon to be used against us. We don’t believe we won’t win. Here and everywhere, the vanquished of today will be the victors of tomorrow.These are the perspectives which guide us in our work in trades unions, civil rights campaigns, the environmental movement, and in all .We urge all who sympathise with this approach to join us in struggle in the year to come. googletag.cmd.push Eamonn McCann googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He believes the EU budget will be “signicantly reduced” following the UK’s departure, which, coupled with the possible admission of other countries into the EU, will have a detrimental impact on the Republic of Ireland moving forward.The recent Westminster election results can be interpreted as giving voice to the exasperated desire of many people to see a Stormont Government up and running to try and deal with the extreme circumstances that abound in health, education and other sectors in our society. Another element has been seized upon by some in declaring that for the first time there are more Nationalist MPs than Unionist MPs elected. This disguises the more fundamental point that while some Irish republicans go into a frenzy about demographic change bringing with it the so - called inevitability of a united Ireland, they have avoided actual election results which show nothing like that outcome. In this year’s election there were first time voters who had not been born when I was first elected to Parliament in . In that Westminster election  years ago, the united Ireland parties, Sinn Fein and SDLP, obtained .% of the vote, while at last month’s Westminster election Sinn Fein, SDLP and Aontuacute got .%. Support for those parties that advocate a united Ireland is less now than it was when I was elected in . The much vaunted “demographic change” that republicans repeat ad nauseum has worsened their chances not improved them. The other more practical problem they face is that just as any pan unionist vision of an ultimate solution such as total integration within the UK wouldnt have been possible or practical whatever the majority voting for it may have been, just so any pan nationalist vision of an ultimate solution of a United Ireland would fail by the same criteria. The other big ticket item next year will be the Brexit proposition. Again, those who advocate staying in the EU through an impossible united Ireland have not been open about what lies aheadthey were to be successful. The EU budget will be signicantly reduced on an annual basis by the UKs net contributions of approximately poundbillion. Countries such as Serbia and Montenegro potentially joining in the next five or six years means the budget would become even more hard pressed let alone any fancul notion that an Independent Scotland would be re admitted pressurising those net contributing countries, such as the Irish Republic, for more money again. In short, staying in the EU in those circumstances would cost the Irish Republic much more than it is costing them now, anyone looking to join them should ponder that.  is the year we must press the new PM to give us a more equal United Kingdom as opposed to an even more expensive EU. googletag.cmd.push Gregory Campbell googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But, is the colder weather having an impact on your sleep  Are you struggling to drt off or waking up feeling chilly  If so, don’t fear. Holly Housby, sleep expert from Sealy UK, is here to help with her top tips for sleeping when it’s cold. Take a bathNot just relaxing, having a bath before bed can actually help to promote sleep and induce tiredness. Your temperature naturally dips at night as your body prepares for rest, beginning about two hours before sleep. When you soak in a hot bath, your temperature rises by a degree or two, and the rapid cool-down immediately after the bath imitates this natural decrease of your body temperature, which can help you to fall asleep faster. googletag.cmd.push Wear woolly socks, not cottonOften, poor circulation means that our feet are the first part of our body to get cold. Wearing woollen socks can help to keep you warm throughout the night - unlike cotton, wool is an great insulator and retains heat. And even better, wool has anti-bacterial properties meaning your cosy socks are odour resistant. Get movingExercising in the late-afternoon and early-evening can help to boost your body’s circulation and body temperature. However, it’s important to steer clear of exercise in the hour before bed, so as to avoid this having an impact on your sleep. googletag.cmd.push Say no to a night-capNot only does alcohol limit the amount of time you spend in REM sleep, the most restorative stage of sleep, it’s been suggested that alcohol can actually contribute to a lower body temperature. This is because alcohol causes your blood vessels to dilate, which takes blood and heat away from the core of your body. If you still want to enjoy a nightcap in the evening, make sure you only have one, and have it as early in the evening as possible to minimise its effects at bedtime. Upgrade your TOGIt goes without saying that investing in a thick, cosy duvet is important to staying warm during the winter nights. As a rule of thumb, a winter duvet should have a tog rating of . – . However, it’s also worth considering the filling.Wool-filled duvets can be quite chunky, making a good choice the cold nights. However, there are also synthetic duvets which are manufactured from fibres that are designed keep you warm while you sleep, which can be a great choice for those looking for hypo-allergenic options.

Brooke Scullions version of Lewis Capaldis Bruises prompted Will.I.Am and Meghan Trainor to turn instantly. They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. Each of the judges implored her to join their team. After telling Tom Jones that both of her grannies were single and Olly Murs that one of them fancied a toy boy, Brooke eventually settled on American singer songwriter Meghan Trainor. Meghan said she felt the competition was won already so impressed was she with Brookes talent. googletag.cmd.push Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. googletag.cmd.push After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts. If Brooke successfully negotiates the Knockouts she will earn a place in the live shows where the public will ultimately crown the winner of The Voice .

Brooke Scullions version of Lewis Capaldis Bruises prompted Will.I.Am and Meghan Trainor to turn instantly. They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. Each of the judges implored her to join their team. After telling Tom Jones that both of her grannies were single and Olly Murs that one of them fancied a toy boy, Brooke eventually settled on American singer songwriter Meghan Trainor. Meghan said she felt the competition was won already so impressed was she with Brookes talent. googletag.cmd.push Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. googletag.cmd.push After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts. If Brooke successfully negotiates the Knockouts she will earn a place in the live shows where the public will ultimately crown the winner of The Voice .

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments. On average, there is a four-year wait for knee and hip operations.The December  strike mdash which placed pressure on a range of hospital services and resulted in planned out-patient procedures and appointments being cancelled mdash placed increasing pressure on politicians restore the power-sharing assembly and executive at Stormont.During the industrial action, nurses did provide cover to ensure chemotherapy, intensive care and palliative care services at hospitals remained in place, while district nurses only attended emergency calls. A small number of domiciliary home calls were also cancelled.According to the South Eastern Trust,  outpatient appointments were cancelled and , others were not scheduled due to the recent industrial action.Ms Cullen said the local health service could not survive another winter, without improved pay and conditions for NHS staff.ldquoThe health service is in crisis, the senior RCN official continued.ldquoWe have , people on the waiting list for a hospital appointment and we have a severe nursing shortage, which is highlighted by the Nursing and Midwery Council figures.ldquoOur members have been out on strike to fight for patient safety and to improve conditions for everyone. Quite simply, we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the problems facing the health service. Another winter like this and the health service will be irreparably damaged..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Olympic.jpg","title":"Olympic bid for Border Cup glory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Olympic get a shot at redemption when they confront Rathfriland in todayrsquos eagerly-awaited Border Cup final showdown at Seaview.Last yearrsquos cruel penalty shoot-out defeat to all-conquering Crumlin Star in the final has plagued Olympic ever since and now is the time to put things right.Olympic have proven all the doubters mdash who predicted that they were one-season wonders mdashseriously wrong and they are back in the final on merit.Wins over Holywood , Bloomfield , Dromara Village , Dunmurry Recand Shankill Unitedhave made the rest of the league sit up and take notice for the second year in a row.Liam Sloanrsquos side are also going strongly in the Premier Section and are unbeaten after nine games. However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable. Seals give birth on the beach andyou get stormy weather, tidal surges and high spring tides, high pup vitalities can occur because seals are unable to thermo-regulate properly.ldquoSo,you have calmer conditions pups are going to have a better chance of survival.The mild lough islands of Strangford are a favourite spot for the seals to haul out in large groups, known as rockeries, now a regular sight for boat users.Mr Thurgate, who has worked on Strangford Lough for two decades, has seen the population steadily rise.He said: ldquoWe starting counting seals in .

However, since then it has expanded and swallowed up its few remaining rivals to achieve almost complete dominance of the poultry processing sector in Northern Ireland.The RHI scandal revealed how some in Stormont wanted to facilitate Moy Park’s expansion by using the overly-generous payments in the Renewable Heat Incentive, something which became a de facto backdoor subsidy to the company which is now ultimately owned by Brazilian multinational JBS.The company’s complex pricing structure meant that it was very hard for those without insider knowledge of the poultry sector to understand the scale of RHI’s benefit to Moy Park, with it appearing that poultry farmers were making a fortune from the scheme rather than most of that money ultimately benefiting the company..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Among files declassied at the Public Record Office in Belfast are a series of documents which have particular resonance, given what was to follow.In September ,GLT McWhinney, head of Rural Development Division in the Department of Agriculture, sent a restricted memo to Rural Area Co-ordinators.The civil servant told them that Moy Park director Eric Reid had phoned him with a suggestion of locating a processing plant in a disadvantaged rural area.He said that the company was in the final stages of consideration of a new plant to bulk produce chicken fillets for a major international outlet.He said that it would involve  jobs and involve a cost of about £ million. The memo said: “Moy Park are looking primarily at N Ireland sites but are not restricted to locating here.”He then outlined the company’s proposal: “Can Rural Development help  Moy Park are aware of the potential within the programme to put up shell buildings through local regeneration groups which the private sector can rent and fit out.“This releases more capital for the private company and gives the ‘community’ landlord a rental income stream plus local jobs and all partners can benefit.”However, Mr McWhinney noted that working with a company as big as Moy Park “does however raise points of scale and principle”.He identied that EU State Aid law was a key question, asking: “Could a community groupengage with a major poultry company in this way to attract jobs and investment to a disadvantaged area which would not otherwise be considered a suitable location  The project per se would not increase poultry production.”Council to give £m to republican museum with Narrow Water rle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He also asked whether the department could “engage with a specic company in this way”. And, asking a question which does not appear to even have been asked by civil servants or politicians during the engagement with Moy Park over RHI, he said: “What about other poultry firms ”He also questioned the £ million cost of the building “and that Moy Park is really not interested in anything smaller”.He said that the cost per job “appears to be reasonable and the risk element relatively low”.The following month, fellow official Liam McKibben said in a restricted memo that EU State Aid rules permitted grant assistance for poultry processing facilities but not for slaughtering or production of chickens.He said that it would be “prudent” to take the view of Whitehall’s agriculture department and the European Commission before committing to paying a grant.He said that “almost certainlywe are to go down the road you outlined this will create a precedent for other approaches both from the poultry sub-sector and the food processing sector in general”.He added: “The availability of such funds could be used to underpin direct and indirect Government support for the industry.”The files show that at the same time, Moy Park was in discussions with ROSAabout a processing factory in Jonesborough while also in talks with the IDB about locating the plant at Granville in Dungannon — essentially getting two arms of government to compete over how much subsidy it would receive.A document said that in a conversation with Janett Liggett from the Department of Agriculture, Mr C Jordan from Moy Park “admitted that in local public relations Moy Park does not enjoy a good reputation and companies like Tesco would be keen for their supplier to take a more pro-active role in the community”.At the time, the company had told government that it “wishes to expand on-farm poultry production” and that it had “developed a sophisticated contractual arrangement with producing farmers”.try catch  TrendingYoung man found collapsed in NI woodland on January  has been identied say PSNI -

Red meat also attracted a huge amount of unfair and unsubstantiated criticism from a range of ill-informed commentators and self interest groups..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button “Despite this backdrop, the UK red meat industry and its levy bodies made good progress in  in telling the true and positive story about our livestock and meat industry’s sustainability, contribution to climate change mitigation and its ability to help feed a growing global population’s demand for dietary protein.”“Looking to the main areas in the world where demand is growing it is encouraging that Chinese and UK authorities agreed a protocol in  for UK beef exports to China and our industry looks forward to servicing this important market in  and beyond.“As an organisation which provides services to beef and sheep farmers and processors LMC is acutely aware of the importance of the beef and lamb industry to the Northern Ireland economy, rural society and the countryside which we all enjoy.”The Commission’s chief executive confirmed that  is a milestone year when big decisions will be taken by UK Government around the future relationship of the UK with the EU, future UK trade policy with countries outside the EU and the future shape and funding of domestic agriculture policy in the UK. He continued: “Ideally we will have local Executive Ministers from Northern Ireland who can play an active role in influencing those policies and reflecting the economic and societal interests of Northern Ireland to Westminster decision makers.”Concluding, Mr Stevenson said: “LMC will continue to educate our young people in Northern Ireland schools on the importance of including beef and lamb in the diet. We will also promote the quality, versatility and values of Northern Ireland farm quality assured beef and lamb at home and abroad. “All stakeholders with an interest in the UK agri-food industry must work more collaboratively and strategically than perhaps they have ever done in the pastthe post-Brexit era is to be one that works successfully for our industry and delivers positive outcomes for society.”Meanwhile Farmers for Actionhas welcomed the new year with calls for Stormont to get back up and running. Such a development, it is believed, will make it easier to secure the introduction of guaranteed farmgate prices in Northern Ireland.

It only became compulsory for front seat passengers in the early s, and in rear seat passengers around the time I began to drive.Rapidly the UK moved from a culture in which most people in cars were not restrained into one in which almost everyone wore a belt..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Deaths and injuries were reduced radically.The other huge change that I notice since then is adherence to  mph speed limits.I remember well the casual way in which these limits were ignored, albeit with occasional moments when police patrols would be found at the edge of such a  mph zone.Drivers routinely sailed into a  mph zone travelling at mph or even  mph.I recall the sense of bewilderment that the wide Newtownards Road outside Stormont had such a limit, when a  mph or  mph limit seemed more appropriate.Now, like most other drivers, I am well used to travelling at exactly  mph along that stretch and it seems a reasonable speed.In the late s and the s, around  people died each year on average on Northern Ireland’s roads. Traffic levels have risen by a multiple of more than . since then, which means that such a fatality rate applied to current traffic levels would result in perhaps  deaths in Northern Ireland each year.Last year there were  deaths, the joint second safest year since records began in .The average number of deaths over the last decade has averaged only .A spate of tragic deaths in recent days shows that, as the authorities keep telling us, one death is one too many.But we should not make that point so forcefully that we lose sight of the stunning — simply stunning — progress that there has been in making our roads far safer.Ben Lowry: A conversation about Northern Ireland with Professor Brendan O’Leary Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"At least  people are alive each year who would otherwise be deadwe had not made such strides in safety.As well as greater adherence to speed limits and seat belt laws, there are many other reasons for the decline,Motorists are better trained, better aware of the risksand better aware of the penalties for drinking or killing someone.Cars are much better built and have to be maintained to a safer standard . Roads are better designed and have better markings.Even so, I can think of several measures that could help to drive deaths down closer towards zero.• Dashboard cameras within cars. They are already used to keep down insurance premiums of young folk, butthat was expanded, fewer and fewer people would dare to drive badly.• A  mph speed limit in streets with housing. The  mph limit is too high on such residential roads. Some years ago I was discussing this with an old school friend and we both agreed that  was too high for streets with lots of parked cars. We were travelling at well below  and put our theory to the test and began to increase our speed up towards the  limit and then stopped before reaching it, because it was obviously too fast with cars on either side. Yet lots of drivers still tear down such roads at that speed or higher.• Greater use of average speed cameras in  mph zones. Elderly relatives of mine live within such a zone and I often see cars seeming to roar past but in fact they might only be doing  or  mph. It is still too fast and so the limit needs greater enforcement.• A mph limit in rural roads. The current speed limit on single carriageway roads, denoted by the national speed limit sign in the picture on this page, is mph. This is far too high for most rural lanes and even for most B roads. • A mph limit on major single carriageway roads or a mph limit on the best of them, but onlythey have a  sign or  sign, to show that they are exempted from the lower  mph national speed limit. Also, far greater construction of overtaking lanes on major single carriageways so that motorists do not get struck behind tractors and tempted to overtake against oncoming traffic• A mph limit on dual carriageways that have deadly gap junctions in the central reservation, enforced by average speed cameras. The current A road in Co Down would have such a  limit until it is upgraded and the gap junctions removed .• A mph limt on dual carriageways that have flyover junctions . This would be enforced by average speed cameras.• An mph limit on motorways. This would be to let motorists know that it is not all puritanism, and that drivers would be allowed to go a good pace on our safest roads. It too would be enforced by average speed cameras so that  means , not . It would further be enforced by cameras to ensure motorists keep their distance between vehicles in front, and do not sit in the overtaking lane.• No new planning permission whatsoever granted for entries directly on A roads. And any existing entrances on to A roads that can be moved to adjoining lanes would be transferred to the quieter, safer road.Under my plan there would, in summary, be a lot more average speed cameras, which would become cheaper with technology advancements. Average speed cameras remove even the temptation to speed, because they cannot be evaded by suddenly slowing down for a fixed site camera, then speeding up again. But under the plan there would also be many more roads with mph limits , and some roads with higher limits still — the motorways.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But right now, more and more people in the Vale are being forced to our food bankrsquos doors.ldquoThis isnrsquot right.ldquoWhile our help is needed, wersquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community without enough money for food are able to access emergency support.ldquoOur vital work in the community has only been possible because of the incredible generosity shown by local people who have donated food, time and funds.ldquoThank you.The Vale Foodbank is particularly in need of UHT milk, fruit juice, tinned meat, and tinned vegetables.The charity has asked for festive donations to be donated in early December at the latest, to ensure volunteers have enough time to process and distribute these donations to people before Christmas. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.
