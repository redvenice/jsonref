Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region has been thought to contain Napoleon\u0027s loot ever since the 19th century, but Ryzhkov says this is a fraudAccording to a member of Napoleon\u0027s staff, Philippe-Paul de Ségur, the loot was hidden in Lake Semlevo in the Smolensk region in western Russia.Scottish novelist Sir Walter Scott added further fuel to the rumour when he mentioned the treasure in his 1825 biography, \u0027The Life of Napoleon Bonaparte.\u0027Historians and archaeologists have scoured the area of Lake Semlevo ever since and the legend has been bolstered by huge troves of weapons and ammunition that have been uncovered around the lake.The Russian paper reported that the Soviet\u0027s made extensive efforts to retrieve the treasure in the 1960s and 1970s to no avail.But according to the Moskovskij Komsomolets paper, Vladimir Poryvaev who has hunted the treasure for years says Ryzhkov\u0027s story is absurd.He cited the idea of 400 wagons as particularly outlandish, saying this \u0027secret\u0027 convoy would have stretched for miles.Poryvaev also mocks the idea asking what scuba gear Napoleon\u0027s men had for their complex underwater burial at the the bottom of an icy lake in the middle of winter.Russia searches for Napoleon\u0027s gold - BBC News"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/15/17/4E4757A800000578-0-image-m-35_1531670840554.jpg","title":"Scottish waitress 21 filmed twerking ambulance denies damaging property","story":"    Ms Bell (pictured) has denied causing damage to property A Scottish waitress who allegedly twerked on an ambulance after England\u0027s World Cup quarter-final win over Sweden denied damaging property today.Larissa Bell, 21, is accused of waving her arms in the air as she stood on top of the emergency vehicle near London Bridge station while being cheered on by boozed-up football fans on 7 July.Scott Dennett, 25, Singaporean Perry Kangyue Jian, 26, and James Elton, 27, were allegedly part of the crowd which spilled out into Borough High Street to celebrate the 2-0 victory. The rapid response car was left with a shattered windscreen and dents in its bonnet.Bell, of Glasgow, Dennett, of Thornton-Cleveleys, Lancashire, and Jian, of Poplar, east London, all denied damaging property at Inner London Crown Court. Elton, of West Hampstead, north-west London, is yet to enter a plea to the charge.

The great Robert Capa would tell me I’m not getting close enough. Can some intensive coaching help me to raise my game?It’s a Sunday morning and I’m on Rue Mouffetard, a bustling market street in Paris, skulking behind a pyramid of nectarines. My sights are set on a fluffy black poodle nuzzling the ankles of its owner, a stripey-trousered woman of a certain age.Raising my camera to my eye, I risk a few furtive shots but, irritatingly, the poodle keeps scampering out of the frame. Its mistress is engaged in animated banter with a guy tending a rack of roast chickens. Promising. But, spying the camera, he throws his hands in front of his face.This is the trouble with street photography. Like many amateur camera operators, I’m a fan of the genre and the vintage work of stars such as Saul Leiter and Elliott Erwitt. But the logistics are challenging. Since buying my first DSLR a few years ago, I have spent many hours pacing the streets of London in search of inspiration. People tend not to like a total stranger following them around taking photos of them and, as I am acutely aware of this, my compositions are frequently rushed and taken from peculiar angles. Magnum photographer Robert Capa’s adage, “If your photos aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough,” certainly applied to me, but I had no idea how to overcome it.Then, one day, inspiration struck. I was listening to the photography podcast Hit the Streets when I heard its host, Valérie Jardin, mention upcoming workshops in Paris. These sounded like exactly what I needed. Now I’m here, I’m not so sure.“Remember, you’re not doing anything wrong,” Jardin, an energetic Frenchwoman, had told me. “You’re documenting life on the street, which is important. It’s best to start with a busy, touristy area where everyone has a camera. You’ll feel more invisible. Not only is a lot happening, with plenty to catch your eye, but you’ll be more at ease because of the crowd.”The trouble is, that morning I’m not feeling remotely at ease. “If you’re nervous about going in close to people with your camera, photograph dogs – owners are always so proud of them,” Jardin had suggested. “Compliment the dog and then you can work your way up to asking for a photo of its owner, too.” I snap the poodle again. The poodle looks confused. Its owner gives me a look that doesn’t encourage me to ask if she would like to be photographed.We had begun the workshop by going through some of Jardin’s work: highly stylised images of impeccably dressed people with a strong emphasis on dramatic natural light and silhouettes. Within minutes, my creative lethargy dissipated. It hadn’t occurred to me before, but much of contemporary street photography and the way it is taught has a kind of “Gotcha!” sensibility, where the onus is on viewing subjects as victims. Jardin’s beautiful photos, while still obviously “street”, have a different quality. They are photos you might want to hang on your wall rather than expect to see in the pages of a tabloid – a far cry from the in-your-face quality seen in the work of star snappers such as Bruce Gilden, Martin Parr and Dougie Wallace.“I’m more and more resistant to calling myself a street photographer,” Jardin had confided. “I’m recording life’s beautiful moments, ordinary moments that become extraordinary when you freeze them in time. Street photography is one of the most difficult genres to master. You have no control over what other people are going to do, only control over your gear and your vision. There’s a lot of luck involved, but without vision, luck doesn’t matter.”When Jardin takes me on to the streets, the biggest surprise is observing the simplicity of her camera settings. I suppose I had imagined there was some secret shutter-speed formula that would render light beautifully, if only someone would share it with me. In fact, she scarcely bothers with manual mode. Instead, her laser-like attention is on the people around her, and on the light.“I never bring the camera to my eye it’s all done here,” she says, tapping the LCD screen of her black-and-silver Fujifilm X100F. I would never have tried what the experts call “shooting from the hip” if I had been on my own, believing it was beyond me. But my coach is confident I can do it. “The trick is to always shoot at the same focal length in time your eye will know exactly what you’re going to get before you even press the shutter.”Several shots of cobblestones and a dog’s front paws later, I’m getting the hang of it. One thing is for sure: people are a lot less bothered by my presence without a camera at my eye. I sneak a glance at a woman engrossed in Le Journal du Dimanche and press the button. Now that I’ve turned off my camera’s beeps, as suggested, things are a lot easier. I relax and start to have fun. “I like the humour in your work,” declares Jardin, when we review our images. “Keep at it – I think you will get there.” I’m not even sure where “there” is, but I feel 10ft tall.Back home, I resolve to be bolder about the photos I take. But despite following Jardin’s advice to practise a different technique every day (silhouettes one day, panning the next), the discipline quickly becomes aimless and I feel deflated. Why am I doing this?Jardin agrees to give me some Skype coaching. During our first session she says I’m facing a common problem. “If you go aimlessly into town with your camera, you’re just going to get the same bunch of average shots of the same boring thing. What you want is a project that you can do anywhere, even if you’re travelling or the weather is bad.” Jardin has several such projects on the go, including people looking at modern art, beautiful smiles of strangers and hands. “The subject itself doesn’t matter, but it should be something that you’re naturally drawn to, so that you keep going with it.”Suitably inspired, I choose two subject areas that I’m always drawn to: London shoppers and reflections. Jardin books me in for a follow-up session so she can assess what I’ve been up to. I must admit, this accountability in itself makes a huge difference. Just as I am slacking off on the whole thing, up pops a message from her: “How’s the project going?” That is enough to get me moving again.Over the course of a month, I assemble two albums and then narrow them down to five photos each. Some are new, some are images I had previously taken that fitted the theme. This is another thing I learned from Jardin – photography isn’t just about taking photos. You want to create a body of work by editing your images and grouping them together in a meaningful collection. Like a lot of people, I take loads of photos and then do nothing with them.At our final critique session, I must confess that I’m a little nervous. There is a particular mortification associated with presenting a photo to an expert and awaiting feedback. Whatever genre you favour, quite a lot can go awry with an image. Certainly, Jardin is robust in her observations about how each of my shots could be improved and is quick to pick up on recurring technical errors and bad habits. “If you’re going to shoot people from the back, it has to be super-interesting. Far better to run ahead of people and catch them from the front further up the street.” And: “Again, you’ve shown too much detail of the surrounding buildings. I wish you’d gone in closer to your subject. If you can’t bear to do that, then get a longer lens.”But she is also warm-hearted and generous with her praise.“I love, love, love the man outside the shop with the bag. He looks as still as the mannequins in the store. And the Café Rouge one, it’s my favourite. I love the interconnection between the human element and the backdrop. Bus, red building, red coat. That shows you visualised the strongest possible subject and then you were patient.”She even goes so far as to suggest I enter some shots to a photo competition, something I would never have thought about doing. She also puts things into perspective: “You should be really happy to have got so many good shots. Many street photographers believe a strike rate of one in 100 is good going.”Ultimately, having a professional scrutinise both my work and my working methods has been a revelation. It has made me stop dwelling on the skills I lack (such as photographing anything that is moving faster than a snail). Instead, I’ve started to appreciate what is unique about my photos: colour, drama, texture things I would never have noticed on my own.Most significant of all about working with a creative coach is that, because they take you seriously, you start taking yourself seriously. I now print my photos and have produced cards using the images. I’m also going to start a photography foundation course in 2019, something I previously lacked the confidence to pursue. Who knows, I might even start a project about dogs and their owners.Valérie Jardin is the author of Street Photography: Creative Vision Behind the Lens.

In 2016 the library, which is a volunteer-run charity, was threatened with eviction from the building in Southwark where it has been housed for three decades, when the council announced it would begin charging rent – increasing its costs from a £12,000 annual service charge to £30,000 a year.A petition signed by 16,000 people and a “read-in” protest from the public led to a reprieve, but the building is now due for redevelopment, with the library needing to leave the premises in spring 2019.While an alternative space in Peckham was found by Southwark council, the library needed to raise at least £30,000 to finance the move. Almost 800 supporters have now helped it to raise the funds, with library staff now looking for a further £12,000.Fundraising coordinator Magda Oldziejewska said the extra £12,000 would cover additional costs, including archival storage, blackout curtains and painting and decorating. Staff are also looking for volunteers to help sort through a backlog of 4,000 uncatalogued book donations ahead of the move.In 2012, the Women’s Library, an archive of women’s history founded in 1926, was threatened with closure, but was saved when the London School of Economics stepped in to house it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/667b249143dba391c3d52be85e963d91223fd4bb/0_49_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49724ee4478a941a6d248244689fa89b","title":"leading the entertainment pack uk print book sales rise again","story":"Bestsellers including Michelle Obama’s Becoming cited as reasons for success, with industry voices praising sector for fourth consecutive year of growthFormer first lady Michelle Obama’s memoir, Becoming, which sold more than half a million copies in less than two months, has helped the UK book market to a fourth consecutive year of growth.Becoming was the most valuable title of the year, according to the Bookseller: taking £7.7m in sales, it topped the charts for four consecutive weeks and took the Christmas No 1. But it was not the year’s bestselling book: Becoming was outsold in the non-fiction market by Adam Kay’s memoir about life as a junior doctor, This Is Going to Hurt, and by 2018’s overall top seller, Gail Honeyman’s debut novel Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine.The Bookseller’s editor Philip Jones said the growth was “another glitch in the eye of those pundits who thought physical books would go the way of the CD, DVD or even vinyl. The turnaround at Waterstones – once owned by HMV of course – and the continuing success of the smaller chains such as Blackwell’s, Daunt and Foyles, and the large numbers of independent bookshops shows how the high street might yet be saved by proper customer-centric retailing.” He identified Trump as the major trend in non-fiction, with the year bookended by Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury and Becoming.In fiction, he said, so-called “up-lit” – uplifting fiction – was “the counterpoint to the wider gloom”, led by Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine. The Nielsen figures do not include ebooks and audiobooks, and Jones said he expected that both of these sectors had also grown over the last year, “particularly the audiobook market, which is really on the charge”.“When you consider the Nielsen-measured print-book market alongside all those bits of the sector we do not have numbers for – including direct sales, sales though bargain bookstores or the discount supermarkets, the secondhand market, plus digital – it is pretty clear that the book is the unassailable leader of the entertainment pack,” he said.Literary agent Jonny Geller responded to the news on Twitter: “We punch well above our weight as an industry and cultural light and must continue to invest in writers and writing. Believe in the power of books.”He told the  that he had been struck by the range of bestsellers in 2018: “Publishing is a great shop window of one of this country’s greatest exports – creativity. We tend to underestimate the power of our writers internationally as more UK-originated material becomes TV and films and dominates bestseller lists abroad.“Print sales underpin publishers’ profits, so let’s hope they use that to invest in new and innovative voices in 2019 – and share the newfound spoils with the writers in a flourishing audio sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e42c99ca3289e61c97739fc90d876970ec453e41/0_13_2985_1791/master/2985.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b24e10fb1bc43ca0fe91460f2da093f0","title":"tell us how would a no deal brexit impact your business","story":"What issues do you anticipate for your business or sector should the UK leave the EU without a deal?Government ministers released a batch of papers in September warning of the risks of leaving the European Union without a deal.Impact papers stressed some of the day-to-day effects after Theresa May chaired a special meeting of the cabinet focused on how a no-deal outcome could be handled.We would like to hear from you if you work in a sector you think may be affected by a no-deal Brexit and to find out what the potential impact would mean for you.Tell us a little about what you do and how your reading of the situation means your business or sector could be affected in our encrypted form below.

Women will still be in the minority on the 13-strong FPC when Gadhia and Bowe take up their posts, with Elisabeth Stheeman currently its sole female member.The Bank of England has been criticised for a lack of women and ethnic minorities in senior roles.The Bank’s interest rate-setting monetary policy committee has only one woman, Silvana Tenreyro, among its nine members. The Treasury came under fire last year when it opted to appoint Jonathan Haskel to the MPC, despite being the only man on a shortlist of five candidates.The Bank faced further scrutiny after the MPC member Ben Broadbent was accused of using sexist language when he described the UK economy as “menopausal”.Politicians are concerned that few women could be candidates to take over as governor. The Bank has been led entirely by men throughout its 324-year history. Two of parliament’s most influential select committee chairs, the MPs Rachel Reeves and Frank Field, have said the Treasury needs to work harder to find women who could succeed Mark Carney. Reeves recently told the  that the Bank “has not done enough to recruit, train and promote talented women”.The Treasury said on Thursday that Bowe and Gadhia were among five women and three men shortlisted for the FPC position. Candidates were whittled down from 42, 20 of whom were women.“The Bank and the Treasury must be open to people from different and erse backgrounds to ensure that progress continues. The Treasury committee will continue to monitor this extremely closely.”Carney, who serves on the FPC alongside the Financial Conduct Authority CEO, Andrew Bailey, said he was delighted by the appointments. He said Bowe has “led the way in developing and embedding better standards of conduct across the banking sector”.However, Bowe recently admitted that little progress had been made on fixing the UK’s poor banking culture, five years after the major inquiry that sparked the creation of the Banking Standards Board.“Her experience in the private sector and handling some of the biggest regulatory challenges of our times will also be extremely valuable to the committee’s deliberations in the coming years,” Carney added. Bowe is also known for chairing the communications watchdog Ofcom from 2009-14.The governor also welcomed the appointment of Gadhia, who recently stepped down as CEO of Virgin Money after its takeover by CYBG.“Jayne-Anne brings deep and relevant experience in retail banking and her successful business career,” Carney said. “In her public policy she has championed the transformative impact of adopting new technologies and of greater ersity within the workforce of the financial services industry. We also greatly look forward to her contributions to the work of the committee.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff589a4bd3d355ebe9bfba8f606718f89c5b2bca/0_173_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77b56561f9c131d8aa32d1b6b65d7f21","title":"uk construction sector ends 2018 on weak note amid brexit worries","story":"Industry activity hits three-month low in December as uncertainty continues to riseThe UK construction sector ended 2018 on a weaker footing, hitting a three-month low in December amid fading demand for commercial projects and the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit.According to the MarkitCips UK construction purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which is closely watched by the Bank of England and the Treasury as an early warning gauge for the UK economy, the building trade suffered a slowdown in activity in December.The PMI dropped to 52.8 in the final month of the year, from 53.4 in November, missing economists’ forecasts. A reading above 50 indicates growth.The latest snapshot revealed construction companies hit a weaker patch during the last month of 2018 as new orders increased at a relatively subdued pace, while there were some reports that wet weather disrupted work.The slowdown largely reflected softer activity in the commercial sector at a time of rising uncertainty for businesses considering building projects with less than 90 days to go before Brexit.Tim Moore, the economics associate director at IHS Markit, said: “Subdued domestic economic conditions and an intense headwind from political uncertainty resulted in the weakest upturn in commercial work for seven months.”Howard Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club forecasting group, said: “Some companies’ willingness to commit to major new projects at this stage is being limited by Brexit uncertainties and concerns over the economy.”While activity faded in December, strong demand for residential property among first-time buyers helped support the levels of work for housebuilders, while civil engineering activity rose at the quickest rate since May 2017.Despite concerns over delays to major civil engineering projects, such as the building of Crossrail in London, analysts said construction companies would be hoping the government would push to get other infrastructure projects up and running this year.Companies in the PMI survey reported improved confidence in their outlook for construction activity for the year ahead, although economists said activity would likely remain subdued amid labour shortages.Max Jones, a construction specialist at Lloyds Bank, said: “While December was marked by further political uncertainty, the main challenges likely to be keeping construction bosses awake at night are more sector-specific, such as delays to projects being signed off and ongoing concerns about labour supply.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2deaf38b369e4b60dd1d07254d30b31e61251271/0_0_4471_2683/master/4471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ce90c2ee5938bcb62ea6dbac10acf3a","title":"stocks under pressure after apple downgrade shock business live","story":"Global stock markets weaken as phonemaker sparks growth fearsWe’re only three days into 2019, but it is already clear that the travails of the Chinese economy are set to be one of the major stories of the year.On Wednesday weak Chinese purchasing managers index data set the mostly negative tone for investors around the world, before Apple’s revenue forecast downgrade dominated Thursday’s trading.Weak US factory data from the Institute for Supply Management have added to the bearish sentiment, as new order growth slumped to its lowest since 2014.And the contagion has been felt across the world, with Apple suppliers and China-exposed companies feeling the pain.Thanks for reading the business live blog and farewell until tomorrow.

The new order reading slumped from a reading of 62.1 in November to only 51.1.The survey pointed to continued expansion, but at a much less robust pace, according to Timothy Fiore, chair of the Institute for Supply Management’s survey committee.

However, while we have long expected that an economic slowdown would eventually persuade officials to move to the side-lines later this year, we doubt that the Fed will be ready to abandon its rate hike plans when employment growth is still so strong and economic growth is still well above trend.Here is something (maybe) for the US investor bulls:Payrolls company ADP has reported that the US private sector added 271,000 jobs in December – far above the 178,000 expected, according to the economists’ consensus. The figures suggest that tomorrow’s market-moving non-farm payrolls data could beat current expectations of 177,000.The implications for stocks could be tricky: it could mean the economy is actually performing better than expected, helping company profits on the other hand, it could persuade the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy faster, eventually slowing growth.Either way, the number is “a welcome jolt to the market’s favored narrative that the economy is slowing sharply”, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added:To describe this as startling would be something of an understatement. The biggest increase in the ADP measure of private employment since February last year came out of the blue.US futures have recovered slightly as the New York markets prepare to open, but they still point to a tough day ahead for America’s biggest companies as investors try to judge how serious Apple’s surprise revenue downgrade really was.It follows a trading day in Europe dominated by reaction to Apple’s announcement, which shocked Wall Street and sent down the share prices of Apple suppliers and companies with major exposures to the Chinese economy – the makers of luxury goods such as Gucci owner Kering and Burberry prominent among them.In the UK, a quieter day for the City sees the FTSE 100 – now flirting with positive territory – led by Next.

The new and welcoming part of the story was that the government is launching a campaign in England to help parents choose lower-sugar options for their children.Wearing my nutritionist’s hat, blaming sugar alone is not the answer to childhood obesity. Still, every action in the fight against obesity does help. Keeping the sugar debate alive opens opportunities for much-needed action in areas that have received little attention. The levy on sugar in Mexico and recently in the UK revealed the results that are possible when there is engagement from governments and the food industry. In the UK, we are just at the beginning of a wider programme that will succeed only if important players such as the infant food industry become actively engaged.My interest in this began in 2009 when I became a mother and had the responsibility of choosing what to feed my twins. Being a nutritionist gave me a lot of advantages in navigating the baby feeding journey but also made me wonder what choices other parents have. What does the market offer when parents decide not to, or cannot, prepare baby food from scratch? I was so concerned that I decided to refocus my academic research on infant feeding.It became apparent that there was little information on the ingredients used in the formulation of commercial baby foods in the British market. My studies led me to report that the baby-food market was promoting the development of sweet preferences with the widespread use of sweeter vegetables and fruit, such as carrots and apples, rather than more bitter-tasting green vegetables. I also found that many baby-food companies were adding concentrated fruit juice or pureed fruit to make foods taste sweeter and that on average, dry sweet snacks had 26g of sugar per 100g. The food industry argues that it is using fruit and vegetables, which is true, but the problem is that the moment these fruits and vegetables are mashed and highly processed, the carbohydrates in the cell walls become free sugars.So I was seriously concerned to hear Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, defend adding sugar to infant food for reasons of “palatability” on the BBC’s Today programme on Wednesday. Making foods sweeter is a good way to ensure that children will choose them over other foods that are less immediately palatable. This, unfortunately, is what happens if babies are not offered less sweet foods. If the baby-food market offers highly processed fruits and other foods of a sweet nature, babies will have less opportunities to become familiar with a wider selection of foods in the future.In the UK, commercial baby foods are bought by at least one-third of parents. Alison Tedstone said on Today in the same interview that Public Health England, where she is chief nutritionist, that she was seeking to engage more players in the sugar reduction programme and that other measurements will follow in 2020. I will be eagerly following this progress, in particular the engagement of the food industry.Most importantly, we need changes to legislation to make it mandatory for the industry to align to a reformulation programme rather than relying on it to volunteer for one. Additionally, the government should listen to expert groups that recommend increasing the age at which solid food is introduced from four months to six months. Limiting children’s exposure to processed foods from an early age is something we all owe to children. Parents need a more supportive environment to give children a good start in life: less sugar, broader palates and healthier diets. • Dr Ada Garcia is a public health nutritionist at the University of Glasgow"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b17a22288a3752a25b761e5a5c9fa24946114d3/0_156_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be8120d2e2289277433b4733146c0a75","title":"fiona onasanya mp brexit westminster","story":"The disgraced MP has pledged to carry on despite her conviction. And Westminster is too preoccupied to remove herIt seems a strange thing to say about the disgraced Labour MP for Peterborough, but Fiona Onasanya is a lucky woman. Onasanya was found guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice last month. She faces a prison sentence. She is contemplating the ruin of a career that included her public aspiration to become Britain’s first black female prime minister. I’m not sticking my neck out very far to say that this last is not now going to happen.Onasanya’s offence: she repeatedly denied to police that she was behind the wheel when her car was caught speeding in Cambridgeshire in 2017. She refused to say who was driving. In fact it was Onasanya, who is a qualified solicitor as well as an MP. After a first trial failed to agree a verdict, Onasanya was found guilty at the retrial. She will be sentenced soon.Amazingly, Onasanya remains an MP, at least until then. This is the first reason she is lucky. Many of us would have already been fired by now. MPs, however, enjoy some privileges, often rightly (think for a moment about the potential for partisan mischief of a general zero-tolerance statute). So a conviction does not debar someone from being an MP unless they are sentenced to 12 months or more (the result of a law brought in after the IRA hunger-striker Bobby Sands was elected in 1981 while serving 14 years). So Onasanya is entitled to remain until she is sentenced.Yet her determination is unusual. In recent cases in which MPs have faced criminal trials, they have often resigned before trial or sentencing. The Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne, who also lied to police about a speeding offence, resigned as an MP after pleading guilty in 2013. During the expenses crisis, Labour’s David Chaytor, Jim Devine, Margaret Moran, Elliot Morley and Denis MacShane all quit before trial, and Eric Illsley did so before sentence. Conservative Nigel Evans stayed in the Commons while on trial for sexual offences in 2014, of which he was acquitted. Onasanya, convicted, remains.What is more, she is up for a fight. In an unabashed article for the Peterborough  last week, Onasanya wrote that “anyone who has been following the news” would know that politics has recently been busy and fractious over Brexit and welfare reform, and that she was fighting for Peterborough. There was zero acknowledgment that anyone who had been following the news would also know she had been convicted of a serious crime – and no suggestion she had let her electors down. Far from it. Onasanya has now compared herself to Jesus, whose conviction “by the courts of his day” was the start of “the next chapter in his story”.Her messianic defiance hasn’t gone unrebuked. As soon as she was convicted, the Labour party suspended her. Jeremy Corbyn said she was “obviously” not going to stay an MP. Onasanya’s article prompted the paper’s editor to say that, while he felt duty bound to publish her column because she was the local MP, she ought to resign. “She is no longer fit to represent the people of Peterborough,” Mark Edwards wrote. But represent Peterborough she still does. It will be fascinating to see how far she pushes her luck in the Commons when it returns on Monday.Because here’s the second reason Onasanya is lucky. Convicted MPs are actually very rare. No sitting MP has been imprisoned since 1991. That’s not because, as the expenses scandal showed, there have been no miscreants. It’s because, in the past 25 years, a story like hers would have had only one ending. Onasanya would have been driven out of Westminster, probably by the media alone, and also by political and parliamentary ostracism. But not, perhaps, any longer.That’s because Onasanya is a beneficiary of something new – the Brexit obliteration effect. With politics so preoccupied, stories like hers have slipped down the agenda to become merely a sideshow. Neither her peers nor the media have the energy or space to chase her down in the old way. The blanket of Brexit has settled across almost everything in politics, like a deposit of volcanic ash, making traditional politics all but impossible. That same blanket is heaven sent for someone such as Onasanya.Moreover, and let’s face facts here, she is a vote. In a knife-edge hung parliament, every vote matters. Last month, when Theresa May’s leadership was on the line, the Conservative high command quietly took Burton MP Andrew Griffiths and Dover’s Charlie Elphicke back into the fold. They did so because their votes for May mattered more to Tory whips than the claims of inappropriate sexual behaviour, which the MPs deny, that led to their suspensions.Labour has decisively cut its ties with Onasanya. But she still has a vote, and she is a vote for Corbyn’s pro-Brexit stance. That vote would be lost if there was an early byelection in leave-voting, marginal Peterborough, which Onasanya won from the Tories in 2017 by a mere 607 votes. You can see why Labour might be willing to wait. Not even the Tories want a Peterborough byelection right now, especially if Nigel Farage reverses his pledge not to run, turning the contest into a toxic verdict on May’s Brexit. In the end, it may take a recall petition to oust Onasanya.Britain can “turn a corner” and start a new chapter if parliament backs her Brexit deal, said May in her new year’s message. She makes that all sound so simple. Get Brexit sorted and move on. In essence it’s what Corbyn wants too, to get back to “real” politics after this long distraction. But as the Onasanya saga shows, such politics is asphyxiated by Brexit. Post-Brexit politics will be much more like Brexit politics than May and Corbyn think. There will be no quick turning of corners and no tidy new chapters, whatever MPs decide in two weeks’ time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf7336f6ff1694bf05d5d295fca572b47f679fc/0_286_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c35ded79e43e38f45684baea0aa6b0d9","title":"labour vote jeremy corbyn left grassroots","story":"We on the left of the party see that ignoring the will of the grassroots is a route straight back to the political wildernessAt the outset of 2019, the Labour left faces both an unprecedented set of opportunities and, potentially, an unprecedented crisis. As Theresa May hurtles towards what should be certain defeat on her Brexit deal, and the isions within the Conservative party deepen, the prospects for a transformative leftwing government this year look good. Even under the Fixed‑term Parliaments Act, it is entirely plausible that the Tories will lose control and be unable to prevent an election.If Labour’s leadership is shifting towards its members, then it is being very quiet about it.In an interview just before Christmas, Corbyn stated, without the explicit backing of any democratically established policy, that Labour would deliver Brexit in office. Free movement – the main issue of principle for most left remainers, and an issue on which Corbyn himself has been a passionate advocate – was junked in the 2017 manifesto and has yet to be resuscitated.Corbyn’s opponents want us to understand Labour’s Brexit debate entirely in terms of his personal views. Eurosceptic loyalists want us to understand it as a battle between Corbyn and the old Labour establishment in the parliamentary party and the media. Neither of these frames is adequate. With the support for both a fresh referendum and the left leadership so high, this must be understood as a battle within Corbynism’s support base. This is backed up by Momentum’s internal vote, in which a clear majority said they would back a referendum if no general election happened.For the Labour left, this is a problem on two levels. The first is about the short-term integrity of the Corbyn project. This year brings with it the possibility of an election and a left Labour government, but opinion polls do not show a clear lead for Labour. In order to survive intact, the left must deliver victory in any election, and to do this it will need a huge ground campaign, at least on the scale of 2017’s. In 2017, many remainers gave the party a free pass. But if the 2019 Labour manifesto contains a commitment to deliver Brexit, this will be a huge blow to the morale and turnout of its campaigners.The second, much deeper, threat to the left was illustrated perfectly just seconds after midnight on New Year’s Eve. Sadiq Khan’s EU-themed firework display on the London Eye was, mostly, an amusing method of winding up rightwing commentators. But it is naive to think that figures such as Khan are not also engaged in political positioning on the issue. Brexit is an issue that ides the left, and both the Labour right and would-be future leadership contenders will use it as a wedge in an attempt to peel away parts of the generally loyal Corbynite base.If we are not careful, the 2020s could be the decade in which a different narrative achieves the same result: a left leadership that ignored its members on the key issue of the day and enabled a policy that wrecked either its ability to win elections or its ability to deliver in government.The current situation does not have to be a problem for Corbyn and the left. Only the left has the answers to Brexit – because only it can offer the radical social and economic policies, and the alternative narratives on immigration, that will solve the problems at the root of the Brexit vote.The public want this moment to end – and Labour can win the argument that the only way to move on is with a final, decisive public vote on the realities of Brexit. As the sequence of events plays out in parliament, Corbyn can seize the initiative, destroy his opponents’ strategy and unite his party.• Michael Chessum is a freelance writer and socialist activist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b2ddb2b769f8c3f34184e0e18891ccbf7b0b72b/29_0_1050_630/master/1050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b708ba23b1eae5c1fa340d98c67e31b4","title":"space race china change 4 us russia moon","story":"China’s achievement in landing a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, announced by Beijing’s state media this morning, has ramifications that go far beyond the simple statement of this being a “first” for mankind. It puts China on the map of international space exploration on a par with the existing space powers of the United States and Russia – the European Union to a lesser extent – but also adds a new dimension. It is the first time a landing has been attempted on the far side of the moon, with the particular communications challenges this entails, and it has been a success.The first response from the US space agency, Nasa, was generous, as scientists to scientists: what China had managed was a “first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment”. The response in political and military quarters in Washington, as in Moscow, however, is likely to reflect trepidation. There is now a serious newcomer to be considered.China was late into space, sending its first astronaut into orbit in 2003 – 40 years after the Soviet Union and the US were embarking on their space race. Now Beijing has done something neither of the other two space powers has done – that may well be because they had other priorities for their space programmes, such as manned flight, human survival in space and the fascination with distant planets, first of all Mars. After Neil Armstrong became the first human to walk on the moon – a US triumph that provided some consolation for the shock that a Russian, Yuri Gagarin, became the first man to go into space – there was a sense that the moon had been “done”. Greater challenges awaited. Will that change now, and could the moon become a potentially contested territory?At a popular level, space has not lost its power to fascinate. The proximity of the moon and the mystery of its far side guarantee that China’s latest mission will command global attention beyond the scientific space fraternity. It will enhance China’s international standing, and could well inspire an interest in China and space among young people, as the US-Russia space race once did.The mix of admiration and anxiety that accompanied early Soviet space successes helped prompt the government of the then UK prime minister Harold Wilson to encourage (and fund) Russian teaching in the country’s schools and universities – and is one reason why I, and other Britons of my generation, had the opportunity to study Russian. Today the challenge, the excitement, and to some the perceived threat comes from a rising China – and now not just on planet Earth.An open question is how far China will be welcomed – or not – into the existing space “club”. After the no-holds-barred space rivalry of the US and the Soviet Union that constituted a part of the cold war, the US and Russia have settled into a more collaborative relationship in space that has largely withstood the worst of diplomatic tensions. The US suspended its space shuttle programme in 2011, but it has continued to send astronauts into space using Russian rockets, and the International Space Station has remained in use as a shared venture. Diplomatic expulsions, accusations of election interference and terrestrial disputes most recently over Ukraine and Syria have not affected cooperation in pursuit of national scientific and security interests in space. Space has remained a sanctions-free zone.It has taken more than half a century for US-Russia space cooperation to reach this point of relative equanimity, but the arrival of China as a serious player – graphically illustrated by its latest success – has the potential to disturb this. Will Russia, for instance, see China, with its recent successes and innovations, as a future partner in space or a deadly rival? The US – through its long-Sinophobic Congress – seems already to have made up its mind. Not only is it increasingly treating China as an economic and military competitor, but President Donald Trump recently ordered the creation of a new Space Command for the US armed services, suggesting the direction of his thinking here, too.So far, China’s precise ambitions for its space programme remain unclear. Establishing itself as a space power is surely one – but is it as a space power, or the space power? The equipment it has now sent to the moon suggests that communications and new natural resources are priorities. How far will the US, in particular, be prepared to watch and wait while Beijing potentially races ahead in these sensitive areas? Stand by for the US and Russia to take a new interest in the moon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e061b3902ea2f91dcfd31a045af367702b17f62/393_0_5999_3600/master/5999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c64beb45582b989238df6d6ee365928","title":"southbound capturing the complexities of the us southern states in pictures","story":"Life in the US south is the focus of a major exhibition at the Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art in Charleston.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

The woman on screen was her, but the voice was not hers.“Maybe the film had been dubbed into Italian and then dubbed back into English with another actor. Or maybe they didn’t like my voice and changed it to someone else’s,” she says in a voice of a more seductive, deeper timbre than the one I had heard on film.If Runacre’s voice has been erased, that would be fitting. Michelangelo Antonioni’s The Passenger, which is now being revived in a digitally improved version, is about changing identities. It could have been called The Man Who Mistook Himself for a Corpse. Its protagonist, played by Jack Nicholson, is a TV journalist called David Locke who is covering a civil war in a nameless African republic. He is sick of himself, professionally burned out, and his marriage is on the rocks. Then he sees a way out. He swaps identities with a lookalike man whose body he finds in a hotel room. Little does he know that the man he has become is a rebel gun-runner whom government hitmen want to rub out. He becomes, unwittingly at first, a politically committed freedom fighter rather than the detached observer of a struggle that he was in his previous life.Runacre plays Rachel, Locke’s estranged wife and a fellow journalist, whom we see in London with her lover, played by Steven Berkoff. Rachel and a colleague edit the footage her husband filmed in the desert, looking for clues as to why he died. “I’d just been in a fringe play with Steven called Hot Pants, but this was very different,” Runacre says. “And very different from the Hollywood villains Steven usually played.”Runacre’s role as the estranged wife is key to Antonioni’s film. In flashback, we see Rachel observing her husband as he interviews the republic’s dictator. After the interview, she berates him. “You involve yourself in real situations, but you’ve got no real dialogue. Why didn’t you tell that man …”“… that he’s a liar?” replies David.“I know, but those are the rules.”“I don’t like to see you keep them.”“He’s not true to his ideals. He’s lost his integrity,” explains Runacre over coffee at her flat in Chelsea, London. “He’s become a void, which is why she leaves him.”What does Runacre remember of being directed by Antonioni, the auteur of Blow-Up, L’Avventura and Zabriskie Point, who had a reputation for being difficult for actors to work with?The film is a masterpiece of enigmatic film-making from a virtuoso of silences.“He loathed explanations and cut them wherever possible so the film is almost silent. You’d work not knowing what you were doing. I thought, if he’s unhappy with what I’m doing he will tell me. On set, though, he wouldn’t really talk to you directly, but would often send over another person who would say: ‘The maestro would like you to do this or that.’ How lovely to be called maestro!”And what of Nicholson and Maria Schneider, credited only as the Girl, with whom Locke gallivants around Europe and Africa, all the while pursued by hitmen until the film’s tragic denouement?“It was an unusually quiet performance that Antonioni got out of Jack – very different from those excitable performances he gave in Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and The Shining.”Nicholson was accompanied during the 10-week shoot through Algeria, Spain and London by his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston.“He was notoriously promiscuous and, despite Anjelica being there, flirted with the girls on the set and they with him.” Including her? “No. I wasn’t interested. Instead, I formed a bond with Maria and her girlfriend Joey, an American photographer she was devoted to, and who was treated for psychosis soon after filming finished on The Passenger. Maria hated Hollywood and had had terrible experiences.”Schneider was just 19 when she appeared in Bertolucci’s notorious Last Tango in Paris (1972). “She told me she didn’t know in advance there were going to be nude scenes.” In the film, Marlon Brando’s character, Paul, rapes Schneider’s character, Jeanne, using a stick of butter as lubricant. In a 2007 interview, Schneider said the scene wasn’t in the original script, and that Brando and Bertolucci had told her about it just before they began filming.The director, who died earlier this year, later acknowledged that he had sprung the scene on Schneider at the last minute, because he wanted her onscreen humiliation and rage to be real. “I wanted Maria to feel, not to act,” he said.Runacre says: “She told me that she wasn’t actually buggered but that she was utterly humiliated by the way Bertolucci treated her.”After The Passenger was screened at Cannes in 1975, cast and director rose for the expected applause, only to be booed. “They were booing Maria for her scandalous performance in Last Tango. She got the blame, not Bertolucci.” It was in a sense a second violation.The Passenger didn’t win that year’s Palme d’Or and has gone into relative obscurity since. “One reason for that is that Jack bought the rights to the film and it was little shown.” Why? “Maybe he didn’t like his performance. He should have, though.” Runacre got the role in The Passenger because Antonioni had admired her debut performance in John Cassavetes’ 1970 film Husbands. She was a drama student when she auditioned to play a young English woman with whom Cassavetes’ character has a dalliance while on a trip to London with his pals, played by Peter Falk and Ben Gazzara, when the three of them are going through a collective midlife crisis after the death of a friend.“I got the part, then forgot about it, graduated and went to Scarborough and played in rep – stuff like Agatha Christie and Pinocchio. While I was there, we were all drinking Guinness, so I put on a bit of weight. Then I got the call from Cassavetes saying I’d got the role. I went back to London and Ben Gazzara said to me: ‘You’ve put on weight – better lose it.’ People wouldn’t speak that way now. But I slimmed down very quickly.”She loved working on the film, particularly an early scene of mostly improvised flirtation with Cassavetes. “It was a great introduction to film for me because I had been learning the Stanislavski method and here I was learning something very different from Cassavetes.”Husbands proved such a critical success that Cassavetes advised her to hurry to Hollywood. Why didn’t you go? “I didn’t want Hollywood upending my life – or the humiliations that Maria was exposed to.”Yet, while raising a family in London, Runacre worked with some of cinema’s leading directors. She appeared in Pier Paolo Pasolini’s The Canterbury Tales, Tony Richardson’s Joseph Andrews, Ridley Scott’s The Duellists, Nicolas Roeg’s The Witches, John Huston’s The MacKintosh Man and Derek Jarman’s Jubilee. In the last of these she played both Elizabeth I and Bod, a member of a roaming, murderous gang of anarchists that also included Toyah Willcox and punk icon Jordan.Of those film-makers, who was the biggest monster? “I’ve got no complaints with any of them, apart from Derek. He once shouted at me that I was driving too fast when we drove to Cannes to show Jubilee in 1978. He was right – I did drive too fast, so the car broke down. When we arrived, everything was stolen from our hotel room. And the people at the festival hated our punk gear – they thought we were ugly.” She continues: “I loved working with Derek, because it was all DIY, making our costumes and sets. You’d never get that in Hollywood.”Although she has acted throughout her career, on stage, film and TV (she was, for instance, Brenda Champion in Charles Sturridge’s 80s adaptation of Brideshead Revisited), Runacre reinvented herself as a visual artist in the 90s and later taught performance art in west London. Her installation At Least I’ve Got My Visual Stimulus is a Beckett-like piece featuring Runacre as a woman on stage talking unstoppably (the stimulant is telly), and her performance piece Bring Your Own Barbie involves the artist deconstructing a mannequin that looks a little like her. It is almost as if Runacre is erasing her body double – Antonioni would have appreciated its critique of identity. “You know what I learned from the film? We’re all passengers really.”Runacre, now 72 and elegantly clad in skinny jeans and a boucle jacket, tells me her next role will be in Alexandre Dumas’s The Lady of the Camellias at Waterloo East theatre in London in March.Does she wish she had become a Hollywood star? “Well, I certainly didn’t, did I? None of my films has gone on general release. Every one of them went straight to art houses. Not that I mind. I was in fringe theatre and then I had kids and then I got into making art. I’ve loved that life, and I still do.”• The Passenger is re-released on 4 January."},{"url":null,"title":"spiky superheroes far out sci fi and endless live action remakes a 2019 fanboy preview","story":"The Joker’s failed standup career and M Night Shyamalan’s Unbreakable conclusion provide some gnarly eccentricity in a year dominated by Disney deja vu and Hollywood rebootsIs the superhero flick entering its postmodern phase? Can Star Wars get superfans back onside? Is Will Smith still a bona fide A-list Hollywood titan? And will there really be an appetite for three Disney live action remakes in a single year? These are some of the posers that 2019 stands ready to answer, so let’s dig right in to Week in geek’s annual all-action preview of the big-screen hotties and notties for the 12 months ahead.For all those complaining that they cannot peep their head inside a multiplex without being accosted by musclebound hunks with magical abilities, things are unlikely to get much better in 2019. The Marvel big guns will roll out in April’s Avengers: Endgame, March’s Captain Marvel and July’s Spider-Man: Far from Home. The first will reveal how the world puts itself back together after Thanos’s climactic finger snap in last year’s Avengers: Infinity War, and the latter two take place before and after the big purple meanie destroyed half the galaxy’s intelligent life forms. Meanwhile, the main movie from Warner Bros-owned DC this year will be the ostensibly kid-friendly Shazam!, about a skinny teenager who is given the power to identify obscure pop music tracks transform into a hulking costumed crime fighter simply by uttering the name of the hokey golden age hero.However, the year ahead does offer up the tantalising prospect of film-makers reworking the superhero genre into new and more intriguing forms. Might the comic book movie be entering its “acid western” period?Take October’s Joker, which will exist outside the main DC Extended Universe. With more than a nod to Martin Scorsese’s classic mean-minded 1982 satire The King of Comedy (as well as Alan Moore’s graphic novel The Killing Joke), Todd Phillips’s origin story stars Joaquin Phoenix as the crown prince of Gotham, recasting the DC staple as a failed standup comedian who embarks on a life of crime. With a budget of just $55m and no prospect of this new Joker being shoehorned into encounters with other DC stalwarts, the project has the welcome air of a production unhampered by commercial concerns. Of course, if it breaks all box office records, expect the DCEU to be immediately repositioned around this version of Batman’s arch-nemesis, with the unfortunate Jared Leto unceremoniously jettisoned to a parallel comic book universe.Over at Twentieth Century Fox, still clinging on to its X-Men-tinted corner of the Marvel universe (at least until the studio completes its merger with Disney) the year’s main focus will no doubt be June’s Dark Phoenix. And yet August’s The New Mutants, from The Fault in Our Stars director Josh Boone, looks a whole lot more interesting. Centring on four young people with nascent powers who have been trapped in a mysterious facility by unknown forces, it stars bright young things Anya Taylor-Joy (The Witch) and Maisie Williams (Game of Thrones), and might mark a welcome shift for the superhero genre into full-on horror territory.Tipped to step even further over the line into gnarly eccentricity are M Night Shyamalan’s Glass (out later this month), the third instalment of a trilogy that began with 2000’s Unbreakable and continued with 2016’s Split, and Brightburn, which looks like a twisted blend of Superman and The Omen. The former will see Samuel L Jackson’s Mr Glass encountering the many kidney-curdling personalities of James McAvoy’s Kevin Wendell Crumb, while Bruce Willis’s David Dunn wrings his supposedly invincible fingers in angst. The latter sees Elizabeth Banks as a Martha Kent figure who rescues an all-powerful space baby from a fallen interstellar craft, only to discover her new ward is not the (Kryptonian) messiah, but a very naughty boy indeed.It looks like 2019 will most definitely be the year of Disney deja vu. Not content with rinsing the opening to the original Lion King for the live action remake’s trailer, the mouse house is also bringing back Dumbo (March) and Aladdin (May), using the wonder of new technology. Perhaps most intriguing here will be the prospect of noting whether the latter’s director, Guy Ritchie, can finally move on from his past, or whether the new Aladdin will emerge as a lovable cockney urchin with super slo-mo fight skills. Perhaps Will Smith, who plays the genie, will grant the film-maker’s wish for a hit after the disappointing double whammy of 2015’s The Man From UNCLE and 2017’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.The enduring high quality of CGI-led animated fantasy continues to astound, more than two decades after Pixar gave us Toy Story. Many fans felt that 2010’s Toy Story 3 brought the much-loved story to a suitable finish as Andy headed off to college and the toys escaped the fiery furnace for a new life with cheery toddler Bonnie. But here they are once again in the Josh Cooley-directed fourth instalment (June), featuring the uncomfortable-in-his-own-plastic-skin Forky (Tony Hale) as a new addition to the gang.Before that, in February, The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part will return us to the world of super-sarcastic playthings as Chris Pratt’s Emmet Brickowski is forced once again from his comfortably awesome existence to rescue Elizabeth Banks’s Wyldstyle from the clutches of a nutty intergalactic invader named General Sweet Mayhem. Finally, next month’s How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World will bring the adventures of Jay Baruchel’s high-flying Hiccup to a rip-roaring close. The viking chieftain and his girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera) are forced to hunt out the titular dragon homeland after coming up against a powerful new enemy, while his trusty steed Toothless finally gets his own love interest.Robert Rodriguez’s cyberpunk Alita: Battle Angel (February) is the movie James Cameron was so desperate to make, for so many years, that he eventually dumped it on somebody else. Rosa Salazar’s big-eyed Alita just looks downright weird in the trailers, and it remains to be seen whether an effect that works perfectly well in anime settles down over the course of the movie or just gives everyone watching a headache.Another Cameron cast-off of sorts is the so-far-untitled Terminator reboot that’s due to arrive naked and glistening around November time. Deadpool’s Tim Miller directs, with Linda Hamilton returning as Sarah Connor for the first time in close to three decades. This alone should be worth the price of admission, providing the powers that be can avoid any madcap Terminator Genisys-style last-minute plot twists. If Hamilton’s voice suddenly seems to take on a slight Austrian accent, or her eyes begin glowing all red and shiny, we’ll know we’re in trouble.Do audiences really want to see a Men in Black movie without Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones? We’ll find out in June when Thor: Ragnarok pals Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson pull on the sharp suits and make with the forget-everything gizmos in the latest instalment of the zany alien saga. Meanwhile, Smith has jumped ship to October’s Gemini Man, which has the inimitable Ang Lee in charge – though don’t forget that the Taiwanese … ahem … director of The Hulk boasts somewhat average form when it comes to genre fare. Given this one is about an ageing assassin who comes up against a younger version of himself, the one-time Hollywood top dog’s aides will presumably be hoping against hope that nobody remembers Looper.Finally, December sees the final instalment in the new Star Wars trilogy hit cinemas. Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker returns (again) after copping it last time (presumably as some kind of Force ghost), while we’ll get to see if Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren can recover from his ignominious failure to spot Skywalker’s cheap conjuring trick at the Battle of Crait. Does anyone care who Rey’s parents are any more?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d7a8b8af28281c6008776a0db90ce2dd14e3d72/0_185_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0143850a64b190043ef3efb03daf436b","title":"the film that reveals an island idylls traumatic secret","story":"The lives of refugees detained by the Australia government on remote Christmas Island are the focus of a powerful yet poetic new documentaryFive years ago, Gabrielle Brady, an Australian film-maker, decided to visit an old friend who had moved to remote Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean. The tiny tropical Australian territory was only settled a century ago, when phosphate, deposited as guano by seabirds, was mined by Chinese and Malay labourers. Its latest industry, however, was the controversial “offshore processing” of refugees. For the past 17 years, asylum seekers reaching Australia’s shores by boat have been dispatched to island detention centres and detained there indefinitely.Brady’s arrival on holiday gave her friend, Poh Lin Lee, a break from her difficult job on Christmas Island, providing therapy for traumatised detainees. “We spent two weeks enjoying this beautiful environment – ing with dolphins, looking for whale sharks, going to really remote beaches,” remembers Brady, who now lives in Berlin. “At the end, Poh said: ‘I need to show you something.’” They slashed their way through dense jungle with machetes (“everywhere you go on Christmas Island, you need a machete”) to reach a lookout. Below spread the grey buildings of the huge camp for refugees. “It was just truly shocking,” says Brady. “I’d seen that image so many times in the Australian media, but I’d forgotten it existed.”This revelatory mix of horror and beauty – and Lee’s growing reservations about her job – drove Brady to return to the island five times over the next four years, making her powerful, discombobulating debut feature, Island of the Hungry Ghosts. Instead of a familiar focus on the life stories of traumatised refugees, Brady’s film is a lyrical, dream-like journey into darkness. It offers no contextual information via voiceover or even captions instead, the camera lingers on brooding rainforest, the spooky dinosaur-like rattle of tropical birds, and the extraordinary migrating land crabs (whose respectful treatment by the island authorities contrasts with that of the human arrivals).The film’s core is Lee’s life and therapeutic work as one of four counsellors employed by Australia’s department of health at the island hospital. The film started small, she says, when she and Brady decided they wanted to secretly document detainees’ stories. Brady met them inside Lee’s consulting room, unbeknown to the guards posted outside the door, and gauged their willingness to be filmed. Although by agreeing they risked punishment or being transferred to other island camps, “there was huge interest,” says Brady. “I was meeting people who had been there for four or five years. There was a huge sense of desperation.”It was dangerous for Lee as well, with the Australian government having introduced a draconian law threatening whistleblowers with two years’ imprisonment. Lee took the chance. “It was far more important to document the stories at that stage,” she says, by phone from Nice, where she now lives with her French husband and two children. “The risk I faced was nowhere near what the asylum seekers risked.”In therapy with Lee, refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere discuss their treatment in detention, rather than the conflicts they have fled – a deliberate decision to avoid re-traumatising them. She worries about the impact on them of being constantly asked to retell their “trauma story”. “When I discussed these concerns with Gabrielle we realised it wasn’t the kind of storytelling we wanted to invite. We offered therapeutic work and if something came out that would contribute to the film, that was secondary.”In fact, Brady ended up filming more extensively only once some asylum seekers had been transferred to the Australian mainland. She and Lee felt their subjects could offer fully informed consent once they had access to legal advice, unmonitored emails and more personal freedom. These scenes, Brady insists, are not re-enactments but a continuation of Lee’s therapeutic work. “At times we were filming in retrospect but the moment itself, particularly the therapy sessions, are very genuine. I haven’t touched them as a director. It worked creatively and it was the only way to have done it with real permission,” she says.The film also follows Lee into intimate corners of her family life as she struggles with her participation in the system that is abusing them. Family camping trips in Christmas Island’s national park look idyllic but are suffused with foreboding. How did Lee experience life in such a strange place? “When we first went there, it was quite sparkly and enticing. I’ve never swam on coral reefs that are completely undamaged. As we were there longer and started to realise that none of the Chinese or Malay community would leave the village area after dark, then we understood more about the history. There was this new layer of heaviness. At the end, I had a sense that the island holds so many lost, wandering spirits.”The film’s digressions into island folklore frustrated one critic, who labelled it “an all-too-pretty but information-deficient documentary”. Audiences with no knowledge of the well-established cruelty of Australia’s refugee policy – condemned by the UN and Amnesty International but with widespread support in Australia, and maintained by all main political parties – will not learn many facts from the film.But Brady wanted not merely to show her audience the refugee story she wanted them to feel it. The film’s opacity and slow pace throw viewers into a state of uncertainty that mirrors – very mildly, of course – the plight of incarcerated refugees. “I wanted to dislocate the audience – you don’t know where you are until a certain point in the film,” she says. “Cinema is like a trip that you are taken on. I wanted it to be a sensorial experience. That’s what implants something inside you – not information and context.”It was hard to sell this vision. Brady worked for four years unpaid, living in a caravan in Berlin. “It was difficult to pitch the project avoiding this box that it would be a refugee film – an information-driven exposé. It was hard for people to grapple with.” Eventually, she found funding in Europe (and also produced a more informative short film for the ). “It’s no accident that we didn’t get funded by Australia for this film,” says Brady. “It’s a politically suffocated place at the moment. I don’t feel welcome. I don’t feel like I could create a film there.”The Christmas Island detention centre was quietly closed last October. Since filming, one refugee has published a book of poetry and others are training to be dentists and lawyers nevertheless, all but one of more than 20 detainees who appear in the film remain in limbo on temporary visas, unsure if they will be allowed a future in Australia. Brady made an Australian edit concealing their faces because she fears they could still be “persecuted” by authorities. Setting aside the abuse, both Brady and Lee view indefinite detention as a disastrous own-goal for Australia. “I was meeting people at the top of their game – incredibly smart, multilingual,” says Brady. “These would be the sorts of people you would want in your country.”Lee, who now works with refugees in European countries including Turkey and Greece, is sure the system worsens trauma. “People process and recover by re-engaging in life, relationships, hopes and dreams. When people arrived on Christmas Island, they had come from unspeakable horror, but they were alive and engaged. Had they been welcomed into a community and given opportunities to work, we wouldn’t see these intensive ongoing effects of trauma. We’re creating a whole community of people who will be dependent on mental health services for the rest of their lives.”• Island of the Hungry Ghosts is released on 11 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26c975e61ffee9d2ce951618a65ebf4dd8b568a1/0_0_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c0a89524e7b66aae677848ec1be1091","title":"leeks tomatoes cheese sauce recipe nick deverell smith","story":"A vegetarian comfort food that makes the most of in-season British leeksThis is a really simple and comforting dish to make when you have had a busy day at work and only have a few things in the fridge.

Here are the best wraps, salads, sushi and moreFrom Spam Appreciation Week in March to June’s National Fudge Day and Sourdough September, every day of the year seems to have an (often baffling) link to a foodstuff. On the  food desk, we take this with a pinch of salt – and not just on National Salt Awareness Week (from 29 February) – lest your year in recipes and food articles becomes subsumed by commercial partnerships.But Veganuary, the movement encouraging us to try cutting out animal protein and produce for the first month of the year (in the hope that we’ll keep it up), feels a bit less silly. If adopted by enough people, veganism presents a viable way to offset environmental damage. It hit the mainstream in 2018, with conscious cooks and eaters embracing meat, fish, dairy and egg alternatives – from jackfruit to pulses – in their thousands. The Vegan Society says the UK’s vegan contingent has grown fourfold in just four years, from 150,000 in 2014 to over 600,000 now, while last year Waitrose became the first supermarket to have a dedicated vegan section in 134 of its stores.Going vegan does, however, demand a level of organisation and planning – and Veganuary is no exception. Where can you buy cashew cheese? What are the non-vegan ingredients everyone forgets about? Who writes the best (and easiest) vegan recipes? And, if you aren’t cooking and need a speedy feed al desko, where can you find the best vegan lunch to go? To answer that last question, I ate a dozen lunches from outlets near the office, and here’s what I found …It may be hard to balls up a hummus wrap, but I do think this one is pretty good for the price – it hits the spot, ranking low on imagination, but higher on palatability. The vegan chilli is very good – in spite of my objection to the side-soup format (taking more than half the price of the full-size option from customers for what seems like less than half the volume), and despite my hankering for an unvegan dollop of sour cream on top of it.45Sushi has an unfair advantage over other lunch options: douse with enough soy sauce, wasabi and ginger, and it always tastes good. This is as true of the vegan stuff as it is of fish, so I enjoyed this spread of rice, seaweed, vegetable and tofu concoctions, in spite of the whole premise of “takeaway sushi” somehow seeming wrong (given it is traditionally defined by the care, attention and precision with which it is made).45A paltry boxful of autumn and winter hues, this is tasty, but not one for the hungry. It has four components, of which the kale and lentil salad is the high point. The curried squash is nice, the hummus fine (you can’t go wrong), but there are two dried-up falafel-brown orbs of vegetal dust. I’m generally very keen on Leon’s vegan offering, but this isn’t their strongest option.35Soft tacos need to be heated to stop them falling apart. These had a split second on the grill before being loaded with a dead weight of loveless roasted veg and guacamole, and seasoned with bitter disappointment (but no salt). At £6.30, this is at the dearer end of the spectrum, and that’s not including the (vegan) cereal bar I had to buy afterwards to cheer myself up.15A generous box of orzo in tomato sauce, peppered with tired roasted veg and some arbitrary spinach leaves. This comes with an abundance of very sweet dressing which imparts flavour to something that would otherwise be bland – but it’s far too sugary. I sense the boxed pasta salad might have had its time there’s something outdated about this – which perhaps says all you need to know about Eat, really.15So good. Leon manages to make its vegan boxes delicious and desirable in their own right – quite a feat. These beans, seasoned with hot smoked sweet paprika (the spice used in chorizo) have a “meatiness” and are served over brown rice for a result that is wholesome, filling and satisfying. For the price, you won’t find a better vegan feed.55A better Mexican than Benito’s Hat, ticking the vital boxes that lunch should tick: tasty, sustaining and affordable. The wheat tortilla is made of pumpkin, which, though doughy, has a little more chutzpah on the taste front than wheat wraps usually do. Filled with black bean paste, cumin roasted butternut squash, chipotle salsa, spinach and coriander, it tastes freshly made and has plenty of flavour. Might be interesting to try the filling with a corn tortilla, though, for something gluten-free as well as vegan.45Has the visual appeal of a molehill, but is better in the mouth. The red lentil hummus needs seasoning, but I like the fact that this is filling and has lots of different textures, colours and flavours to keep me interested. I’m disappointed by the packaging, which I’d expect to feel a little more sustainable.35I had to have some jackfruit at some point – it was the darling ingredient for vegans in 2018, and is said to be a plant-based answer to pulled pork. I thought this was delicious, but it needed the addition of zingy guacamole and crunchy coleslaw at the till – to accompany the sweetness of sweet potato mash and the spicy jackfruit curry. The ingredients are, however, largely cheap, so I would say this is £1 too expensive.45I like the M\u0026ampS two-for-£4 deal – a bargain. I’m less impressed by the packaging – which not only sounds my eco alarm bells, but makes the food look so much less appealing. The Thai flavours in the salad (ginger and soy) are quite simply delicious, while the “meh” Mexican rice (I have decided all Mexican lunches need to come with extra lime for some zing) at least offers up the bulk I need. I was surprised not more of M\u0026ampS’s options were vegan they could do with a couple more.45I’m a big fan of Gail’s and this feels fresh, hearty and good for me, with lashings of roasted cabbage and pecan pesto dressing. I think it’s a bit underseasoned and could do with a more generous dollop of the pesto, on which it relies for its character. Were it not a vegan number, they would probably have thrown some crumbled feta over, but given the plant-based straitjacket, they need to make up for the flavour deficit.45We eat with our eyes as well as our palates, and I find it difficult to see past this bowlful’s lack of visual appeal, with its limp assembly of veg and herbs – another example of plastic packaging really not helping the dish out. But it’s worth doffing our caps to Tesco for having a relatively extensive line of affordable vegan lunch options, created for them by Wicked Kitchen. My rainbow curry bowl is full of flavour, with curried lentils and chickpeas, (slightly soggy) onion bhajis, mango cubes and minty dressing – but I wouldn’t go so far as to say the simply roasted sweet potato is “tandoori style”.25"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856caffae64a106a11c51f035abd8b899222a4b6/204_157_1227_736/master/1227.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=366affd0f439233f7a36d4485f904f28","title":"all eyes on the premier league football weekly extra podcast","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson, and Lars Sivertsen discuss a six-goal thriller in Bournemouth, early-window transfer moves, the Solskjær train rolling on, unpunished horror tackles and talent drain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf6a79ea1ae226bc36f8d59d042859ce184eb5/175_176_1949_1169/master/1949.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c3789ce2c40075e18a5b7d69e6b074","title":"time to notice georginio wijnaldum the central figure in liverpool surge manchester city","story":"Jürgen Klopp’s men face Manchester City as unbeaten league leaders and no one has played more of a part in that than their Dutch midfielderIn every title-winning team there is a player whose crucial contribution is largely overlooked by the wider public. A subtle operator among the standout performers who generates few headlines and even fewer accolades. But the fans love him, as does the manager, because they know without him there would be no success, no glory, no shiny silver trophy in the middle of May.It is too early to decide who that figure is in Liverpool’s current side, mainly because it is too early to say for sure that Liverpool are going to win the title. But ahead of Thursday’s potentially pivotal game against Manchester City there is, it feels, a standout candidate. He has featured in all but one of the leaders’ league fixtures this season and been central, literally as well as figuratively, to everything that has gone right for Jürgen Klopp’s side. Yet praise has not come his way, certainly not compared to that which has been received by many others in red. He is the near-invisible man in English football’s most striking team right now and his name is Georginio Wijnaldum.Put simply, without Wijnaldum there would be no unbeaten run, no string of clean sheets and no stream of goals for the current pace-setters. He more than anyone has stitched together Liverpool’s excellent defence with their excellent attack and is a certainty to face City in the Merseyside club’s biggest game since May’s Champions League final. Klopp confirmed as much by substituting the Dutchman with 12 minutes of Saturday’s 5-1 victory over Arsenal remaining. It was a clear case of “rest up for Thursday, Gini” after yet another superb display from Liverpool’s No 5, and as he departed from the pitch there came a standing ovation from the home crowd, followed by a blast of the Wijnaldum song. They’ve been singing it for some time at Anfield.It has not been easy for Wijnaldum since he joined Liverpool from Newcastle for £25m in July 2016. Indeed, there was a level of scepticism to his very arrival given the player’s generally underwhelming displays for a Newcastle team that were relegated during his one season on Tyneside. He scored 11 goals in 38 league appearances, an average total for an international attacking midfielder, and particularly so given all of those goals came at home, with four arriving in one game – against Norwich.But that did not deter Klopp, primarily because he recognised there was more to Wijnaldum than meets the eye. “He can play a few positions and players that come through the Dutch system usually have a good tactical understanding,” he said upon acquiring the player, and increasingly the 28-year-old has vindicated his manager’s belief in what he can provide the team.Under Klopp, Wijnaldum has operated in both a two-man and three-man midfield, most often as a playmaker but also, on occasion, in a purely defensive role. The emphasis has shifted from scoring goals to providing and preventing them as required in a system underpinned by hard-running and aggressive counterpressing. It’s a lot to take in and, understandably, Wijnaldum initially struggled to adapt. But as his displays this season have shown, Klopp was right to believe that the man who captained PSV Eindhoven to the Ereisie title in 2015 had the required aggression, stamina, work-rate, discipline, assurance in possession and all-round football intelligence to do so.Wijnaldum has completed 90 minutes for Liverpool on 18 occasions this season, including five of their six Champions League games. The only league game he has not been involved in was the 3-1 victory over Burnley last month and that was as part of a host of changes made by Klopp in order to keep his key men as fresh as possible. Practically ever present, the Netherlands international is also Liverpool’s best midfield performer in a number of notable areas, including most completed passes (906) and most completed dribbles (12 out of 19), showing his ability to not only keep Liverpool’s attacking momentum’s ticking over but also drive it forward.“Gini can switch from one mindset to the other and that is pretty good for us,” said Klopp of the player in August before going onto describe him as “outstanding” in the win over Arsenal, Liverpool’s eighth in succession in all competitions. He certainly was and what makes Wijnaldum’s form throughout the season especially noteworthy is he came into it with his place in the side under threat following the summer arrivals of Naby Keïta and Fabinho. His game-time and influence on Liverpool was meant to reduce but instead it has grown to the point where he is the most reliable, consistent and versatile midfielder for the team leading the way.And now for City. Wijnaldum will almost certainly find himself operating in a three-man midfield and tasked with putting pressure on those in blue when they have the ball – specifically the two Silvas, David and Bernardo – and then, when possession is overturned, getting Liverpool’s front three on the front foot as quickly as possible. Disrupt, distribute, run and rotate instructions Wijnaldum has been following to a tee for some months now. About time more people noticed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e935c1353b42558b429efc80a1f4de6a1719ced6/0_159_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d02b28932f1aabce23ee53309163cac2","title":"experts urge egypt to rethink two is enough population strategy","story":"Medics say limiting families s not the answer for a country where a baby is born every 15 secondsIn the cramped office of New Cairo hospital’s family planning clinic, Safah Hosny sets a box overflowing with contraceptives next to the visitors’ ledger on a small desk.There are eight condoms for one Egyptian pound, about 4p, or ampoules of injectable birth control, for just under 9p. A contraceptive implant lasting three years costs 22p, while copper IEDs – the most popular form of birth control on offer according to Dr Hosny – cost 17p.The low prices, far less than in any Egyptian pharmacy, are due to subsidies provided by Egypt’s health ministry, as clinics like Dr Hosny’s are on the frontline of Egypt’s battle against an exploding birthrate. A government programme called “two is enough” has been launched to encourage people to limit family size. From this month, the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly recently announced, the government will cease to provide financial support to a family after their second child.The five-year, $19m (£15m) programme comprises a poster campaign as well as growing a network of mobile and fixed family planning clinics across Egypt. Posters covering the walls of Egypt’s metro show an Egyptian 50-pound note, worth about £2.20, torn into five. “Would you rather ide this into five, or into two?” it asks.But the price and availability of contraceptives at clinics like that in New Cairo hospital belie a wider issue: that Egypt has a long way to go in persuading its people.Hosny says the clinic is happy to serve unmarried women. “For unmarried women I suggest the pill or injections,” she says, pulling out a slide of contraceptive pills.Yet “two is enough” risks failing to target the things that could make a real difference when families, particularly those from Egypt’s working class, are deciding to have children. The campaign will increase sex education for some medical professionals, but will not begin a programme of sex education in schools, currently non-existent. It also ignores options for women with unwanted pregnancies, with abortion seen as a legal grey area in Egypt.“I think it has to be multi-disciplinary thing,” says Dr Hussein S Gohar, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Yosri Gohar hospital in Cairo. “You have to start in schools to educate young kids about sex education, contraception and the hazards for themselves, as well as the future of the population explosion. Then they have to target people about to get married, and married people. But if you’re going to make legislation punishing them for a third child, then you have to provide an exit route for them, by allowing medical termination or even abortion clinics.”The heart of the problem, according to Gohar, means thinking about what motivates people to have large families in Egypt. “You need to change the mentality of the people and how they see things rather than just telling them what to do,” he said. “You can’t just go to people once every few months and say the population is too large and there’s not enough water so you need to have a smaller family.”The Egyptian government’s best efforts may also fail to reach more conservative doctors in rural areas, who are more likely to convey the message to patients that every child is a blessing, or to limit information about contraception. “The fact is that in every country, the government can’t cover the entire spectrum,” says Dr Natalia Kanem, head of the UN Population Fund, which has partnered with Egyptian ministries for the “two is enough” campaign. “Private providers can misinform, or even perform so-called medical female genital mutilation. Our job is to flood real information here to counter the myths.”“When girls are left behind, half the population is left behind.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fce514f18cba9cd8ca73bbd35cca49d1c73f2c7/2_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de66c1640a9835e9cd5edbcf8b62e1ec","title":"louis ck kevin spacey out in wilderness keep them there","story":"Whatever happened to the wilderness?

Did it turn out to be a really inhospitable place or something?I think we all have to ask as the huge caravan of men returning from #MeToo exile threatens to overwhelm us. Over the past week, it has been difficult to turn on the internet without seeing reports detailing this alleged crimewave’s progress. “My life is over,” declaimed comedian Louis CK to … hang on, where are my reading glasses? … a sold-out audience in Long Island. He owns a multi-million dollar estate on nearby Shelter Island, so I guess it feels as wastelandy a spot as any to unleash a set shitting all over school shooting survivors and people asking to be referred to by pronouns of their choice. But we’ll come to the courage of this material shortly.For now, join the huddled masses, Mr CK! I’m afraid the marketplace of men returning from the wilderness is now so crowded that you have to do something really quite special to get people’s unided attention.Leave it to acting’s Kevin Spacey, then, who dropped a Christmas video that is a work of quite eye-popping WTF-ery. Even by Kevin’s own standards of scenery-chewing, this one’s a real masticator. Top line? He still seems to be in the dark as to how his plot has resolved. What can one say? Other than: I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie, mate, but it turns out it was you all along.As it goes, that isn’t the particular role in his canon on which Kevin overtly draws for this video. Instead, he gets himself up as House of Cards villain Frank Underwood, albeit a Frank Underwood standing behind a kitchen counter in a Father Christmas apron.Other details? You can see why Kevin opted to stand next to a massive turkey – a massive ham would have been too self-parodic – but it does all fade into the background once he starts speaking. “I know what you want,” he begins boldly. “Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, too powerful … I shocked you with my honesty … but mostly I challenged you and made you think … So we’re not done, no matter what anyone says. I know what you want. You want me back …” On and on he rambles. “Soon enough, you will know the whole truth … Now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die, did you?”I’m watching it right now, Kevin.As for as the secondary import of Spacey’s message, I would say it is the most perfect representation I have ever seen of the space beyond CAA representation. Ditched by the agency last year, Kevin is now operating in a place so far from talent management that the Chinese are decades off being able to land a probe on it.Yet he is still given to reticence when it suits. Spacey is due to appear in court in Massachusetts next week, charged with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man in a bar in 2016. But a few days after the video dropped, his lawyer argued that Spacey appearing in person would only “amplify the negative publicity already generated in connection with this case”. Though the judge didn’t actually use the words “I think your client’s kitchen psycho video already did that”, he did throw the request out, so perhaps the Santa apron will get a more formal outing next Tuesday.However he plays it, then, Spacey’s performance is already a real credit to his most recent alma mater, the Meadows clinic in Arizona, where you may recall his fellow patients included Harvey Weinstein. The Meadows offers a $2,000-a-night wilderness-type experience, being in the actual wilderness, but without requiring the sacrifice of comforts such as a kale menu or steam room.Both Harvey and Kevin are now back home, so both are … cured, is it? … of the illness they were being treated for. Well done, the Meadows! I hope this clinical success has spurred the creation of a dedicated programme for guys wrongly accused of multiple sexual assaults. I know the very last thing you care about is money, but it doesn’t hurt that this is easily the fastest-growing entertainer demographic. Furthermore, I hope all your other paying patients who had to sit in group-therapy sessions with these two realise how lucky they were to share a treatment journey with some of the earliest identified sufferers of this illness – so new it has yet to be given a name. Does it even have a working title, or are you still listing it as Untitled Sexual Abuse Addiction Project?And so to Louis CK, whose bootlegged set suggested he is so angry at what he did to his life that he can only express it as anger toward people who wish to be known by different pronouns. I expect the next stage of his journey will be sophisticatedly demanding why something is transgressive when he says it, but not when it is said by, say, one of the women he forced to watch him masturbate in a locked room.I’m sure we hate to disappoint this self-styled groundbreaker, but this is all very old hat. Jim Davidson was crusading against comic injustice way back in the 1980s. “‘Well, Billy Connolly swears,’” he recently recalled saying to his BBC bosses. “The producers at the BBC said: ‘A Billy Connolly swear word is different to a Jim Davidson swear word,’ so there you go. Maybe it’s the Scottish accent.” Yes. Well, I’m sure if it was going to be the fault of anything, it would be that Billy came from a different country from Jim. Still, they gave him a very good living for a couple of decades. And Jim’s failure to accept that his time had passed gave him the next two decades of material.Listening to Louis CK’s set, I was struck how much he reminded me of post-BBC Davidson, a man whose act strayed into such unfunny shithousery that it frequently drew complaints even from audience members who’d paid to see a Jim Davidson gig. And so with Louis CK. Not laughing is presented as an imaginative failure on the audience’s part. It reminds us that there is a special, roped-off VIP area of Woke for guys who have been accused of sexual misconduct. They can see worlds you can’t! They are here to reveal their mysteries to you! THEY ARE STILL YOUR SPIRIT ANIMAL, OK? Catch up.As far as much of the rest of the act goes – pronouns, black guys having big dicks – this stuff really is the equivalent of mother-in-law material. It is one of the more embarrassing ironies of the age that everyone who utters the phrase “But you can’t say that any more” has, quite literally, just said the thing you can’t say.One of my biggest and most doomed wishes for 2019 is for comedians to stop acting like it’s crusadingly dangerous to say things that are basically indistinguishable from Jim Davidson’s 1977 Seaside Special act – and then not just wondering why they don’t get campus bookings, but claiming that comedy is being “killed”.Comedy is not being killed. You can still say the things you can’t say. It is 41 years since Allan Bloom wrote his pearl-clutching book The Closing of the American Mind: How Higher Education Has Failed Democracy and Impoverished the Souls of Today’s Students. It is 37 years since New York magazine ran its landmark article suggesting that the thought police were recreating 1930s Germany.Since then, what has really changed? Students are still being mild idiots on campus, but it was ever thus. We’ve known students are idiots since way back. Shakespeare even wrote one of his top four tragedies about it. But you know, unless they homicidally avenge their fathers, sparking a chain of events that basically wipes out a generation of Denmark’s ruling family, they usually get over it.I wish rich comedians would. Apart from students, who surely can’t believe the attention they’re paid, the only other people wetting their pants about all this bollocks are rightwingers who profit financially or electorally from making it a bogeyman. Look at the results. People who can see it works have been banging this drum for almost four decades now, and – SPOILERS – they keep winning. Four decades of seeing snowflakes everywhere has not closed the American mind. TURN ON THE TELLY. The American mind remains so yawningly, chasmically open that it has literally elected Donald Trump as its president. I don’t want to close the American mind after the horse has been made consul but CHRIST, can we try some new material, please?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e55712c45134fd45b17d6be8dcce167c878ad833/0_0_4466_2681/master/4466.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42e5a2b47823b23bde24b98e39b76887","title":"culture fascination with the dark side of the moon","story":"From Pink Floyd’s mental hell to the secret lair of space Nazis, artists have striven unceasingly to sketch the side of the moon China’s Chang’e 4 just reached ‘I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon.” These could easily have been the words of the Chinese team behind Chang’e 4, shortly before it set off on its successful journey to the moon’s far side. But as any rock fan will tell you, they were immortalised 45 years ago at the end of Pink Floyd’s track Brain Damage. It was the line that gave their most famous album, The Dark Side of the Moon, its title. And it remains one of the most enduring phrases in popular culture – copied, spoofed and riffed on by generations to come (even Krusty the Clown has a “lost” album entitled Dark Side of the Moonpie).It’s not hard to see why artists have a fascination with the moon’s far side. It speaks of the unknowable, the distant and the elusive – and is especially ripe for metaphor. For Pink Floyd, the moon’s dark side was used to symbolise the darker forces of human nature on an album that delved into unusual territories for pop: mental illness, mortality and the scars of the second world war. As songwriter Roger Waters explained in the 1994 book Bricks in the Wall: “The line ‘I’ll see you on the dark side of the moon’ is me speaking to the listener, saying, ‘I know you have these bad feelings and impulses because I do too, and one of the ways I can make direct contact with you is to share with you the fact that I feel bad sometimes.’”Other songwriters have seen the moon’s most distant territory differently. For English folk singer Vin Garbutt, it helped describe the conditions of the 1982 Falklands war, where soldiers died in such cold and bloodied conditions it “may as well have been the dark side of the moon”. Rapper Lil Wayne’s 2018 duet with Nicki Minaj envisaged it more romantically, as a place of escape from a postapocalyptic Earth: he arranged to meet up with Minaj on the dark side of the moon, asking her to “leave a message in the dust just for me” when she reached the safe haven. Given that he also offered to take her for a walk once she got there “as she wears slippers”, you suspect their lovestruck escape mission might ultimately have been doomed by insufficient technical preparation.Outside music, the sheer remoteness of the moon’s furthest side has been seized on as a plot device. In the film Iron Sky, the defeated Nazis fled to the moon after the second world war to rebuild their forces – with the plan to ultimately conquer Earth using a space fleet. A crowdfunded sequel is due to be released this month. In Jed Mercurio’s 2007 novel Ascent, a Soviet astronaut successfully lands on the far side of the moon during a secret mission, only to be abandoned there alone when his craft breaks down and the USSR denies any such attempt took place.But for many people, the moon’s dark side will only ever be associated with Pink Floyd. On 4 January, the UK’s National Space Centre in Leicester is putting on the first of two sold-out light and laser shows in its Sir Patrick Moore Planetarium, combining the band’s music with the story of the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, which orbited the moon and made the crew the first humans to see the moon’s other side.“While Pink Floyd titled The Dark Side of the Moon, as an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy, the links between the band and the Apollo space programme can be seen in their work,” says Josh Barker, the space centre’s planetarium coordinator and education presenter. “Pink Floyd played a major part in the heady days of the 1960s and 70s, creating innovative sounds that captured the feelings of optimism and freedom that set out the era as something really very special.”The timing of the shows with the Chang’e 4 landing may be coincidental, but nevertheless they neatly summarise the way the moon’s furthest reaches have fascinated scientists and artists alike.Bringing things back down to Earth for a moment, it’s safe to say that the Chang’e 4 team probably didn’t mention Pink Floyd’s song at the start of their mission – not because they’re all secretly bigger fans of King Crimson, but because the statement would be scientifically incorrect. It is not the moon’s “dark” side that Chang’e 4 landed on, but its far side – and that’s an important distinction. Each side of the moon is blessed with a roughly equal amount of the sun’s light it’s just that humans only get to see one side of it. Of course, Pink Floyd acknowledged that too. Listen carefully as the album’s climax fades to leave a thudding heartbeat and you’ll hear Gerry O’Driscoll, the doorman to Abbey Road studios where it was recorded, saying: “There is no dark side of the moon really. Matter of fact, it’s all dark.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a840ed5d317f576dfbcd3d45aa52760354980bda/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=294dc0f38ce765b2ef5aaaae1d8ea0f8","title":"nirvana sue designer marc jacobs over alleged copyright breach","story":"Representatives of the band are suing the brand over a logo in its Redux Grunge collectionNirvana are suing designer Marc Jacobs for copyright infringement. The brand’s recent Redux Grunge collection features several items that resemble the Seattle grunge band’s black-and-yellow iconography, Forbes reports.Representatives for the group, which split in 1994 following the death of frontman Kurt Cobain, claim that Marc Jacobs’ unauthorised use of “Nirvana’s copyrighted image on and to promote its products is intentional”. The suit claims that the use of Nirvana’s iconography, which the group has used since 1992, is to “make the ‘Grunge’ association with the collection more authentic”. has contacted representatives for Nirvana and Marc Jacobs.The suit also cites the use of Nirvana references in Marc Jacobs marketing materials, including a meme posted to the brand’s Tumblr account featuring a clip of the group’s 1991 hit, Smells Like Teen Spirit, and an image of Jacobs wearing a T-shirt above the words Come As You Are, the title of a 1992 hit by the trio.The suit describes Marc Jacobs’ actions as “oppressive, fraudulent and malicious” and claims that they “have caused Nirvana to suffer irreparable injuries” and “threaten to dilute the value of Nirvana’s licenses with its licensees for clothing products”.The department stores Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus are also included in the suit for selling the items that allegedly infringe the band’s copyright. The group is seeking monetary damages, the removal of sale of any such items and the removal of Nirvana references from promotional materials.Nirvana’s iconography is subject to regular bootlegging: the hoodies found on market stalls worldwide are seldom licensed items. The group would be unlikely to pursue these vendors because of the low possibility of recovering significant damages, says Alexander Ross, a partner at music lawyers Wiggins LLP.“Suing a major brand for alleged infringement, however, makes more sense from a financial perspective, and for PR and scale purposes, assuming of course that the action is successful,” says Ross. “It also sends a message to other players in the fashion industry that the IP in question is jealously guarded against infringement.”In 1992, at the height of Nirvana’s fame, Marc Jacobs was fired from designer Perry Ellis after showing his infamous grunge collection, which mixed plaid, silk and skull caps. “Grunge is anathema to fashion,” said American fashion critic Cathy Horyn. Jacobs started his own line a year later, launching his debut collection in 1994.The Nirvana suit is the latest controversy to hit the designer. “The label is turning out clothes and accessories that lack a compelling point of view, failing to generate the excitement created by younger peers Alexander Wang and Joseph Altuzarra,” New York Times reporter Steven Kurutz wrote in June. Kurutz cited luxury goods research by Exane BNP Paribas that estimated the brand had been losing more than £45m annually over the past few years.By contrast, the value of band merchandise continues to grow, becoming increasingly important to artists’ revenue streams following the decline of physical media and the impact of streaming on the market.Partnerships between bands and fashion houses have proven lucrative, such as Canadian rapper Drake’s collaboration with winter wear brand Canada Goose. Official artist merchandise can attain the status of high fashion, a charge led by the designs produced for Kanye West’s tour in support of his 2013 album Yeezus.The market for vintage band T-shirts is also booming. In 2011, an anonymous Australian buyer spent $10,000 on a Led Zeppelin T-shirt from the group’s 1979 gig at Knebworth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22b2808c2c88b1b78a6aaba538108350bc7fbfed/488_29_1772_1063/master/1772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6cfa9f09d1f978cbe724684fc5f6f4c","title":"why exercise alone wont save us","story":"Sedentary lifestyles are killing us – we need to build activity into our everyday lives, not just leave it for the gym. By  Vybarr Cregan-ReidThis is the time of year when trainers are mined from under beds and gym kits are disinterred from the bottom drawer. Google searches relating to physical fitness peak in January. Many people even trawl the web to find out about “desk exercises” and “workouts on the go” in case they are too busy to use their new gym memberships.Our relationship with exercise is complicated. Reports from the UK and the US show it is something we persistently struggle with. As the new year rolls around, we anticipate having the drive to behave differently and become regular exercisers, even in the knowledge that we will probably fail to do so. Why do we want to exercise? What do we expect it to do for us? We all know we are supposed to be exercising, but hundreds of millions of us can’t face actually doing it. It is just possible the problem lies at the heart of the idea of exercise itself.Exercise is movement of the muscles and limbs for a specific outcome, usually to enhance physical fitness. As such, for most of us, it is an optional addition to the working day – yet another item on a long list of responsibilities alongside the fulfilment of parental duties or earning money to put food on the table. But because the principal beneficiary of exercise is ourselves, it is one of the easiest chores to shirk. At the end of the working day, millions of us prefer to indulge in sedentary leisure activities instead of what we all think is good for us: a workout. Fitness crazes are like diets: if any of them worked, there wouldn’t be so many. CrossFit, the intensely physical, communal workout incorporating free weights, squats, pull-ups and so forth, is still less than 20 years old. Spin classes – vigorous group workouts on stationary bikes – have only been around for about 30. Aerobics was a craze about a decade before that, although many of its high-energy routines had already been around for a while. (The pastel horror of 1970s Jazzercise is probably best forgotten.) Before that, there was the jogging revolution, which began in the US in the early 1960s. The Joggers Manual, published in 1963 by the Oregon Heart Foundation, was a leaflet of about 200 words that sought to address the postwar panic about sedentary lifestyles by encouraging an accessible form of physical activity, explaining that “jogging is a bit more than a walk”. The jogging boom took a few years to get traction, hitting its stride in the mid- to late-80s, but it remains one of the most popular forms of exercise, now also in groups.The exercise craze that dominated the 1950s was, oddly, not even an exercise. The vibrating exercise belt promised users could achieve effortless weight loss by having their midriffs violently jiggled. It didn’t work, but you can still find similar machines available for purchase today.These fads even came with their own particular fashions – legwarmers, leotards, Lycra. So is our obsession with fitness doomed to be the stuff of embarrassing passing “phases”? Is exercise itself a fad?It is not news that we are becoming more sedentary as a species. The problem has been creeping up on us for generations. As industry and technology solved the physical demands of manual labour, they created new challenges for the human body.Evidence about bone strength and density gleaned from fossils of early humans suggests that, for hundreds of thousands of years, normal levels of movement were much higher than ours today. And the range of work required of the human body to subsist was sizeable: everything from foraging for food and finding water to hunting, constructing basic shelters, manufacturing tools and evading predators. The fossil record tells us that many prehistoric humans were stronger and fitter than today’s Olympians.A hundred years ago, while life was easier than it had been for our hunter-gatherer forebears, it was still required that shopping was fetched, floors scrubbed, wood chopped and washing done by hand. Modern urban environments do not invite anything like the same kinds of work from the body. It is not easy to clock up those miles when cities are built to prioritise cars and treat pedestrians as secondary. We are not assisted by our environments to move like we used to, for reasons tied up with motivation, safety and accessibility.Technological innovations have led to countless minor reductions of movement. To clean a rug in the 1940s, most people took it into their yard and whacked the bejeezus out of it for 20 minutes. Fast-forward a few decades and we can set robot vacuum cleaners to wander about our living rooms as we order up some shopping to be delivered, put on the dishwasher, cram a load into the washer-dryer, admire the self-cleaning oven, stack some machine-cut logs in the grate, pour a glass of milk from the frost-free fridge or thumb a capsule into the coffee maker. Each of these devices and behaviours is making it a bit more difficult for us to keep moving regularly throughout our day.As we step through various innovations, we tend to think of the work that is no longer required as “saved”. Cleaning a rug once burned about 200 calories, while activating a robo-vac uses about 0.2 – an activity drop of a thousandfold, with nothing to replace it. Nobody, when they buy a labour-saving device, thinks: “How am I going to replace that movement I have saved?”As a result of our leisurely lifestyles, our bones are thinner and our muscles weaker, and while these are not problems in themselves, they are part of the larger, fleshier story whereby the diminution of movement is shackling humans to the very biggest global killers. Heart disease and strokes are responsible for about 17 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.All-day activity trackers like the Apple Watch and the Fitbit (which is only a decade old this year) have attempted to make an intervention into this sandpit of sedentariness. Widespread use of wearables may be helping people to move more, but technology created this problem of sedentary work and leisure, and cannot solve it alone.Exercise, in these terms, is not a fad, or an option, or an add-on to our busy lifestyles: it is keeping us alive. But before it can work for us, our whole approach needs to change.As a result of the Miracle Cure report, doctors were urged to promote regular exercise among their patients. Humans obviously need regular activity, but the modern world strives to take exertion out of our lives. Modernity is characterised by imperatives to simplify, improve and maximise efficiency. In much the same way, medical bodies trying to motivate the population to exercise promise big results with the absolute minimum of disruption to our busy, seated lives.Anyone researching exercise strategies this new year will find that the government recommends “at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity such as cycling or brisk walking every week and strength exercises on 2 or more days a week that work all the major muscles (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)”.If 150 minutes – or half an hour five times a week – is too much for you, and the data suggests that for most of us it is, another public health strategy promotes the efficacy of being active for just 10 minutes a day. Public Health England launched its Active10 campaign on the grounds that just 10 minutes’ brisk walking each day “counts as exercise” and “can reduce your risk of serious illnesses like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers”.Even less time is required for high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which can involve bouts of just 20 seconds of intense effort a few times a week. It seems there is good evidence for the efficacy of very short bursts of strenuous anaerobic exercise, such as sprinting or cycling hard, followed by a brief recovery period. Interval training may improve insulin sensitivity and oxygen circulation, and increase muscle mass. But one of the early researchers into HIIT, kinesiologist Dr Martin Gibala, worried that despite its benefits, it required “an extremely high level of subject motivation”, because all-out exertion is unpleasant and can lead to dizziness, vomiting or injury. “Given the extreme nature of the exercise,” he wrote, “it is doubtful that the general population could safely or practically adopt the model.”While all of these three modes of exercise are effective in different ways, and each has its proponents and committed followers, none is an all-round solution for a “fit” human body. But the problem is not really with the exercises themselves it is what we tend to do in between those bursts of activity.The health effects of being sedentary are as common and recognisable as they are serious. Anxiety, depression, heart disease, breast and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and the leading cause of global disability, back pain, are all driven by sedentary behaviours.For our bodies to function properly, they operate on the assumption that we will be burning calories throughout the day, and not in short bursts. It is clear that periods of sedentariness are bad for the human body, and some exercise is always going to be better than none the issue is not really to do with the types of exercise, but with our approach to them and what we expect them to achieve. We know from the data that the human relationship with exercise is predominantly characterised as both optional and additional to an otherwise sedentary life, which itself causes a ton of problems. As long as physical activity is orced from the real work of our lives, we will find reasons for not doing it.The rise of exercise is synonymous with the rise of leisure. We associate this with the start of the Industrial Revolution, but in fact it dates from much earlier. Once humans settled and began to build, several thousand years ago, hierarchies began to form, particularly in cities, as did the gap between master and servant. To be one of the elite meant others were doing the physical work for you. For the masters, there was time to fill, and into this space grew the idea of leisure. Exercise also emerges here, in the imbalance created in the spread of labour performed across a population. Ever since, we have seen a powerful link between exercise and inequality.The wealthy men of ancient Greece, deprived of work by their slaves and with little else to do, invented a new place called the gymnasium, an open space in the city where they could strip off and gambol about naked, competing in made-up challenges to keep each other fit for war.Later, the Romans also celebrated the value of exercise. Cicero, the Roman politician and lawyer, said: “It is exercise alone that supports the spirits and keeps the mind in vigour.” Pliny the Younger, a writer and also a lawyer, said: “It is remarkable how one’s wits are sharpened by physical exercise.” Like their Greek gym buddies, these men were privileged and wealthy. They understood that even though the slave class did their work for them, exercise and physical activity were essential for a long and sane life.After the Greeks and Romans, exercise all but disappeared from western culture. It didn’t resurface properly until the 18th century, when inactivity became a problem for a certain class of gentleman. In 1797, the Monthly Magazine announced a new patent for Francis Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, the earliest of the static exercise machines – a frame in which the user sat, turning a spindle with his arms and operating a treadle with his feet. The article noted that “when peculiar or sedentary occupations enforce confinement to the house, it promises to be equally useful to the healthy as to the sick. The merchant, without withdrawing his attention from his accounts, and the student, while occupied in writing or reading, may have his lower limbs kept in constant motion by the slightest exertion, or, the assistance of a child.” The handle on the contraption’s lower spindle was arranged so that, if desired, a child could be employed to turn the wheel, to save the user valuable energy.In the early 20th century, calisthenics became popular among people with limited means of expending physical energy. In the opening pages of EM Forster’s Howards End, from 1910, we are introduced to the Wilcox family as they come and go in their country-house garden. They are “new money” they see the world instrumentally, and are mostly allergic to it, too. A visitor reports the scene in a letter: “Then Evie comes out, and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage tree – they put everything to use – and then she says ‘a-tissue,’ and in she goes.” Like inactivity, hay fever only seemed to afflict those higher up the social scale.In 1831 the Journal of Health defined calisthenics as “a reasonable, methodical, and regular employment of the exercises best calculated to develop the physical powers of young girls, without detriment to the perfecting of the moral faculties”. Its adoption was necessary because “young girls have not the same freedom as boys in their outdoor exercise, and their customary amusements and occupations, when not at school, are of a more sedentary nature”.Since our modern way of life denies many of us the physical exertion that kept our ancestors healthy, one way to gain social capital is to add it back in.Any kind of communal exercise gives us a sense of belonging, of shared values and endeavours, aside even from its more general physical and mental benefits. When people gather together in a gym or in an exercise class, at least one aspect of what they are doing is joining together in a civic activity that ensures their collective survival, just like the ancient Greeks before them.If being fit promotes long life, you might expect being an elite athlete to help you reach a ripe old age. It doesn’t. Olympians buy themselves an extra 2.8 years on average, according to a 2012 study. Devoting your life to sport and exercise will buy you more time, but once you factor in the Olympians’ lifelong sustained attention to diet and healthy living, as well as tens of thousands of hours spent training, 2.8 years might not really seem sufficient recompense.Instead, the fittest and healthiest people on the planet have never been to a gym. These people, who report high levels of wellbeing and live extraordinarily long lives, inhabit what have been called “blue zones” – areas where lifestyles lead to peculiar longevity. The term was coined by two demographers, Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain, who, while collecting data on clusters of centenarians on the island of Sardinia, identified places of especially high longevity on their map with a blue felt-tip pen. Because clusters of long-lived people are often found in geographically remote places (also including parts of Okinawa, Costa Rica and Greece), jackpot genes seem like a strong candidate to explain their longevity. But a famous study of Danish twins has concluded that a long life seems to be only “moderately heritable”. Over the years, many studies have looked at the lifestyles of people in “blue zones” and found that a number of their customs and habits contribute to a long life (everything from a sense of belonging and purpose to not smoking, or eating a predominantly plant-based diet). In the list of contributory factors, there is a noticeable absence of exercise.In my conversation with Pes, he repeatedly stressed that while diet and environment are important components of longevity, being sedentary is the enemy, and sustained, low-level activity is the key that research by him and others has uncovered: not the intense kinds of activity we tend to associate with exercise, but energy expended throughout the day. The supercentenarians he has worked with all walked several miles each day throughout their working lives. They never spent much time, if any, seated at desks.Pes has recently been studying workers in one of the island’s regions of longevity, Seulo (population around 1,000). He discovered one group of women who had spent their working lives seated, but nonetheless reached a great age. They had been working treadles (pedal-powered sewing machines), which meant they had regularly burned sufficient calories to derive the longevity benefits of remaining active. (Lowndes’ Gymnasticon, which works like a treadle, is starting to look a little less ridiculous as a solution for sedentary workers.)For all the trillions invested in healthcare year on year, there are regions in high-income nations (such as the UK and the US) where life expectancy is still as low as it was in the mid-60s. In Tower Hamlets, one of the poorer parts of London, men can only expect an average of 61 years of good health – and women just 56.So far, researchers agree that sustained periods of low-level activity seem to work well. Aiming for 10,000 steps a day is a good idea, but 15,000 better resembles the distances likely covered by our prehistoric ancestors, and indeed by those Sardinian centenarians.For those of us who can’t move to Sardinia and become a shepherd, a review published in the Lancet in 2016 found that “high levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (ie, about 60-75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time”.So even if we go to the gym on a Saturday morning, our absolute inactivity at other times can still be damaging to the body. Low and moderate activity for longer or sustained periods seems to produce the best results. It looks like excessive high-intensity activity (the kind we see in elite athletes) drives metabolism and cell turnover, and may even, when all factors are taken into account, accelerate the ageing process.As those all-day activity trackers continue to mature into their second decade, they will no doubt find better ways of encouraging us out of our chairs. At the moment, though, they can only count the things we have done, not the opportunities for movement we have missed. They make us more likely to be attentive to our activity than our inactivity.After two centuries of trying, we should accept that exercise is not working as a global fitness strategy while it remains an addition to the working day. In the long view, it is starting to look a lot like a fad. Government guidelines in the UK and other countries that encourage sport and exercise are failing. These strategies struggle because we are trying to get people to give up what little leisure time they have to pursue activities that require substantial additional effort.Perhaps instead we should encourage people to make the kinds of daily decisions that result in a healthier life. What is needed are the kinds of strategies that would make exercise unnecessary. Urban planning that better addresses the outdoor experience and encourages movement would be a key part of this change. But on an inidual level, we can think about returning a little of the friction that technology has so subtly smoothed out for us, and make it easy to get things done. Exercise becomes physical activity when it is part of your daily life.A year ago, my car lease came up for renewal. I had been a driver for nearly 30 years, but after all the alarming research I had read about the impact of modern lifestyles, I could not possibly keep it. I now walk miles more than I used to. Without a car, getting to the gym involved a 70-minute round trip. By the time I had walked there and back, the workouts seemed less necessary, so I cancelled my membership.I tried other things, too. I experimented with a standing desk, but I knew from Pes’s research in Sardinia that it is not sitting itself that is bad, but the inactivity associated with it. Standing in one place for hours is only marginally better than sitting there. The Gymnasticon is also making a comeback. Its new incarnation is the treadmill desk, which seeks to keep office workers permanently on the move. From a health perspective it seems superb, but it is hardly practical. Getting a less comfortable office chair would probably be as effective a strategy, making it less easy to settle into for long periods of immobility.You don’t have to join a gym this year. The numbers tell us that exercise is not the solution to the problems associated with physical inactivity, for the simple reason that these two things are not opposites. The antidote is activity: to find and recover some of the movement that modern life has been taking from us for centuries.Vybarr Cregan-Reid is the author of Primate Change: How the World We Made Is Changing Us, which is available to buy at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0f0f60d130e8c0762d1e7f774567f040f0f01c/0_142_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ee9495722e3f0329c8970ccd0153d6","title":"brexit freight ferry firm appears all geared up to deliver pizzas","story":"Terms and conditions on Seaborne website seem to be intended for food companyFirst, it emerged that the “startup” company hired to operate extra ferries as part of no-deal Brexit planning had no ships.Now, new questions are being asked about the readiness of Seaborne Freight to handle the £13.8m contract after it turned out that terms and conditions on its website appeared to be intended for a food delivery firm.“It is the responsibility of the customer to thoroughly check the supplied goods before agreeing to pay for any mealorder,” read part of the text on the company’s website.Another section, which appeared to be constructed with a view more to mitigating against the impact of prank pizza orders than transporting goods across some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, warned: “Users are prohibited from making false orders through our website.”It added: “Seaborne Freight (UK) Limited reserves the right to seek compensation through legal action for any losses incurred as the result of hoax delivery requests and will prosecute to the full extent of the law.” Chris Grayling’s Department for Transport said a section of the terms and conditions on the company’s website had been put up in error and was being immediately rectified.Among those criticising the company after the curious language on the terms and conditions was first pointed out by Twitter users was Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, who said: “Seaborne Freight. No ships, no trading history and website T\u0026ampCs copied and pasted from a takeaway delivery site.”Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said: “Awarding a contract to a ferry company with no ships is yet another disgraceful misuse of public money by the transport secretary.“The idea that Chris Grayling is backing a new business and has looked at this ‘very carefully’ is utterly risible. It’s yet another example of his incompetence and mismanagement of the UK’s transport system.” Another Labour MP, Tonia Antoniazzi, said: “This is beyond a joke. It’s not just that the government have panic-hired a firm with no ships to conduct ferry services. That firm has literally nothing prepared to suggest the £13.8m handed over to them is a sound investment. They’ve seemingly copied and pasted their terms off a takeaway fast food website, and their login portal sends you back to Google.”Other signs that the website may have been cobbled together included a “portal login” section that was an image of username and password boxes rather than an actual means of logging in. A language settings option also appeared to be an image of a union flag rather than an interactive option.Grayling, the transport secretary, was forced to defend the contract on Wednesday when he said he would “make no apologies for supporting a new British business” after widespread criticism.The contract is one of three agreements worth a total of £107.7m signed by the government to help ease congestion at Dover by securing extra lorry capacity in the event of a no-deal Brexit.There was also pressure on the government to guarantee that the new ferry services aimed at easing pressure on Dover would be crewed by British seafarers.Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, wrote to Grayling to seek assurances that any ships would be fully crewed by UK workers and to stress that collective bargaining agreements should be in place.Sandra Welch, the deputy chief executive of the Sailors’ Society charity, expressed concerns about safety. “Safety is paramount,” she said. “And to avoid tragedy it is crucial that the right people with the necessary skills are involved.”Seaborne hopes to operate freight ferries from Ramsgate from late March, beginning with two ships and increasing to four by the end of the summer.A spokesperson at Grayling’s department said on Thursday: “Before any contract was signed, due diligence on Seaborne Freight was carried out both by senior officials at the Department for Transport, and highly reputable independent third-party organisations with significant experience and expertise into Seaborne’s financial, technical and legal underpinning.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64e4e79ceed9e7da39e57b98589fb46ab5073b2/0_169_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c5839d7506d8a8035cd5626c51d6a03","title":"age against the machine secret enjoying long life carl honore","story":"The writer Carl Honoré used to think of ageing as a ‘chamber of horrors’. Now he argues we are in a ‘golden age’ for older peopleRead inspiring stories of four of Carl Honoré’s ‘ageing heroes’Three years ago, Carl Honoré, the journalist whose series of books, starting with In Praise of Slow in 2004, has made him the guru of slow living, had an epiphany. Like a true Canadian, though one born in Scotland and domiciled in London, he adores ice hockey, and still plays hard and fast at the age of 51. But one day, at a tournament in Gateshead, someone pointed out that he was the oldest player among the 240 competitors. “I knew that I was one of the oldest, but being told in such raw terms that I was the oldest – it just shook me. It knocked me for six in a way that shocked me.”Honoré was 48 at the time, “the big 50” was looming, and what he calls “the terrible weight of the number” started dragging him down. Was ageing really going to be as bad as everyone said? Was all he had to look forward to now decline, decrepitude and death? On the train back to London, as his team-mates knocked back the beers, he decided to embark on a book on the subject.“I’ve found with all my books that they start with what is almost an out-of-body experience when I see myself in sharp relief from the side,” he tells me. “I needed to understand my own relationship with the number, with what ageing means, and where I was going to be in 10 or 20 years.” The result is B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives – a call for society to become less ageist and for iniduals to stop worrying about the process of ageing and wring every drop out of whatever time is allotted to us.Honoré has travelled the world in search of active, high-achieving older people, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to hold the “outliers” up as the norm. He is more interested in a state of mind in which the average 70- and 80-year-old goes on working if they want to, volunteering, starting their own enterprises, playing competitive sport, having great sex – and society doesn’t bat an eye. It is ageist, he argues, to stop people being able to do those things but it’s also ageist to make a big deal of it. Still having sex at 80, still making TV programmes at 90, even running marathons at 100? Why shouldn’t they be?The conclusion Honoré came to, after three years of research and an examination of the way older people are treated around the world, was that it was in many ways a golden age for “the old” (a term he would never use): there were more of them, they were healthier, more active and many were better off than in previous generations. They could no longer be ignored or marginalised. But, in his view, that is just a beginning. “It can be so much better,” he says, “if we move a lot of goalposts and change the way everything from healthcare to politics to the business world to education is organised.” He argues that the idea of being educated between the ages of five and 21, working for 40 years and then retiring on a pension at 60 is completely out of date, imagining a much more fluid way of life where we dip in and out of education and the job market and never formally “retire”.I ask Honoré at what age we become “old”. He refuses to supply a number. “I use the word ‘older’ in a very elastic way,” he says. “The definition is so fluid, and to box people in and say: ‘This is old’ narrows horizons. What do we gain by saying: ‘This person is old’?” He believes ageism is lessening but remains endemic. In fact, he says that when he began the book he was one of its worst proponents. “When I was younger, I was so ageist. I had a dread of growing old. I had bought into that idea that you hit 35 and it’s just a downward spiral. I used to think of old people as just sad and cantankerous. But, if you look at the stats, the people with the highest levels of happiness and life satisfaction in Britain are the over-60s. That doesn’t take away from the fact that many people will be very unhappy, but the story we are told and that we tell ourselves is that everyone is unhappy. It’s always the worst-case scenario: that’s what we are contaminated by.”Honoré no longer frets about ageing. “My biggest worry was that I would end up in a gloomy place,” he says, “but, thankfully, the opposite is true – I feel so much more optimistic now than I did when I embarked on the book. We have created a culture where ageing is seen as a chamber of horrors. There is no chink of light in it. I suspected that was not true, and along the way I found it to be utterly untrue.”B(older): Making the Most of Our Longer Lives is published by Simon \u0026amp Schuster (£16.99)1. If you think of yourself as old, you will be old. The media will bang on about dementia and loneliness, but ignore them. Concentrate on the upside.2. Take yourself out of your comfort zone. Resist being pigeonholed keep experimenting challenge yourself and society’s stereotyping of you.3. Try to stay healthy. Eat well and take lots of exercise – it’s good for brain and body. Exercise doesn’t have to mean playing competitive ice hockey the odd brisk walk will keep you in shape.4. Look for positive role models. Helen Mirren, David Attenborough and, best of all, Michelangelo, who lived until the ripe old age (in 16th-century terms) of 88 and spent the final 20 years of his life designing and overseeing the construction of St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Now that’s a way to go out.5. Seek to become the person you always wanted to be. One reason many people are at their happiest in their 60s is that they feel freer and less beholden to others. They contain all their previous selves and can start to make sense of them.6. Don’t just maintain social connections with your own age group: mix across the generations as much as you can. Inter-generational contact has become increasingly difficult, but if we can do it we benefit – and society benefits.7. Be willing to let stuff go. If that friendship isn’t working, drop it. Streamline your life. There is less time left, so make it count.8. Ageing should be a process of opening rather than closing doors. “We will lose some things – speed, stamina, a bit of mental agility – but in many other respects we gain,” says Honoré. We learn new skills, have greater social awareness, are likely to be more altruistic, are “lighter” in our approach to life – because we are less hung up on creating a good impression – and can see the bigger picture. It may be that we are in a position to make a greater contribution to society in our 60s and 70s than in our so-called prime.9. Honesty is the best policy. Don’t try to pretend you are not 75 or 85 or whatever age you are. “As soon as we start lying about our age, we’re giving the number a terrible power – a power it doesn’t deserve,” says Honoré. People do it because there are so many ageist assumptions attached to age, but the way to fight back is to subvert those assumptions.10. Society tells us that sex, love and romance belong to the young, but it’s not true. Plenty of older people continue to experience the joy of sex. But there are no rules: have as much – or as little – as you want. Some older people see it as a blessed release to escape the shackles of falling in love (and lust), but others can’t imagine life without it. Whatever turns you on.11. Ignore people who say you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. You can. Despite the common perception that creativity is the preserve of the young, we can get more creative as we get older. Our neural networks loosen up and we have the confidence and freedom to challenge groupthink. Honoré was encouraged last year when the Turner prize abolished its age limit for artists. Michelangelo could have been a contender.12. Don’t pretend death isn’t coming. Embrace it – just not yet. “It’s useful to know our lives are bookended,” says Honoré. “When time is running out, it becomes more precious. It gives life shape and, in some ways, meaning.” Don’t dwell morbidly on it, but don’t shy away from it either. The closer you get to it, the less you are likely to fear it and the greater your focus will be on the things that really matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f89ead17626761ea6bfa0b6c86657592661d61e/0_252_3800_2281/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d7935e2d9f0051fd1e53cc5089b4bd5","title":"ditkaland dispatches why chicago should rethink its 80s nostalgia","story":"With the Bears back in the NFL playoffs, it’s time to reevaluate club icon Mike Ditka as a Chicago hero and his zealots as lovable blue-collar guys with funny accentsThree things are certain in Chicago: death, (lots of) taxes, and the instinct to “bear down” on Mike Ditka and his legendary 1985 squad every time a Bears team emerges as a serious contender.Chicago’s WGN News giddily proclaimed that fans “are partying like it’s 1985” shortly after the Bears vanquished the Green Bay Packers and clinched the NFL North title last Sunday. The televised segment included an interview with a middle-aged mustachioed man dressed up like vintage Ditka: aviator sunglasses, tight navy blue sweater, cigar and all. Bushy mustaches are an increasingly familiar sight at Soldier Field this season – even Chicago quarterback Mitch Trubisky, born a year after the coach was fired, got in on the Ditka act for Halloween.When the Bears opted to go with 322lb defensive tackle Akiem Hicks for a fourth and goal carry at the Giants’ one-yard-line earlier this month, many saw it as coach Matt Nagy covering one of Ditka’s greatest hits from ‘85 – when he used William “The Refrigerator” Perry as a hilariously large short yardage back.Thankfully, Nagy’s team hasn’t recorded a Super Bowl Shuffle sequel yet but there’s still time. The “Superfans” would likely approve. For Illinois’s bicentennial celebration event on 3 December, comedians George Wendt and Robert Smigel revived their three-decade-old “Bill Swerski’s Superfans” skit from Saturday Night Live. Dressed in their cartoonish Ditka disguises, they joked that the staging of the original Super Bowl Shuffle ranked as the greatest event in Illinois history, yes, above the Lincoln-Douglas debates.If you’re scoring at home, it’s Ditka 1, Abraham Lincoln 0. While Ditka himself is in a physically weakened state due to a massive heart attack suffered last month, the religion of Iron Mike is stronger than ever in Chicagoland. “You cannot underestimate the effect of the ’85 Bears and Ditka on the Chicago psyche,” John Roach, creator of The Sports Writers on TV on Chicago’s now-defunct SportsChannel told the Ringer. “He still haunts Chicago.”Haunt is the operative word here. There’s a distinct way in which Ditka’s trapped-in-amber-from-1985 folk hero status obscures his actual legacy and the awfulness of his politics. It’s time to reevaluate Ditka as a Chicago hero and hardcore Bears fans as lovable blue-collar guys with funny accents.Let’s go back to those glorious 80s Monsters of the Midway. Ditka famously once said that people who write about the past are “losers and cowards” but the history of the Hall of Fame coach’s career is instructive.Over his decade-long reign of terror leading the Bears, Ditka routinely berated and threatened his players, feuded with fellow coaches, battled with the media, belittled his opponents, and occasionally lit into fans (“You tell me what time and where and I’ll whip your ass. You got that, big boy?” he told “Neal from Northlake” during a 1992 radio call-in show.) In 1987, he was accused of assault after throwing a tantrum in a loss to the San Francisco 49ers in which he struck an opposing fan, a 38-year-old woman, in the head with a massive wad of his chewing gum on his way back to the locker room.Even worse, he cavalierly sent players back into games with concussions, including Jim McMahon, the former star quarterback who now struggles with the early onset of dementia and the brain disease of CTE. Safety Dave Duerson, another standout from the famed ‘85 Bears, committed suicide in 2011 and in death also was diagnosed with CTE. Before he died, Duerson noted that “Mike was not one who gave a damn about the players or their injuries when he was coaching.” Ditka even tried to bust the union – he berated his own players for not crossing a picket line when the NFLPA went on strike in 1987 and called the scabs that played against Buddy Ryan’s Eagles “the real Bears” as the AFL-CIO in Philadelphia threatened a disturbance at the game.In his frank 1992 biography, Armen Keteyian described Ditka as a monster of a man who was a careless, absent father (“I really can’t picture back to one moment when we were really happy,’’ his son Matt is quoted as saying), a bad businessman with a trail of failed ventures, and a member of the one percent who identified as a “common man” when it suited him but when those same common men criticized his decisions, he dismissed them as “losers in life ... $100-a-week guys.”The truth has always been out there. It’s just that when Ditka ruled as a petty tyrant, fans and the media too often celebrated his behavior as hard-nosed toughness or excused it with a smirk and a shrug. C’mon, it’s just boys being boys – Ditka being Ditka. Fans and the media rarely soured on his antics when he was winning football games, but even when his teams failed (his record was a combined 20-44 over his last four seasons coaching the Bears and Saints), Iron Mike remained Teflon Mike when it came to maintaining his reputation as the ultimate “old school” coach.And then there’s his post-coaching career, which for the last two decades has mostly meant playing a caricatured version of himself for television. He’s either hawking whatever product Madison Avenue throws at him – from Coors beer to Vienna Beef hot dogs to (God help us) Iron Mike “male virility supplements” – or he’s grunting about current players being wimps or clowns for NFL broadcasts on NBC, or espousing toxic or reactionary politics. In other words, he’s a grizzled version of Trump.The Trump-Ditka comparison would have been even more perfect had the latter followed through with his plan to run against Barack Obama for US Senate in 2004 (he’d “get the Bubba vote,” House majority leader Tom DeLay said at the time). Ditka eventually bowed out of the race but later claimed he could have beaten Obama and ended his political career then and there. Like many conservatives, Ditka’s rhetoric has grown steadily worse. In 2016, Ditka pronounced Obama “the worst president we’ve ever had” and said he’d vote for Trump.Ditka has also stumped for Illinois governor Bruce Rauner, a billionaire businessman who, like the coach-turned-pitchman and Trump, equates masculinity with a kind of peacocking performance a pantomiming of working-class grittiness. Just as Trump cosplays like he’s in the movie Top Gun while emceeing at military events or pretends to pal around with coal miners, Rauner dons flannel shirts or leather jackets and poses on Harley Davidson motorcycles – also to aim for Ditka’s “Bubba vote”. Granted, Ditka genuinely grew up modestly in Carnegie, Pennslyvania, but has spent most of his adulthood a multi-millionaire who developed a taste for expensive vintage cars and fine wines and owned an extravagant second home in Florida. He left behind his lunch pail decades ago.It was no surprise when Ditka echoed Trump in last year’s controversy involving Colin Kaepernick and other players who took a knee during the anthem by saying he would have kicked the ex-Niners quarterback off his team. “Kaepernick would be an unknown – a complete unknown. He’d be a complete nobody,” Ditka barked. “Nobody would know who he was without the game of football, without the sport he’s playing. Not to respect that, you have to be a pretty unintelligent person, I would think.”I noticed plenty of fans this season who bedeck themselves with Ditka costumes or the team’s wishbone “C” logo but they’re increasingly worn on camouflage versions of Bears gear, like say, an olive-green military-themed Trubisky jersey (the Bears have an entire web page devoted to veterans-themed team merch). Likewise, it’s hard to miss all the SUVs or trucks parked at tailgates decked out with pro-Trump or conservative slogans. I’ve met angry men at Soldier Field who hate leftists more than the Packers.“No one took a knee for our beautiful National Anthem today at the Chicago Bears game!” tweeted someone purporting to be an Indiana man named Rod Stryker who posted a Ditka-like (or Trumpian) rant from the stands of the Bears’ 11 November home game against the Lions. “It would really take a commie loser scum bag like Krapernick to disrespect the Flag \u0026amp Military on Veterans Day at Soldier Field. Notice the stadium is packed with PATRIOTS who love America.”There were plenty of reasons why Stryker, whose puckish avatar is a photoshopped image of Alexander Hamilton in a Maga hat, might feel right at home. That boycott of the NFL that conservatives loudly supported on social media last year after Trump encouraged them to do so in response to the anthem controversy? Instead of staying away from each other, If anything conservatives and the NFL appear to be engaged in a season-long recommitment ceremony to each other. If you’re a right-wing Bears fan, you really can go home again – especially if you never really left.A kind of authoritarian conservatism has always hummed in the background of the NFL experience, but in 2018 we can see how it’s curdled to the point where we get Trump as president and Ditka as his patron saint – all cheered on by today’s real-life Super Fans, a demographic disproportionately made up of aggrieved right-wing culture warriors who want to make the NFL and America great again by yelling at black players who don’t stand for the national anthem.The truth is: it’s kind of hard to rewatch those Super Fan skits these days and listen to the worship for the “Da Coach” and “Da Bearsss”. It now sounds too much like an unquestioning, “post-truth” devotion to a dictator-like leader–no matter if they’re the kind who favors sweater vests and steakhouses or expensive suits and skyscrapers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49eef654dbe73fa10866e6bad1b711547461df4f/1_0_3870_2323/master/3870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7303695388b7dd7d02fc313a814e779c","title":"how can you tell if a mobile phone has good reception before you buy it","story":"Paul lives in a signal black spot where his wife’s smartphone still works. Is there a way to find if phone has good reception?I have a Moto 3 smartphone and my wife has a similar earlier model. We are right on the edge of reception from EE. I can just get a very weak signal if I attach my phone to a selfie stick and lean out of a window, or walk up the bank behind the house. This is not ideal.Away from home, sometimes my wife’s phone can get a strong signal whereas mine can’t get a signal at all. This made me wonder if there was a measurement to assess how good a mobile phone is at receiving signals in areas of poor reception before you buy it … and if there is an easy way for an ordinary punter to understand it. PaulPhone manufacturers and others can and do test their phones, usually for certification purposes. The performance test results you want, if you can get them, are the Total Isotropic Sensitivity (TIS) value for reception and the Total Radiated Power (TRP) for transmission.These probably don’t qualify as easy for an ordinary punter to understand. Also, they are derived by testing performance in ideal conditions with a simulated base station in an anechoic chamber, not with a fading signal on a wet and windy hillside.Either way, I don’t think phone manufacturers are likely to use TIS in their marketing. There are too many variables for it to be a reliable guide to real-world reception. For example, studies have found significant differences between holding a phone in the left hand and holding it in the right hand, which I assume is connected with the way manufacturers position their antenna(s). The size of your hands and the angle at which you hold the phone also make a difference.The tests were created by the CTIA – originally the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association – to certify wireless devices’ over-the-air performance, and a brief glance at the 591-page PDF will show how complicated it is. For example, you could measure peak performance with a directional aerial, but then users would have to orient the phone towards the unseen transmitter for the best results. Instead, the CTIA requires the “average spherical effective radiated receiver sensitivity (TIS) to be measured”. This should mean a phone works equally well in all directions, but it’s complicated to calculate and still a compromise.Another problem is making antennas work with different 2G, 3G and 4G phone networks that operate at different frequencies. A phone that works well with GSM 900 might be terrible with UMTS 2100. The downside of having a phone that talks to most networks is that it won’t be optimised for the one you actually use.Also, because human bodies have not been standardised, TIS and TRP measurements are made with dummy heads and hands filled with liquid. Results may vary if you use real people.In the end, the only measurements that matter are the ones you get with your head and hands with the specific frequencies used by your EE network. We are left with “ask a friend” and the not-very-helpful “try it and see”.I couldn’t find much public research into mobile phone reception with commercial phones, presumably because of some of the problems mentioned above. Professor Gert Frølund Pedersen tested nine phones in Denmark in 2012 (PDF), while in the UK, Ofcom used the CTIA test to check 10 off-the-shelf phones in 2016 (PDF).Ofcom withheld the names of the phones it tested because there weren’t enough samples to show statistically significant differences – it tested three of each device – and because “no handset outperformed the others across different frequency bands and technologies”. Knowing the names would therefore not help consumers.However, Ofcom did point out that the non-smartphones outperformed the smartphones, and that “some of the smartphones tested required over 10x (10dB) more power than the best performing non-smartphone”.You could always buy a cheap Nokia for making voice calls.Last year, Ireland’s ComReg (Commission for Communications Regulation) tested 71 mobile phones that were available on the Irish market in June 2017. The aim was to “quantify the minimum signal level(s) required to make or receive a mobile call and to stream data” (PDF).ComReg names names and gives results, but only for TRP (active transmission) not TIS (reception). It doesn’t explain why. The CTIA test recommends that TRP and TIS are tested concurrently, because a phone’s internal components (processor, memory and so on) generate electrical noise that affects reception.StellaDoradus has published a table of the results, which includes some strikingly low numbers for some popular phones. I wouldn’t use it as the sole basis for a purchasing decision.Most tests assume that all models of a particular phone will perform in the same way, but Ofcom found differences. As with other products, phones that look identical can vary. In some cases, they may have been assembled in different countries, and use slightly different components. In others, the circuitry may have been revised between editions. Even if the internal components seem to be the same, there could be some sample variation, without a phone actually being faulty.This makes me wonder if your Moto 3 is below average in reception performance. In most cases, no one would ever know, but you are literally an “edge case”. With a new phone, it might be worth asking the supplier for a different sample, but it may be too late for that.It would be interesting to know what would happen if you swapped phones and sims with your wife. You may have a bigger capacitance than your wife, electronically speaking, and possibly much bigger hands. Both can and do affect reception. If your Moto 3 works better in her hands, then either you or your sim are degrading the performance. It might be worth getting a new sim.As you already know, using your phone on a selfie stick can improve performance. You may also get better reception by not touching the phone and using the built-in speakerphone.You could also try using a signal booster or repeater. These used to be illegal, but on 12 April last year, Ofcom approved the use of some models in homes and road vehicles “but not in boats or static caravans”. However, check carefully because illegal signal boosters are still available.Have you got a question?

Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application.

There are a number of former members of the military and intelligence services, many of them women. There are seasoned veterans of past presidential administrations and a handful of political neophytes who never held office before running for Congress in 2018.A record 102 women will be sworn into the House on Thursday, 35 of whom were elected for the first time in November in a historic wave of success for female candidates.“We’re in the building. Swearing in tomorrow,” the congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York captioned a photograph of her and five incoming female colleagues, posing in the US Capitol.The arrival of this large new group will significantly alter the balance of power in Washington, where the federal government is currently paralysed by a shutdown stretching into its 13th day.Democrats will regain control of the House on Thursday eight years after losing power. Their takeover was fuelled by 63 Democrats whose victories in the November midterm elections helped the party win by the largest margins since the Watergate scandal in 1974.Nancy Pelosi is all but assured of reclaiming her former title as speaker of the House. She made history in 2007 as the first woman to hold the position, before handing over the gavel when the GOP won the House in 2011. The Republicans will be led by Kevin McCarthy of California.“I think of it is a responsibility,” Pelosi told Today when asked how she felt about being the most powerful woman in Washington. “I don’t think of it as an accomplishment… This isn’t breaking a glass ceiling – this is breaking a marble ceiling in the Capitol of the United States.”Pelosi is poised to become one of few elected officials to regain the gavel, and the first for more than 50 years.“When our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class,” Pelosi is expected to say on Thursday, according to a preview of her remarks. “Working together, we will redeem the promise of the American dream for every family, advancing progress for every community.”As in years past, proud relatives and curious members of the public will fill the House and Senate galleries as the 116th Congress is sworn in and new leaders are elected. But this year the faces will look different – more erse and more female.Rashida Tlaib, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Michigan, announced on Instagram that she would wear a traditional Palestinian thobe – a long-sleeved, ankle-length garment – when being sworn in. Ilhan Omar, an incoming Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota, will swear the oath of office on her grandfather’s Qur’an.In an Instagram post, her father recounted the family’s journey from a refugee camp in Kenya to the US, where they first arrived at an “airport in Washington DC”.“I could never have dreamed that 23 years later I would return to the same airport with my daughter Ilhan by my side, the day before she is to be sworn in as the first Somali-American elected to the United States Congress,” he wrote.Congressman Jim Langevin, a Democrat from Rhode Island and the first quadriplegic person elected to Congress, will preside over the chamber on the first day.After the speaker is elected, the newly empowered Democratic majority will vote on an internal rules package designed to bring more transparency to congressional governance, a measure that has already exposed ideological tensions within the party. Two prominent progressives, Ocasio-Cortez and Congressman Ro Khanna of California, said they would oppose the package, arguing that the rules would hinder liberals’ ability to advance their ambitious social agenda.Democrats will then turn to their first major order of business: a spending package that would end the government shutdown.The party is unified on the legislation but Donald Trump has said he will refuse to sign the bill, which does not include funding for his border wall.The vote will be the first test of their power – and an indication of the battles to come in a newly ided government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47d23f840492ae3aaddb789c113088552c64a4eb/0_227_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a829c297ae04e5a843b278db8b7c60d8","title":"behind el chapo trial joaquin guzman","story":"The alleged Mexican drug kingpin’s trial resumes on Thursday but, amid riveting testimony so far, strange silences have lurkedThe tectonic plates beneath a big mafia trial shift out of sight from the proceedings, but occasionally there is a glimpse of the bigger picture. The trial of the alleged Sinaloa cartel chief Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán – which resumes on Thursday – has been no exception. The proceedings have offered extraordinary detail of the workings of a Mexican cartel, but have been hallmarked by what is unseen – and kept that way by Judge Brian Cogan.Day-to-day testimony has been like a Netflix thriller, yet it has obscured  the nexus of top-level corruption the world’s biggest criminal organisation operated north and south of the US border.The detail from cartel “snitches” testifying for the prosecution against their old boss or partner has been riveting. Guzmán’s first employee, pilot Miguel Ángel Martínez, described a trip with Guzmán to Japan, Thailand and Macau, and a visit they made to Los Angeles to spend $6m on planes before a gambling spree in Las Vegas. Guzmán went to Switzerland, he said, for cellular anti-ageing treatment.Guzmán ran a private zoo, and distributed bonus diamond-studded Rolexes and fancy cars to favourite underlings. Cocaine was smuggled to the US in what looked like cans of jalapeño peppers. Even Guzmán – usually pensive – laughed when his lawyer William Purpura, picked up one of the cans entered in evidence, and told the court: “I’ve been dying to hold this one.”The former chief of Colombia’s Norte del Valle cartel, Juan Carlos Ramírez Abadía – alias La Chupeta, the Lollipop – gave enthralling evidence about one of the most important partnerships in narco-trafficking history, after Guzmán impressed the Colombian with his insistence on only the best-quality product, speed of delivery – and his demand for an extra percentage.Ramírez, his face disfigured by plastic surgery, boasted about the 400,000 kilos of cocaine he had moved, and 150 executions he had ordered – including a family in New Jersey. His testimony also traced Guzmán’s takeover of Colombian distribution networks in the US while Ramírez did a short stretch in jail. Another Colombian narco, Jorge Cifuentes, testified to having furnished rightwing Colombian paramilitaries with 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles with which to fight leftwing Farc guerrillas, but then arranging a cocaine deal between Guzmán and the Farc. The first we heard of Guzmán’s voice was on a wiretap, expertly haggling with the comrades.The narco witnesses have offered detailed, sometimes darkly funny testimony they are proud of what they did. Asked at one point about the killing of two female Colombian police agents, Chupeta gave a thumbs-up. His only apparent remorse was at the loss of two loads to US authorities.The star turn was the Sinaloa cartel accountant Jesús Zambada García (brother of the drug lord who probably betrayed Guzmán and now leads the cartel, Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada), who testified with cool aplomb about his “investors”, “costs” and “returns”.In his coverage of the trial, David Brooks of the Mexican daily La Jornada wrote: “Chapo Guzmán was one of the successful impresarios of a Mexican neoliberal model, heading a transnational commercial and financial operation dedicated to satisfying an insatiable demand in the US, generating hundreds of millions of dollars monthly for Mexico.”But Guzmán must go down as a big-catch criminal, and that is where the riptides beneath the surface matter.Italian mafia parlance calls it “dietrologia” – “behindology”, the science of what lies behind appearances. And what lies behind the Chapo trial comprises the corruption of the Mexican state, what became of Guzmán’s money, the role of the turncoat witnesses – and that of the US government in running and recruiting them.Zambada García admitted bribing airport authorities, federal police and even Interpol, and said the cartel’s man in government, Genaro García Luna, was paid one instalment of $3m while head of the federal investigation agency, then another after being appointed minister for public security. Similar allegations against García Luna had previously been made in Mexico, including in two books by the journalist Anabel Hernández. In a statement to Mexican media, García Luna denied the allegation, which he described as “a lie, defamation and perjury”.But Zambada García also alleged that García Luna was paid $56m by Guzmán’s affiliates the Beltrán Leyva brothers, one of whom, Héctor, was responsible for paying off politicians. Héctor Beltrán Leyva died in a Mexican jail the night before Zambada García’s testimony.According to discussion during a sidebar between counsel and the judge, Zambada planned to go one better and elaborate on a $6m payment to an “incumbent” Mexican president. He was stopped from doing so by a prosecutors’ motion, upheld by Judge Cogan, “protecting iniduals and entities who are not parties to this case and who would face embarrassment”, he said.The trial chamber – and the Mexican people – cannot, then, know which president was allegedly paid by Guzmán, and for what. A subsequent sidebar discussed the contents of a prosecution memorandum submitted under seal the transcript of the sidebar was then itself sealed.When John Gotti – head of the Gambino mafia clan – went on trial in this same New York courthouse in 1992, it took just one “cooperating witness” to convict him.In Guzmán’s trial, Mexican narcos are lining up to testify: six so far, and as many as 10 more to follow.Guzmán’s lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman calls them “degenerates” who will say anything to get sentences commuted. During the first week of the Guzmán trial, on 9 November, Vicente Zambada Nieblo – “El Vicentillo” – pleaded guilty in Chicago to overseeing logistics for the Sinaloa cartel and trafficking vast quantities of cocaine and heroin through that city. Vicentillo is El Mayo’s son, and the accountant’s nephew.His 19-page plea was entered suddenly, a year after Vicentillo had agreed with US authorities to cooperate “in any matter” – making him conveniently available to testify against Guzmán in New York. Vicentillo does not contest a staggering $1.3bn forfeiture.But Zambada Nieblo is more than just a turncoat: a year-long investigation by the Mexican newspaper El Universal, published in October 2017, established definitively that Vicentillo had worked for the DEA while conducting his duties for the cartel.Guzmán’s lawyers may not get to pursue these relationships, which complicate the usual narrative of good, honest DEA detective work, even though an addendum to a Department of Justice audit of the agency, published in March 2017, voiced “specific concerns about how the DEA used and paid confidential sources”, with “potential implications for national security”.Also excluded was an attempt by the defence to ask prosecution witnesses about “Operation Fast and Furious”, a project run by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to allow weapons to enter Mexico illegally, through cooperating straw-buyers, in hopes of catching their final recipients.Of the 2,000 guns allowed to “walk” between 2007 and 2011, only 665 were recovered, one of them in Guzmán’s’s lair in 2014 – but none of this can feature at trial.The evidence about money has been detailed when it is “back in Mexico”, but coy when it moves beyond there. Martínez flew planes loaded with cash – between $8m and $10m from Tijuana three times a month – and hauled a Samsonite case filled with $10m to “a Mexico City bank” monthly. Cash deposits are described hidden beneath beds and even underwater.But there the money-trail ends, though the US Senate’s and Department of Justice’s own investigations have established that hundreds of millions proceeded through the Wachovia and HSBC banks north of the border – these play no part in evidence hitherto.So the Guzmán trial, as the US government and Judge Cogan conduct it, follows the focused “kingpin” strategy, which supposes that once a cartel leader is taken down, the war on drugs is being won. Yet more cocaine is leaving Colombia than ever, and last year was Mexico’s most violent since this phase of the drug wars began.As his trial resumes next week, Guzmán is old news back in Mexico: initiative is with the rising Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación and its leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho”. One day, El Chapo himself might testify against El Mencho – if he ever gets caught that may be Guzmán’s only chance of seeing his seven-year-old twin daughters as a free man."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af24f4769acc653c32759678792c85556c63c879/465_930_2341_1404/master/2341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a445ee97211918934720545db3592659","title":"seaching for scrap in guatemala city in pictures","story":"Workers known as guajeros descend daily to search for recyclable items at one of the biggest rubbish dumps in Guatemala City.

File image: Rui VieiraPA WireThe Irish arm of retail giant Tesco has been ordered to pay €4,000 to a worker who was sacked after admitting to taking a bottle of wine out of a store without paying for it.Retail worker Anne Faherty was dismissed by Tesco Ireland on March 29th 2016 arising from an incident on January 13th 2016 when she was intercepted by a security officer as she left the store at the end of her shift.Ms Faherty had a bottle of wine in her bag valued at less than €20 which she had not paid for. She said she had forgotten to pay for the wine, and now she has successfully sued for unfair dismissal at the Labour Court which found the decision to dismiss her “was tainted with procedural unfairness”.However, it also found Ms Faherty contributed substantially to her own dismissal and this had to be taken into account in measuring the quantum of compensation that should be awarded.The Labour Court ordered Tesco Ireland to pay Ms Faherty €4,000 in a decision that upholds an earlier ruling made by an adjudication officer at the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) which Tesco Ireland had appealed.In her evidence, Ms Faherty said that at around 5.45pm on January 13th 2016 she left her work station to select some items of personal shopping including two bottles of wine as she was due to finish her shift at 6pm.Ms Faherty stated that in the course of that activity she encountered an acquaintance who had had a bereavement and whose mother was unwell. Ms Fah erty said that she was upset by the encounter.Ms Faherty said she put one of the bottles of wine in her bag as she did not want to drop it.The security guard then intercepted Ms Faherty after she left the store and she was escorted to an office where a duty manager attended and suspended Ms Faherty until further notice.Ms Faherty stated that she had made a mistake concerning the bottle of wine as a result of the upset that she had experienced when she met an acquaintance.In its submission, Tesco stated that CCTV footage clearly showed Ms Faherty removing a bottle of wine from the store without paying and that the footage showed no evidence of upset on the part of Ms Faherty following her conversation with an acquaintance in the store.The Tesco-employed security guard told the Labour Court hearing that he took the decision not to call the Garda because the bottle concerned had a value of less than €20.Tesco dismissed Ms Faherty for breach of its ‘honesty policy’ and its staff purchase policy and because the bond of trust between employee and employer had broken down.In its findings, the Labour Court noted that at no stage of the investigative or disciplinary process was Ms Faherty supplied with a copy of Tesco’s honesty or staff purchase policies which she was contended to have breached."},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy

File image: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he and German chancellor Angela Merkel both agreed to stand by the Brexit withdrawal agreement in a phone call on Thursday morning. Speaking after a Cabinet meeting in Dublin, Mr Varadkar said he and Ms Merkel had a long conversation at her request. “We spoke for about 40 minutes,” he said. “The conversation focused on securing the ratification of the withdrawal agreement which, as you know, will be put to the House of Commons in about two weeks’ time. “We agreed that we would stand by the agreement we made with the United Kingdom at the end of last year. We are happy to offer reassurance and guarantees to the United Kingdom but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November. We also discussed ‘no deal’ planning.”Planning for a “no deal” scenario has also been discussed by the Cabinet in Dublin.“It was quite a long call, it was an opportunity to kind of brainstorm a bit as to what we could do to assist prime minister May in securing ratification of the withdrawal agreement,” the Taoiseach said.There have been calls from the United Kingdom for clarifications that the backstop - the insurance policy to avoid a hard border even if there is no future EU-UK trade deal - will be temporary.Mr Varadkar said the backstop was always only meant to hold “unless and until” a future trade deal that avoided a hard border was in place.He said it would be “helpful” for other EU leaders to know what kind of assurances would command a majority in the House of Commons.“What would be helpful for us as EU prime ministers and presidents would be to know what clarifications would be enough to secure a majority in the House of Commons but always understanding that clarifications, understandings, guarantees, explanations cannot go against the spirit or render inoperable parts of the withdrawal agreement. That would be a renegotiation.”The Taoiseach said there would be contact between Irish and British Brexit officials on Friday, and he and UK prime minister Theresa May would speak afterwards if required.Of his conversation with Ms Merkel, the Taoiseach said: “What we both really agreed was this was a problem that was created in London. Brexit was a problem created in the United Kingdom, the inability of the United Kingdom to ratify the withdrawal agreement is a problem in Westminster and we are really looking to them for a solution.“Those who create a problem must be the ones who have a responsibility to come up with a solution. It is up to them to make a proposal but it has to be a proposal that we can accept. So it can’t be a proposal that contradicts what is already in the withdrawal agreement.“It can’t be something that renders the backstop inoperable, for example. We want to be in a position to give guarantees, to give assurances. We need to know what the United Kingdom parliament wants in terms of those guarantees and those clarifications. “This is something we will have to see develop over the next week or two. Bear in mind the UK government has approved this agreement. The difficulty is the UK government appears unable, at this point in time, to secure ratification from the House of Commons. That is where the difficulty at the moment lies.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

though some suggest these figures are an overestimate.But in the first study to track the strain of cholera responsible for the outbreak, scientists using genome sequencing have found that migration is behind the introduction of the disease into the country.The strain originated in South Asia in 2012, according to the research published in Nature journal on Tuesday, but spread to Yemen from East Africa. Yemen has long been a crossroads for trade and communications between Africa and Asia, and the current epidemic is closely linked to recent outbreaks in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Cholera is a diarrhoeal disease, transmitted through contaminated food and water, which is most prevalent in regions with poor sanitation. In Yemen, where there has been more than three years of conflict, around 16 million of the 29 million inhabitants have no access to safe water and basic sanitation. “We know that a lack of sanitation and hygiene, population displacement and war are directly linked to large-scale outbreaks,” said Professor Nick Thomson, one of the report’s lead authors. “The difference is that we now know that it’s the movement of the bacterial agent causing cholera across and between countries that links these large-scale outbreaks together.”“In the past we have considered that we are in essence victims to fortune for local pools of the bacterium causing cholera, but we now have a new window into the disease,” he added. Prof Thomson said the research will allow better targeted interventions against cholera and help estimate the risk of future outbreaks in regions like Yemen -potentially reducing the impact of future epidemics. But the researchers, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Institut Pasteur, also found that the strain in Yemen is more susceptible to antibiotics than other types of cholera. “Surprisingly, we discovered the cholera strain causing the Yemen outbreaks is less resistant to antibiotics than related strains,” said Dr Daryl Domman, a visiting scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. “The strain causing the Yemeni cholera epidemic has deleted four genes responsible for resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, making itself more vulnerable to treatment.”Newsletter promotion -

Brussels is the country’s third federal region and the mayor of the leafy suburb of Wezembeek-Oppem made news last summer when he claimed to have spotted a UFO.Belgian UFO investigators told the  that the 2018 figures were a return to the form shown over the last five years.Despite being smaller than Switzerland, Belgium has regularly punched above its weight when it comes to UFO sightings. Even in 2017, a relatively fallow year, it outscored Norway, Finland and Denmark and recorded only a handful fewer sightings than its much larger neighbour France.From November 1989 to April 1990, Belgian UFO spotters enjoyed their golden age. The Belgian UFO Wave involved multiple reports of triangular shaped craft in Belgian skies over an extended period, including one which was chased by F-16 fighter jets.Patrick Ferryn, president of Cobeps, the francophone Belgian committee for the study of space phenomena, said, “You must know that most of these sightings will have the most banal explanation but there is a residue, which we simply can’t explain. And of those, there may be two or three where we may have questions over where they came from.“We don’t know why the numbers have increased this year. It was a hot summer and it may be simply that when the weather is good and the skies are clear, people look at the skies more often,” he added.Out of the 76 sightings in Wallonia, 14 were explained, 12 probably explained and 28 were impossible to evaluate because there was too little information. There were “reasonable doubts” about eight sightings, although the witness accounts lacked important information.14 were still under investigation by Cobeps, which last reported an inexplicable UFO sighting in 2015, when there were 317 sightings across the country.Is there alien life out there? 10 celebrities who have seen UFOsIn 2018 the majority of sighting were explained away as being planes, balloons, meteors and satellites. The culpable satellite normally turned out to be the International Space Station.Between 2010 and 2016, more than half of Belgian UFOs turned out to be Chinese lanterns, a decorative candle powered hot air balloon.“Surprisingly drones have still not had an impact,” said Mr Ferryn, “Ever since the first drones went on the shelves we have been waiting to be submerged with reports of a galactic invasion of drones – but it still has not happened.”Mr Ferryn said there was simply no comparison with the famous Belgian UFO Wave, which has been dismissed by some as a mass delusion. There is no video or photographic evidence of the craft despite the many sightings. “This is definitely not a new wave of the Belgian wave of UFOs,” he said, “Then the quantity of sightings was higher, more frequent and concentrated on one region of Belgium and all the descriptions were similar rather than the very different descriptions of last year.”Nancy Pelosi declines to rule out impeaching Donald Trump ahead of expected election to House SpeakerRussia charges detained American Paul Whelan with espionageComment: Sorry Mr Gove, but Theresa May\u0026#39s Brexit deal traps Britain in the EU\u0026#39s failing museum of farmingLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowSNP Transport Minister admits rail travellers being hit with \u0026#39unwelcome\u0026#39 fare rises for substandard serviceRubbish and goods wash ashore as 270 containers lost off Dutch coastAbu Hamza\u0026#39s son questioned over doorman\u0026#39s Mayfair murder as he is charged with gun crimesPolice officer caught by colleagues behind wheel while almost twice the limit allowed to keep licenceFar-Right vigilante groups take to streets of small German town following migrant violenceArrest of \u0026#39yellow vest\u0026#39 figurehead prompts calls for \u0026#39hardening\u0026#39 of French protests\u0026#39Meghan Markle mania\u0026#39 sparks surge in demand for etiquette lessons across the USBritish Army targets \u0026#39snowflakes, binge gamers and me, me, me millennials\u0026#39 in new recruitment driveStudent drug dealers spared jail as judge says he was impressed by the grammar in their text messages\u0026#39Assad will stay for a while, thanks to Russian support\u0026#39, says Jeremy Hunt Obesity should be classed as a \u0026#39disease\u0026#39 doctors say From Catastrophe to Good Omens: the best TV to look forward to in winter 2019Ramsgate harbour dredging begins amid plans to reopen ferry services ahead of potential no-deal Brexit Ireland wants hundreds of millions in EU aid to mitigate damage of no-deal BrexitGang steals €2.3m from security van in Italy, ripping the back open \u0026#39like a can of tuna\u0026#39Chris Packham challenges 250-year-old New Forest hunt to chase him instead of a foxWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/28/18/web-john-vickers-get_0.jpg","title":"bank england women financial policy committee dame colette bowe jayne anne gadia","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearOne popular idea is that regardless of bitcoin\u0027s utility as a means of financial transaction, it can and will continue to act as a store of value, like a form of digital gold.\u0026nbspSo what do the next 10 years, or 20 birthdays, hold for bitcoin? One thing many cryptocurrency analysts\u0026nbspagree upon is that price volatility will steadily decrease, thanks to a combination of its finite supply and regulation designed to help the market\u0026nbspstabilise and mature.Bitcoin price predictions for 2019: From $0 to $36,000, experts weigh Whilst some critics still argue, for varying reasons, as to the longevity of\u0026nbspbitcoin, the next 10 years should at the very least provide many more talking points and events to document its life,\u0026nbspDavid Thomas, director of Mayfair-based cryptocurrency broker\u0026nbspGlobalBlock, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.If, as expected, increased regulation enters the market then bitcoin will be opened up to a broader investor base, and with increased adoption, we expect to see volatility reduce and stability increase both of which will establish bitcoin and cryptocurrencies further as an asset class in their own right.10th birthday has prompted speculation about the cryptocurrency\u0027s future (Rock Star Pastries Composite)Bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology is also expected to continue to drive an entire industry of new applications.\u0026nbspVladislav Dramaliev, head of digital marketing at aeternity, believes this is where bitcoin\u0027s real promise lies.Mr\u0026nbspDramaliev\u0026nbspdescribes bitcoin\u0027s inception as starting a curious revolution, but believes the word evolution will be more appropriate to describe the next decade of bitcoin and blockchain\u0027s growth.One of the most incredible developments is that, 10 years after that first block was mined, there is actually a whole\u0026nbspindustry\u0026nbspbased around this fantastic technology. Today we have a mind-bogglingly erse range of iniduals and companies in the sphere, covering every possible spectrum of opinion, vision for the future, and agenda, he said.The public blockchain infrastructure is getting better and better, more developers are getting interested in blockchain applications, more entrepreneurs are looking for the next killer app, and more users are playing with digital assets on a blockchain. I don’t expect this process to slow down.

Business communities won\u0027t forgive politicians who allow this to happen, by default or otherwise.Given the magnitude of the recruitment difficulties faced by firms clear across the UK, business concerns about the government\u0027s recent blueprint for future immigration rules must be taken seriously and companies must be able to access skills at all levels without heavy costs or bureaucracy.Suren Thiru, the BCC\u0027s head of economics added: Our latest survey suggests that UK economic conditions were worryingly subdued in the final quarter of 2018, with a number of key indicators continuing to weaken under the weight of persistent Brexit uncertainty and rising cost pressures.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk.

It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHFor a fleeting moment, Bros were the biggest band in Britain. Between 1987-89, they achieved eight UK top 10 singles, sold out London’s Wembley Stadium,\u0026nbspand enjoyed a huge fanbase, dubbed “Brosettes”. Their debut album\u0026nbspPush\u0026nbsptopped the charts in 19 countries, and sold more than seven million copies.\u0026nbspAfter the Screaming StopsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Previous studies have suggested\u0026nbspblue light emitted from the screens of laptops and smartphones can contribute to\u0026nbspblindness.\u0026nbspIn August, research by scientists from the University of Toledo, Ohio, revealed that prolonged exposure to the short-wavelength light triggers the generation of toxic molecules in the eye\u0027s light-sensitive cells.\u0026nbspIs Facebook finished? \u0027We\u0027re not far from Zuckerberg subpoena\u0027This process can lead to macular degeneration, a condition that results in blurred or no vision in the centre of the vision field.While it is thought that dark modes can help reduce eye strain, no studies have provided conclusive proof of whether the feature helps prevent this type of damage. Some experts have also questioned whether blue light can cause permanent eye damage.\u0026nbsp“Looking at artificial blue light for prolonged periods may increase eye strain and affect sleep patterns, so using ‘Dark Mode’ may help with this,\u0026nbspHenry Leonard, optometrist and head of clinical and regulatory at the Association of Optometrists, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.However, there is currently insufficient evidence to suggest that exposure to blue light from devices such as mobile phones causes permanent damage to the eye, including the retina, or increase the risk of eye conditions.\u0026nbspFacebook Messenger follows several other popular apps to introduce the feature, including YouTube, Google Maps and Firefox.WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook, is expected to introduce a similar feature later this year.As well as avoiding shining bright screens into people\u0027s eyes, dark modes can also improve battery life. Phones that use OLED displays do not need to light up parts of the screen that are black, potentially reducing the energy needed while the app is open.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/16/istock-649900756.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-3906706  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/07/16/istock-649900756.jpg","title":"fortnite ninja earnings net worth twitch stream youtube 2018","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In a strange run of events, Apple froze trading on its stock and was forced to announce that its results were about to disappoint its investors.The announcement was meant primarily for Apple\u0027s shareholders, and the wide circle of analysts and financial markets that revolve around them. Tim Cook\u0027s letter announcing the change was addressed to its investors, and included information intended for them.As an indication of how rare such a statement\u0026nbspis, Apple has not done this since 2002 – long before the iPhone, and just months into the iPod era.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFor investors and Apple itself, it\u0027s a worrying announcement about the future of the iPhone, and an admission that it was not going where it thought. That has happened for a whole host of reasons – many of them not really connected to the iPhone itself, or even Apple.But the announcement could make a difference to Apple fans and iPhone users in a wide variety of not immediately obvious ways, some of which could be positive. It is one of the most important announcements about the future of its star handset that Apple has ever made, and so will matter in some small way to everyone who uses an iPhone or will do in the future.It matters, primarily, because Apple said that people are not buying as many iPhones\u0026nbspas expected, or as it needed to sell to ensure that its investors were happy. That, in turn, means that it will most likely adjust its strategy to try and make people buy more.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

At this biennial event, the participating companies exhibit their latest service robotic technologies and componentsThe robot developed by Seed Solutions sings and dances to music during the Japan Robot Week 2016 at Tokyo Big SightSome of the reasons people are not buying enough are both specific and too general for Apple to do anything about. But others revolve around central parts of Apple\u0027s strategy, which touch on all of its customers.In his letter announcing the weaker than expected results, Mr\u0026nbspCook cited a number of reasons to the drop. He pointed above all to weakness in China\u0027s economy – in part caused by an ongoing trade war between it and the US – but he also said that there were problems elsewhere, too.Chief among the other reasons for Apple\u0027s weaker than expected performance is likely to be the higher prices that it has started to charge for its iPhones, as well as other products.Gradually, Apple has pushed up the prices for both the cheapest versions of its new phones and the ones at the very top of the line. Over the last couple of years, Apple has changed its pricing strategy so that the cheapest model of the phone – the XR, which starts at $749 – would have been at the top end in the years that went before.As well as leading people to think twice about whether they can afford or want to pay that much for a new iPhone, the higher prices came at the same time Apple announced a wide-ranging and heavily discounted program to allow people to replace their phone\u0027s batteries. That came in response to a controversy that raged at Christmas last year, amid\u0026nbspsuggestions that Apple was intentionally slowing down old phones.Apple suggested that a higher-than-expected number of people taking up that deal – presumably in part because the battery replacements were so cheap, and a whole new phone was so expensive – had also helped dampen demand. At the same time, Apple made keeping an old phone more appealing in other ways, such as the new iOS 12 update that sped older handsets\u0026nbspup dramatically.That as well as other factors mean that people are holding onto their old iPhones for a longer period of time. And that means they\u0027re not buying new ones, hurting Apple.The company\u0027s response is still unknown and could come in a variety of forms. Apple might choose to cut the price of its most expensive models in future, for instance, meaning that the next phone will cost less it could also try and ramp up improvements in the coming years to ensure that the new handsets remain more compelling.Whatever happens, Apple appears to have been forced to realise that it has pushed the top end of the iPhone\u0027s pricing too far. Customers have given their verdict by just not buying the phones – and it will now be Apple\u0027s turn to try and convince them otherwise.It might also be that Apple turns towards its other products, at the same time, in an attempt to ersify away from the handset that represents a vast part of its profits. It has already been looking to focus on services such as Apple Music to ensure that customers still give it money even after they\u0027ve bought their products, and has been branching out further into accessories with the release of the AirPods, HomePod and more.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/10/29/17/iphone.jpg","title":"iphone apple battery replacement cheap last date price swap store","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

For the moment, a new battery costs only £25 – but once the new year arrives, that will rocket up to as much as £65.Old batteries can cause significant problems for their owners as iPhones age. With use, the power begins to drop – something that can lead to phones lasting for much less time, and to Apple having to slow down phones to ensure that they don\u0027t crash because they\u0027re not getting enough power.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt was the revelation that Apple was doing that – throttling performance on older phones, in line with more spectacular rumours that swirled before it was admitted – that led to the cheap repairs in the first place.When that story came out over the Christmas period in 2017, Apple apologised and said that as part of a range of ways of making it up to customers it would knock down the price of replacements, allowing people to restore their phone\u0027s performance if their battery had been degraded.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

Once the programme is over, the same service will cost £45 for most phones, and a full £65 for the iPhone X.Apple gives governments increased access to phone dataThe iPhone X recently became eligible for the throttling, which Apple still applies to more strained batteries to ensure they perform properly. One of the other forms of restitution offered to users was the option to turn that off, which can be found in Settings.Phones that are covered by its warranty period or extended AppleCare coverage will remain free, as they always have been.As the end of the year approaches, Apple Stores appear to be especially busy with users rushing to take advantage of the offer. Genius Bar appointments can be few and far between, though some customers have had success turning up at stores.The replacements require that a battery is sufficiently degraded, which will be checked by Geniuses at the store but can be seen by heading to the Battery options in the Settings app. But some customers appear to have successfully had batteries that are not under the critical 80 per cent mark swapped out all the same.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debate"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg  width= 1254  height= 836  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/27/12/samsung-galaxy-s10-leak-camera.jpg","title":"samsung galaxy s10 release date price camera specs camera screen leaks","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

On first glance, the clan at its centre are just like any other, but their impulsive decision to take in a missing girl begins a series of rug-pulls you wouldn’t expect from a film such as this. A complex heartbreaker, albeit one that starts out looking like the more modest family dramas Kore-eda is known for.  “We knew there was a bad version of this movie that could exist,” said Game Night’s co-director John Francis Daley (the kid from Freaks and Geeks). This certainly isn’t it. Starring Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams as a competitive married couple who mistake an actual kidnapping for a particularly immersive role play game, Game Night is snappy, witty and fully committed to its brilliant, tonally unsettling conceit.  315 13. Isle of DogsAny Wes Anderson film is likely to be offbeat, fastidiously stylish and shot through with the auteur\u0027s understated drollery. Isle of Dogs is no different. A stop-motion story of abandoned canines taking on a corrupt human government, it\u0027s set in a futuristic Japan and deals with some pretty heavy themes (fascism, ethnic cleansing). Funny and full of heart.Peter Jackson’s First World War documentary is a remarkable step-forward for historical filmmaking. The Lord of the Rings director breathes new life into black and white archive footage from the Imperial War Museum, digitally restoring and smoothing the grainy source material before adding colour and sound. The result is a stunning cinematic experience that vividly brings the past into the present. By using the voices of veteran British soldiers interviewed about their experiences in the trenches, Jackson also includes a fascinating narrative that’s both gripping and informative. A wonderfully apt way to mark the centenary of the Great War. Nobody knew if Paul Schrader still had it in him to make a film as angry or as barbed as First Reformed. There is the same raw power here as found in his earlier features about tormented loners. Cinephiles will delight in the (sometimes a little self-conscious) references to Ingmar Bergman and Andrei Tarkovsky, but you can’t help but relish the intensity and intelligence in Ethan Hawke’s performance as the tormented, guilt-ridden priest.There were two Marvel films released this year, one of which – Avengers Infinity War – was an over-crowded, if ambitious, sequel. The other was a landmark film – not just for Marvel, but for cinema. Black Panther was fit to bursting with selling points, all combining to deliver the studio’s best film: Michael B Jordan’s standout villain, scene-stealing performances from Danai Guria and Letitia Wright, plus the direction of Creed’s Ryan Coogler who proved an inspired appointment. Wakanda forever, indeed.Pawel Pawlikowski’s Cold War, shot in the sleekest black and white, is an effortlessly stylish and romantic drama set in a period of political convulsion. It offers everything from Polish folk music to the sultriest Birth of the Cool-style jazz. Pawlikowski includes moments of reckless hedonism alongside scenes of exile and imprisonment. Best of all, the film has a truly wonderful performance from Joanna Kulig as Zula, the free-spirited young folk singer turned femme fatale.There are no two ways about it: Bradley Cooper\u0027s rock star Jackson Mane inviting Ally – a small-town waitress played by Lady Gaga – onto stage to sing her song in front of thousands of his fans is movie magic. Regardless of your stance on the film\u0027s back half and pretty maudlin ending, A Star is Born is an old-fashioned success story with an intensity that brings up the hairs on the back of your neck.Director Chloé Zhao took a gamble casting a real-life family in this modern-day western about a cowboy named Brady Blackburn (Brady Jandreau). It pays off – this an authentic portrait of contemporary rodeo life in South Dakota. From her amateur cast she somehow coaxes performances more memorable than most pros manage in their entire careers. As moving as it is bold, The Rider also offers an all-too-rare female perspective on masculinity. Eight years after Winter’s Bone made a star of Jennifer Lawrence, Leave No Trace – director Debra Granik’s first feature film since then – should rightly make a star of Thomasin McKenzie too. Based on the book My Abandonment by Peter Rook, Leave No Trace is virtually a two-hander between McKenzie and Ben Foster. They play a PTSD-suffering war veteran and his daughter, who live in the forests of Oregon, fending for themselves. Even when the two are arrested and placed in government housing, the film refuses to be anything other than understated and is all the more beguiling for it.1115 5. The Shape of WaterLoneliness can sometimes feel like your soul has been chained to the bottom of the ocean, at other times it can feel like you’re speaking a language no one else understands. Guillermo del Toro beautifully illustrates both these nuances in his Oscar-winning fantasy romance, in which a mute woman (Sally Hawkins) unexpectedly falls for a strange aquatic creature (Doug Jones), the only one who sees her as she truly wants to be seen. Theirs is a love so mystical, so overwhelming, that it can only be communicated through the language of dreams. Lady Bird will always be close to our hearts. There are times when it feels less like a film, more like a hand tracing delicately through memories, of what it felt like to grow up, to say goodbye, and to find one\u0027s own place in the universe. Greta Gerwig’s story of a teenager, played by Saoirse Ronan, desperate to escape her hometown and seek the intellectual haven of the East Coast colleges (“where the culture is”, she argues) may be specific in its layout, but it is universal in its emotions. Whenever Lynne Ramsey attaches her name to a film, you know to expect something special. You Were Never Really Here marks a career-high for the British auteur, who manages to condense the violent story of a former military man searching for a stolen girl into a viciously edited 90-minute thriller. Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda’s Shoplifters could be the year’s most disarming film.

Joaquin Phoenix makes for the perfect enigmatic leading man, while Jonny Greenwood’s mechanical, piercing score adds to the decidedly eerie atmosphere.Should Phantom Thread really be Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film, then the actor can retire knowing that Reynolds Woodcock ranks among his greatest roles. Day-Lewis plays the egomaniacal fashion designer with a childish whimsy, but there\u0027s also a spectral quality to him that looms in every scene. Lesley Manville’s deliciously funny Cyril and Vicky Krieps’s superbly sharp Alma offer two cunning counters to Reynolds’s growing appetite for self-destruction, making for some wonderfully heated confrontations. Paul Thomas Anderson’s direction allows each character to blossom on screen, in a film that makes for a masterful study of poisonous relationships.Loosely based on his own childhood, Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s follow-up to the Oscar-winning Gravity is a gorgeous piece of film-making, a quiet paean to the women who raised him. It\u0027s a neorealist masterpiece, shot in 65mm black and white, and built from detailed vignettes of domestic life in early 1970s Mexico City, a time there of great social unrest. Savour every scene: the camera takes it all in, as we follow a young Mixtec woman named Cleo (wonderful newcomer Yalitza Aparicio) who looks after a well-to-do family she comes to think of as her own. It\u0027s about love, grief and resilience: it will slay you.Avengers: Infinity War was the fourth best selling home entertainment release of the year across digital retail, blu-ray and DVD, followed by Paddington 2.Liz Bales, chief executive of BASE said: “The third consecutive year of growth in the video category underlines the fact that audiences remain engaged with a broad variety of home entertainment content and format options.“This serves as a testament to the innovation and energy that continue to drive the home entertainment category even as the high street retail environment presents clear challenges in some areas.“Today’s customers enjoy a multitude of options when it comes to keeping themselves entertained and clearly continue to find a huge amount of relevance in the video category which, more flexibly than ever before, caters to every need whether that is watching on the go, building a digital library or securing the absolute best viewing experience premium formats now guarantee.“We face into the New Year with a clear desire to build on successes but also to ensure that the degree of choice available remains one of the category’s great strengths.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Clunge. Muffwagon. Goodness, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard those creative expressions of male sexual frustration, and it\u0027s\u0026nbspnice to hear them again, like old friends, or “Fwends” in this case. The Inbetweeners are back. Sort of.Even by the usually self-congratulatory standards of tellyland, the total of four hours and 10 minutes of airtime devoted by Channel 4 to their 2008 hit The Inbetweeners\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspa tad self-indulgent, though it is one of the channel’s recent glories.\u0026nbspHosted, inevitably, by the roughly contemporaneous Jimmy Carr, the first two hours of this teenage marathon, The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, is given over to a sort of mix of This is Your Life, An Audience With..., and Radio 4’s The Reunion. That is followed by four full episodes of the series, mostly for the devotees, I imagine, as well as any stray viewers unfamiliar with this comedic landmark to judge this odyssey of pubic discovery, adolescence and embarrassment at first hand.\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn all, The Inbetweeners ran to three series and two films, predominantly onanistic in tone, and most of the cast and creators turn\u0026nbspup for this celebration of its 10th anniversary. The Fwends Reunited show is dominated, naturally, by the four sixth form virginal idiots a good shag would have probably sorted out, but who, fortunately for us, never got lucky. Simon Bird (as Will McKenzie), Joe Thomas (Simon Cooper), James Buckley (Jay Cartwright) and Blake Harrison (Neil Sutherland) confirm the impression that they were basically playing themselves in The Inbetweeners and haven’t changed much since the last piece was smut was propelled like a flying turd into the public’s consciousness in 2014. I just hope their real-time personas have managed to “plunge some clunge” as they approach early middle age. Not sure, though.Given the vast prairie of time to fill, the producers plunder every known format to maintain some kind of momentum, and mostly to good effect, \u0026nbspthanks to the timeless quality of the original gags. So there is a series of “Awards” for stuff like “best bodily malfunction”, and I for one will never tire of seeing Simon projectile vomiting semi-digested creme de menthe on his girlfriend’s six-year-old brother nor of Simon’s left testicle hanging forlornly from his posing pouch in the school fashion show nor of watching Will tearfully confessing to his teacher that “I thought it was a fart”, as he had to be escorted from the A level exam room. You can almost smell the, er, shame.\u0026nbspThe 10 best TV shows of 2018The Inbetweeners\u0027 James Buckley \u0027could have died\u0027 filming boat scene There is a mini-quiz segment too, featuring Inbetweeners “super fans” whose programme knowledge exceeded that of the cast themselves, with a scholarly textual grasp of lines such as: “What is Swansea. Is it an animal?” “What\u0027s this pesto stuff? Is it for humans?” and “Just cos you’ve had your first puff on your first joint it doesn’t make you Kurt Cobain.”One super fan even had a tattoo of a grinning Jay with the inscription “CLUNGE” garnishing her upper thigh – ironically about as close as Jay ever got to a lady’s bodily treasure.The quiz “prize”, won by a Will lookalike in specs and a blazer, is a bright yellow M-reg Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii Edition, complete with “tape deck” and red passenger door.This runabout is also the co-star of the Fwends show and features in the freshly filmed sequences, such as their nostalgic trip back to Rudge Park Comprehensive\u0026nbsp(, as Carr puts it “in a car none of them owned to a school none of them went to”. Will relives the moment when he shat himself, which is, well, moving.Created with Sketch.Best TV of 2018 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair. Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.The talking (dick) heads are good too, especially when creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris explain the genesis of some of the set pieces, often based on their own life experiences. Beesley, for example, confesses how he had ranted some foul-mouthed sarcastic abuse at some hapless kids for pushing in at an amusement park before bullying his way onto the ride. Smug, he turned to them and only then discovered that the selfish bastards were at the front of the rollercoaster because they had Down syndrome.\u0026nbspGreg Davies’s presence as the bad-tempered teacher Mr Gilbert is also enjoyable. No wonder that Davies went into comedy having himself been a bad-tempered teacher (“a living hell” in his seemingly sincere description). Waen Shepherd (Mr “Paedo” Kennedy) is extremely game to join in the fun –\u0026nbspperhaps surprising given the times we live in. Indeed, I wonder, only a few years on, if phrases such as “spaz” and “rapey” could be scripted now.You could call it a retrospective then, if you were pretentious enough, or “going in balls deep” if you’re Jimmy Carr. Although it lacks a certain pointfulness - the cast are even more absurdly old to play adolescents again and there will \u0026nbspbe no more episodes or movies \u0026nbsp- and all concerned refuse to take itself too seriously, which is just as well. Like a more successful sort of school reunion.\u0026nbspThere’s nothing more tedious than people earnestly trying to deconstruct comedy: much better instead just to get on with the clips and the poo jokes. And so they do, and so does Will get a high speed turd in the face from a water chute, and suddenly we are all back in the sixth form disco again.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off.

This is being immediately rectified.”The government is spending a total of\u0026nbsp£108m on chartering ferries to transport goods and reduce congestion at Dover in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The deal will see two other companies, Danish firm DFDS and French company Brittany Ferries appointed to provide freight services if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal.Seaborne Freight has been instructed to operate\u0026nbspferries from\u0026nbspRamsgate\u0026nbspin Kent to Ostend in Belgium, beginning with two ships in late March and increasing to four by the end of the summer.Support free-thinking journalism and subscribe to Independent MindsThe company said it had been working since\u0026nbsp2017 on reopening a ferry route from Ramsgate, including “locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure – such as bunkering – as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating”.It added: “It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons.“This coincides with the Department for Transport’s\u0026nbspfreight capacity purchase agreement with Seaborne which is part of their preparations to increase ferry capacity in the unlikely event of a no-deal Brexit.But a Conservative councillor for Ramsgate\u0026nbspquestioned the decision to award the contract to the firm.Paul Messenger told the BBC:\u0026nbsp“It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done?“Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them £14m? I don’t understand the logic of that.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereDepartment for TransportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Downing Street declined to comment on Mr Dodds’ comments.Under Ms May’s plan, the backstop comes into play if the UK and EU have failed to reach a deal on future relations by the end of the Brexit transition period.It would keep the whole UK in a customs union with the EU, with Britain only able to leave the arrangement with the mutual agreement of Brussels.Ms May has spent Christmas in talks with EU leaders as she seeks further concessions from Brussels to mitigate displeasure among the DUP and her own MPs at the inclusion of the Irish backstop.Her proposals are set to come back to the House of Commons for a vote in the week beginning January 14, though there have been some suggestion that it could be delayed further.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds\u0026nbspin favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like\u0026nbspJackie Chan and\u0026nbspKelly Osbourne\u0026nbspfor their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses.

The layout of the temple at Tehuacan seems to match that description.\u0026nbspDepictions of the god had been found before in other cultures, including the Aztecs, but not a whole temple.\u0026nbspUniversity of Florida archaeologist Susan Gillespie, who was not involved in the project, wrote that “finding the torso fragment of a human wearing the flayed skin of a sacrificial victim in situ is perhaps the most compelling evidence of the association of this practice and related deity to a particular temple, more so to me than the two sculpted skeletal crania”.\u0026nbsp“If the Aztec sources could be relied upon, a singular temple to this deity (whatever his name in Popoloca) does not necessarily indicate that this was the place of sacrifice,” Ms Gillespie added.“The Aztec practice was to perform the sacrificial death in one or more places, but to ritually store the skins in another, after they had been worn by living humans for some days.“So it could be that this is the temple where they were kept, making it all the more sacred.”\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by APOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Previous spacecraft have seen the far side, but none have landed on it.The landing “lifted the mysterious veil” of the far side of the moon and “opened a new chapter in human lunar exploration”, the agency said in a statement on its website, which included a wide-angle colour picture of a crater from the moon’s surface.The probe, which has a lander and a rover, touched down at a targeted area near the moon’s south pole in the Von Karman Crater after entering the moon’s orbit in mid-December.The tasks of the Chang’e-4 include astronomical observation, surveying the moon’s terrain, landform and mineral makeup, and measuring the neutron radiation and neutral atoms to study the environment of its far side.In a tweet, Nasa’s administrator, Jim Bridenstine, praised China for its “impressive\u0026nbspaccomplishment”.\u0026nbsp“Congratulations to China’s Chang’e-4 team for what appears to be a successful landing on the far side of the Moon. This is a first for humanity and an impressive accomplishment!”The landing is a milestone for China in its race to catch up with Russia and the US and become a major space power by 2030. Beijing plans to launch construction of its own manned space station next year.While China has insisted its ambitions are purely peaceful, the US\u0026nbspDefence Department has accused it of pursuing activities aiming to prevent other nations from using space-based assets during a crisis.Besides its civilian ambitions, China has tested anti-satellite missiles, and the US\u0026nbspCongress has banned Nasa\u0026nbspfrom two-way cooperation with its Chinese counterpart over security concerns.As competition accelerates in space,\u0026nbspDonald Trump seeks to create a new “Space Force” by 2020, as the sixth branch of the military.China lands spacecraft on far side of moon in world firstBut the private space race is also heating up, as numerous companies aim to commercialise space travel, such as California-based SpaceX, which has upended the industry with its low-cost reusable Falcon 9 rockets.The US\u0026nbspis the only country to have landed humans on the moon, and Mr Trump said in 2017 he wanted to return astronauts to the lunar surface to build a foundation for an eventual Mars mission.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrators have said people could be put on Mars by as soon as the mid-2030s, with the agency having landed eight spacecraft there, the most recent in November.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two men walk past a damaged cargo train after an accident in Nyborg, Denmark.

Business and Energy, Culture Media and Sport and Transport - will all be merged to create one new super ministry.A second merger being looked at would also see Department for International Development subsumed back into the Foreign Office.Reducing the overall number of Whitehall ministries by three will slash backroom costs to save hundreds of millions as well as streamline their work to make them more effective, the ministers argue.The project is being championed by Treasury Chief Secretary Liz Truss, who is in talks about it with Theresa May’s de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.It would be implemented at the time of the Government-wide Spending Review in the autumn, to set ministries’ budgets for the next four years.But the plan has not been approved by the PM, who opposes any substantial Whitehall reorganisation as gimmicky and disruptive.One Cabinet minister who backs the move told The Sun: “We need to be really bold to solve the nation’s longterm productivity problem, which means turbo charging everything we’re doing on connectivity.“Money also needs to be found to pay for an uplt in defence and the police, and that can only come from other departments.”The senior minister added: “It’s fair to say we would need a new occupant in No to do this, because the current one doesn’t want to take on the civil service”.Senior Tories have argued for years todevelopment spending to the Foreign Office so it can be used as a better tool of political influence abroad.Britain’s aid cash was under the control of the Foreign Secretary until  when incoming Labour PM Tony Blair created DFID as a separate ministry.A recent report by the Institute for Government revealed setting up new Government departments can incur huge costs.Ministers spent £million creating the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in  and £million setting up the Department for Work and Pensions in the same year.The IfG’S Associate Director Joe Owen said: “Ministry reorganisations are often done for political signalling purposes to reset priorities.“The cost of disruption can be quite signicant in the first few years, as everything needs to change from email addresses to co-locating people.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000459300553.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"durex recalls real feel condoms","story":"The recall, which only affects products in Canada, comes after a specic batch failed the durability test.Thursdays recall follows a similar recall in July, when  batches were pulled from UK shelves.The company said in a statement: There is no immediate safety concern for consumers and only specic batches are affected.We are working closely with Health Canada and have decided to recall affected batches.Health Canada described the recall as precautionary.The organisation said in a statement that the condoms were not expected to meet the registered burst pressure specication at end of shelf-le.Customers are entitled to a refund or exchange on the items.Those who have already used the condoms are not at heightened risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection, the manufacturer said.The batches affected in the most recent recalled are: Durex Real Feel Extra Lubricated ct, batch number , and Durex Real Feel ct, batch number ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000459277356.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"rats infest families estate bins dirty streets","story":"Fuming residents on the Page Hall Estate have compared the squalor to Dickensian England -

There are dead rats all over the estate.The estate has previously hit the headlines over its issue with litter and rats, with horric images showing bins overflowing with rubbish and dead vermin on the streets.Shaun, who has lived on the estate for  years, said: It is just an invite to a feast for them.As well as foxes and other vermin - we even have seagulls in the area feeding on the filth.He continued: It really is like living in Dickensian England.Sheffield City Council said they are carrying out measures to stop the problem - including street wardens who can issue on-the-stop £ fines for fly-tipping.A spokesperson said: Environmental Services Pest Control inspectors have visited a number of properties in the area in the last two weeks and have instructed pest control officers to lay treatments where required.We are educating residents to make sure they dont leave waste in the street, and our Waste Management team is ensuring residents use their domestic bins correctly.Some residents are not reporting problems to us at the earliest opportunity so we would encourage anyone seeing rats or other pest issues in the area to contact us on  ."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000459006641.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sajid javid power gone to his head","story":"The Home Secretary now openly refers to himself by the third person moniker during talks with fellow ministers.Two Cabinet sources confirmed hearing the  year old use the expression recently.One told The Sun: “He uses phrases like, ‘Just you watch what The Sajid is going to do about this’, or ‘The Saj will sort that out’. “It’s bizarre.

The EU will be guided through its many problems by a basket-case country with a pygmy economy, most of whose citizens are desperate to get the hell out and reach the UK.Every time you might doubt we did the right thing in voting to leave, the EU comes up with another brilliant reason not to stay in.Romania, with its beleaguered government and wealth per person lower than Trinidad  Tobago and Kazakhstan. That’s who will be running the show.Right now, though, we have to get our act together. In the middle of this month there will be a debate in Parliament about Theresa May’s “new” deal for us to leave the EU.Government ministers have been whispering that May has won some concessions from the EU negotiating team. I hope so. But I kind of have my doubts.As Lord Sugar might put it, she couldn’t sell prosecco to a hen party. But it’s time to get behind her. Time, too, for arch-Brexiteers to cease being so self-indulgent and vote through a deal that is the least-worst option.Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan ­— a dog’s dinnerever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all.But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit.And waiting in the wingsthe Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party.Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want.But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise.The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority.And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were ided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers.Sothis isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.Our negotiations with the EU should have been done with confidence and self-discipline.Instead, we were always on the back foot because of Conservative in-fighting.Now it’s time to get serious, at long last. Becausewe don’t push this deal through, we may not get Brexit at all.MY wish for the New Year is that someone might tell me what Kendall Jenner, Rita Ora and Ferne McCann actually do for a living. Other than this kinda thing.That’s wish No. Wish No is that Gary Lineker takes a self-awareness course and discovers he’s a bumptious t***er who knows next to nowt.Most of my social-media friends went to bed at pm to avoid seeing London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s ludicrous fireworks display.And all the downstairs lights were off in the houses in my street.Are people getting bored with New Year’s Eve, do you reckon Our Foreign Secretary has just landed in Singapore to drum up more trade for Britain post Brexit.This tiny country – just a city state – is a major economic force and an important ally.It’s also a good lesson for those whining lefties who blame colonialism for the desperate plight of Africa.Singapore was founded as a British trading post exactly  years ago. It was under British control until .It has a booming economy, one of the world’s highest le expectancies and a top standard of living.So it’s not done too badly, has it The truth is colonialism is NOTHING to do with the failure of African countries. It’s about good government.Theres going to be a gay bar in EastEnders.This is an innovation dreamed up by the new script editor, Kate Oates.It’s intended to make the programme more closely represent the area in which it’s set.Ha! Here’s a tip, Ms Oates. If you want EastEnders to truly reflect the borough in which it’s set – Tower Hamlets – you need a few more sweeping changes.Fewer than a third of Tower Hamlets’ residents are white British, so that’s most of the cast gone.Almost  per cent of the people there are Bangladeshi, so the programme should be broadcast in Bengali, not English.Come on, Kate. You want EastEnders to be more real Then make it REALLY real.Lets be honest. It’s not just whichever oaf parked Paul Pogba’s car in that disabled bay who is doing it.When I go to my local supermarket, all the disabled bays are full, every time.No stickers in the car windows.And the people inside the store don’t seem to be limping very much. Sometimes I fantasise about waiting by their cars, with a hammer, for them to emerge with their shopping.“Disabled, huh  Well, you are now.”But one of the problems, I think, is that we have too many disabled bays.And so people don’t take them seriously.Quite clearly, the French are doing nothing whatsoever to deter them.It wouldn’t surprise methey were actually herding them on to the dinghies.“Go on, monsieur, you can see the clfs over there. It’s not far. Bon voyage, mon ami.”It’s another two fingers from the hopeless French because we’re leaving the European Union.What we should be doing is towing the migrants all the way back to Calais.I know living in France is probably a “cruel and unusual punishment” under United Nations laws. But it’s time the French took their responsibilities a bit more seriously.Another year dawns with something  to be terried about.Evil Chinese mussels have invaded British waters, apparently. They smother our decent, God-fearing British scallops and oysters.By the time you read this, they will probably have made their way up the Thames.It’s time we took a stand against these vile, bivalved b******s.Leave our oysters alone, you Commies!

Indeed, anybody who really understands how negotiations work understands that time is our friend.He warned that No Deal would hit Brussels hard, adding: This is the moment to be hardnosed about these issues.The more we prepare to leave the EU without a deal, the more likely a good deal becomes.Mr Davis, who quit the Cabinet in July, suggested that in the worst-case scenario Britain could quickly negotiate a free-trade deal with the EU after leaving in March on World Trade Organisation terms.The DUP also spoke out against the current deal despite being invited to No for lunch with Mrs May.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds blasted that the withdrawal agreement flies in the face of the Governments commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.He added: We will have further discussions with the Prime Minister and will continue to work with the Government in the interests of getting a better deal.Education Secretary Damian Hinds today insisted there are no plans for a further delay, saying: Were going to have this meaningful vote.And the EU pushed back, claiming there is no more time available for further talks.A spokesman for chief Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker said: We have said many times that the deal on the table is the best and only deal possible.Heres how she could see her deal collapse at almost any minute - and may face a struggle to stay in power evenshe does score an unlikely Brexit win.VOTE DANGER: MPs will finally vote on the PMs Brexit deal on January  or .Dozens of Tories and moderate Labour figures have previously pledged to oppose it - meaning there is a serious danger the deal will fall.If that happens, Mrs May will have to go back to the drawing board - with just ten weeks to go before Brexit.NO DEAL DRAMA: If the Commons doesnt approve a withdrawal agreement, Britain will be on course to leave the EU without a deal.Legally speaking, the UK will quit the bloc on March  whether or not there is a deal.The PM and most ministers are convinced that a No Deal outcome would plunge Britain into damaging chaos - although Brexiteers insist the country could thrive by trading on WTO terms.REFERENDUM RE-RUN: If Britain is heading towards No Deal, the Commons is likely to try and stop it.MPs from across the parties would team up to try and force a second referendum which could overturn Brexit altogether.If Parliament does vote for a repeat of the  referendum, Mrs May will come under intense pressure to hold one despite having previously ruled it out.ELECTION THREAT: If the PM does succeed in forcing her deal through the Commons, shell face a new threat from her DUP allies.They have vowed to oppose the Government in a vote of confidencethe withdrawal agreement is passed in its current form.That means Jeremy Corbyn could bring down the Tories and trigger a snap election any moment by tabling a formal no-confidence motion.TOPPLING TORIES: Mrs May held on to her job last month by vowing to quit before the next General Election, due in .But after  MPs voted for her to be kicked out, the PM could face demands to quit earlier than that.Leadership contenders such as Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are already jostling for position in hte race to replace her.For now, no further meetings are foreseen between the Commission’s negotiators and UK negotiators as negotiations have now, indeed, been concluded.“President Juncker is, of course, always available to listen to Prime Minister May’s views in terms of the temporary nature of the backstop.In December Mrs May pulled the Commons vote with just  hours notice, admitting that MPs would defeat it because they worry the backstop could leave Britain tied to the EU permanently.She is adamant she will secure a concession from Brussels which would ensure the backstop is only temporary.Today leading Remainer Chris Leslie claimed MPs would stop ministers claiming their wagesthey refused to call a second referendum on Brexit.The ex-Shadow Chancellor told the Evening Standard: If ministers show contempt for Commons resolutions, MPs should simply refuse to supply the money to pay all ministerial salaries.“And that would be just the start.

Its time to for us to discuss Chris Grayling. A man with the body of Donald Trump and the IQ of a roll of Sellotape, seeing him in a hi-vis jacket is as much reason to despair as spotting lumps in the groin: a sure sign that something is amiss.From Carillion to the criminal justice system, from the welfare state to the prison service, and to Gatwick Airport by way of London Bridge, theres nothing Grayling has touched and not cocked up.And now, despite a long history of incompetence and twattery, he has decided to ring in the New Year the same way he ended the last one. Doing stupid things stupidly, and spitting out another stream of sticky stuff in a vain attempt to hold all the stupid bits together long enough for something even more stupid to happen. In his two years as Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions he helped sacked , JobCentre staff, meaning they all had to go to, well, the JobCentre. Which was shut. When he was put in charge of the poundbn Back to Work programme getting the long-term unemployed into jobs, he was told they were genuinely sicker than expected. His response was to tighten the criteria, making their illnesses bureaucratically unnoticeable, and arguably, it must be said, making them sicker.He was called the worst Lord Chancellor since . He tried to charge defendants to plead not guilty, forcing the poor to admit crimes they may not have committed. He slashed legal aid for domestic abuse victims and banned books for prisoners. It was all deeply stupid, and very horrible. And as person in charge of the legal system, he tried to restrict the legal systems ability to scrutinise politicians. And throughout it all, he yanked a never-ending stream of sticky tape out of his mouth to bundle it all up in one big, sticky mess. As Shadow Home Secretary he was found to have used dodgy and misleading statistics on violent crime, claiming it had risen under Labour when, er, it hadnt. He claimed Moss Side was in the grip of an urban war like that of The Wire. It was left to the Manchester Evening News to point out Baltimore had  gun murders the previous year, while the Mancs suffered the grand total of zero.I pay the same train fares as you! he squeaked this time last year, failing to mention that unlike the rest of us he had a salary of pound, from the public purse, could claim his train fares on expenses, and in any case had the use of a ministerial car. All of which, you would think, would be enough to convince anyone that the best use for Chris Grayling would be as ballast in the foundations of a motorway flyover, rather than the complicated job of handing out big-money government contracts. Instead he was made Transport Secretary, a job he has truly made his own in that he has curled one out on everything thats crossed his desk.In July , now-notorious firm Carillion issued a profit warning that saw its market value drop by poundm. A week later Grayling gave it a pound.bn contract to build tunnels for HS.Grayling claimed he had secure undertakings the contract would be delivered. At the time, there was a poundm hole in Carillions books and it was  months from liquidation. Last month a drone closed Britains second-busiest airport, stranded , passengers a week before Christmas, and cost millions. CSI Gatwick was reduced to standing in fields staring at the sky, and Grayling was offered the services of a crack RAF team of specialists to find the culprit.Its been reported Grayling quibbled for  hours because his department would have to pay for it. By the time the experts were finally called, the drone and its operator had all but disappeared and the governments costs were sky-high. Now, for the second year in a row, he has marked the New Year rail fares increase by disappearing to Qatar on what is claimed to be a post-Brexit trade mission. Why he has tohaving done the same last January, and why it is always arranged during the most indefensible thing he would otherwise have to defend, is not clear. But at the same time, fairly obvious.  All of this could have been predicted some years ago,anyone had noted his , pre-politics job as business development manager for a short-lived experiment called BBC Select. It was an overnight service aimed at professionals who, it was envisioned, would record educational programmes on their VCRs .All well and good, except the business plan young Grayling was tasked with developing involved charging a subscription for it - despite the fact that the BBC, rather famously, is already paid for by everyone with a television.Unsurprisingly, BBC Select closed after  years. More astonishingly though, Grayling was elevated to the lofty position of borough councillor, MP, shadow minister, the Privy Council and then some of the most important offices in the land.  The question is not why he does the stupid things he does, but why anyone lets him play with this stuff. Either he has found something to blackmail Theresa May with, or shes using him to destroy the country so that Brexit doesnt seem so bad. But raise your head from the desk for there are two reasons to hope that the cold, stupid hands of Oh Christ Not Grayling may soon be removed from the tender neck of the British state.The first is that he has awarded a poundm contract for a vital post-Brexit shipping service to a firm that has no ships. This is standard Grayling stupidity, buta deeper scandal is uncovered he might, finally, have his ministerial career terminated. The second is that we may be getting to the end of that roll of Sellotape. Tackled about his avoidance of the train fares rise, Grayling uttered the truest words he has ever spoken: My presence in the country doesnt make any dference. Hes wrong, of course. His presence only makes things worse. Buteven HE realises hes not helping, perhaps one day soon he will do the decent thing and scuttle back to whichever village will have him."},{"url":null,"title":"esa benefits technical glitch means","story":"NewsESA benefits technical glitch means some people are getting their money earlyEmployment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimantsShare and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" and Jobseekers Allowance payments have been unexpectedly split for an unknown number of claimants\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _JS.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"CommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe error has paid out both sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA suspected technical glitch in the benefits system means families across the country have been getting some of their money early. The error has paid out both sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowanceand Jobseekers Allowance to people across the country. Usually, both those benefits are paid in one lump sum fortnightly. But many claimants who were due to be paid next week have received half their payment already. The Department for Work and Pensionsattempted to calm fears today by insisting everyone will get the second half of their payment on the correct day.  It is understood the glitch extends to an unknown number of benefit claimants spread throughout all regions of the UK, including Northern Ireland. One claimant tweeted: Id hoped Theresa May had decided we should get an Xmas bonus! Another complained the payment came with no explanation, no solution, no help. Guidance on the DWPs website confirms: If your ESA payment is due in the week starting  January , you might be paid half of it early in the week starting  December . The other half of your payment will be paid on the correct day. Your next fortnightly ESA payment will be paid as normal.

A DWP spokesperson said: “Some ESA claimants may have received an early half of their fortnightly payment. These claimants will now receive the second half of their payment on their usual pay date. “No one has lost out and all ESA claimants will be paid on time. “Staff are available to offer guidance for those seeking further support.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa mays double brexit blow","story":"NewsTheresa Mays double Brexit blow as DUP and Irish PM line up to trash her dealThe DUPs Nigel Dodds dashed Downing Streets hopes of a breakthrough - and Irish PM Leo Varadkar piled on the painShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor:,  JAN NewsThe DUPs Nigel Dodds \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEmbattled Theresa May’s hopes of winning support for her Brexit plan were dashed over lunch with the DUP tonight. The Prime Minister’s bid to shore-up backing for her Brussels pact was looking increasingly fruitless after she hosted the party’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds in No. Downing Street had hoped for a breakthrough, but he emerged saying: “The withdrawal agreement, as currently proposed, flies in the face of the government’s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU.” EU leaders crushed chances of offering Mrs May concessions to win over the DUP and her own backbenchers. She wants reassurances the Irish backstop - designed to prevent checks on the -mile frontier between the North and the Republic under a no-deal departure - will not be indefinite.  Torpedoing the bid, EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s spokeswoman said: “We are not renegotiating what is on the table. “Our solutions are on the table, we are ready to listen but at this stage there are no further meetings and the EU  leaders have been very clear that it will not be renegotiated what is on the table.” Mr Juncker “reiterated very clearly that we have put all the solutions on the table and now it is up the British people and MPs to decide on the next steps”, in an interview last month, she added. Meanwhile, speaking after talks with German counterpart Angela Merkel, Irish PM Leo Varadkar piled the pain on Mrs May. He said: “We’re happy to offer reassurances and guarantees to the UK, but not reassurances and guarantees that contradict or change what was agreed back in November.”  Admitting he had “given up speculating at this stage” on potential Brexit outcomes, he said it was a problem triggered by the UK. “We’re really looking to them for a solution,” he said. “It’s up to them to make a proposal but it has to be a proposal that we can accept. “It can’t be a proposal that contradicts what’s already in the withdrawal agreement. “It can’t be something that renders the backstop inoperable.” Mr Dodds warned his party would not support the current plan. He said: “The backstop is not the best of both worlds. “It is potentially indefinite in time, would place a barrier between us and our main trading partner in Great Britain and give enormous leverage to the EU in negotiations on the future relationship with the UK. “We will have further discussions with the Prime Minister and will continue to work with the government is interests of getting a better deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"what its like live 60","story":"NewsWhat its like to live on £ a week under the governments miners pension schemeMore than £.billion has been taken out of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme - while former colliers live on as little as £ a week.

This is the situation thousands of former miners and colliers found themselves in when, after years of back-breaking work, they were finally able to retire. Now three former colliers have spoken of the reality of living on as little as pound per week from the miners pension scheme in moving testimony, originally published by WalesOnline. In recent years the terms of the Mineworkers Pension Scheme have come under growing criticism by those who were working underground when it was decided in . Since then the government have taken more than pound. billion in surpluses out of the same pot - and will take pound million more over the next three years. Unbeknown to many, the situation with the Mineworkers Pension Scheme began  years ago when British Coal was privatised.  At the time, ministers agreed the Government would act as guarantor for two pension schemes - The Mineworkers Pension Scheme, boasting , members, and the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme, with , members. Under the deal, any surplus money gained from the scheme would be split   between the Treasury and scheme members. But, while it was estimated the funds would generate a pound billion surplus over  years, it has done better than expected. In November, energy minister Claire Perry revealed pound million had been taken by the Treasury in  alone. In total, the Mineworker Pension Fight claims the amount taken by the Government has reached pound billion in just over  years - while former workers receive an average pension of pound a week. At -years-old Emlyn Davies lives with his daughter and her husband. He is one of the surviving , former miners who paid .% into the scheme while working.  While the decision was made after his we Gwynneths death in , the pensioner claims he would not be able to afford to live on his own. This is because, after  years working in Penrhiwceiber Colliery he now receives pound a week. I receive pound a week. Imagine playing pound or pound a week in and you only have pound back after  years , Emlyn, known to family and friends as Em, said. When I was a young man - I started in the s - we thought we would have a good pension. Then they altered it and I thought it would be even better but it ended up not being the case. We are still poor. At -years-old, Em followed the footsteps of his father and two older brothers to begin a career in the colliery. Originally a worker on the coal face, he later moved to work with the power loading machinery. As a working father-of-five le was hard - but there were plenty of happy times. He said: When the kids were very young I was still in the pit and we had everything they wanted for Christmas.  We used to go in debt for six months after to back out of it. Thats why our family are so close - we gave them everything and they seem to share that. It wasnt a lot but we lived day to day. However, for the grandfather-of- and great-grandfather-of-, things changed once he hit retirement age. He said: After I retired all together it was a struggle. We couldnt live on the money we were given, every year we would go to the bank and borrow pound, with interest and everything. Thats why we decided to sell the house and move into council rented accommodation. We lost our house - we had to sell it because we couldnt afford the repairs. Now Ive got a good family around me and my daughter and her husband have taken me on. After I lost my we I took it badly. ButI was living on my own now I wouldnt be able to survive. At -years-old, former Oakdale colliery worker Ken Sullivan took the decision to retire after undergoing triple bypass surgery. His career in the colliery also started at the age of  when he began to support his father who was a prisoner of war during World War Two. Now, he receives pound a week from the scheme, alongside his state pension. Ken, who has lived in the same house in Tredegar since he was born, said: People think it is a good amount but when you contemplate what you have paid in its not that much. My we budgets everything down to the last penny. Theres only certain things we can buy and certain things we cant but you get used to it. We dont go out - my we last went out three years ago. For the -year-old, the hardest part is not being able to take his whole family on holiday each year. He said: With Christmas we make sure we have a good time and are not going without but there are one or two extra things we cant get. Im only getting half the pension I should - an extra pound would make a huge dference. For Ken, reality hit home this winter home while watching BBC drama Care - which charted the dficulties of a woman who develops dementia after a stroke. Ken said: Its frightening to think what could become of you. Before we get to that stage it would be nice to enjoy le without worrying about every penny. Two years ago, the father and grandfather began a petition calling for the scheme to be reviewed. It now has more than , signatures. As part of his campaigning, Ken has visited every village and town in South Wales drumming up support - and has met those in situations far worse than his own. He said: In Abertillery there was an old lady and she was told she would get pound. a week as a widower. Her husband would have got pound a week. She was gutted and thought the pension was disgusting but accepted what she had. A lot of people dont realise what has taken place. What we are asking for is the pension we have paid into. We are not asking for charity, we are not asking for hand-outs, thats all we want. Between  and , Gareth Davies also worked at Oakdale Colliery. Gareth, , is thankful his situation is better than most thanks to his pound-a-month pension - arranged due to his position as collier official. Gareth, who now lives in Aberdare, said: I receive pound a month but there are many more that are on a lot less. I have heard many many sad stories, there are people that havent got a penny. I have spoken to people that have teared-up speaking about it. Ive recently separated from my we so Im living on my own and Ive got debts to pay off so its not easy. He added: The government took over our pension scheme under dubious circumstances. The ones worst off are those that left school at  and expected to retire at . Their funds have been used by the government to pay out the banks. A Government spokesman said: “The Mineworkers’ Pensions Scheme is subject to a Government Guarantee which ensures that a member’s pension, including inflation increases, will always be paid. “Members have received pensions approximately % larger than would have been the case without the Guarantee.” "},{"url":null,"title":"big families latest list must","story":"NewsBig families are latest A-List must-have - how do likes of Tana Ramsay do it EXCLUSIVE: Its wonderful news Tana Ramsay is expecting her fth child at the age of  - but most people would struggle to cope the way celebrities do with their big broodsShareCommentsByJulie McCaffrey:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsThe ever-growing Ramsay family \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTana Ramsay excitedly shyannouncing her pregnancy is the big showbiz news of the New Year.

Soon he’ll join the super-exclusive celebrity club or shysuper-families, where membership only requires a big clan. Eddie Murphy, , was this week pictured with his  kids ranging from three weeks to . Mel Gibson, , has nine shychildren. Angelina Jolie, , and Madonna, , each have six. Jamie, , and Jools, , have five children: Poppy, , Daisy, , Petal, nine, Buddy, eight, and two-year-old River. Jamie hired a night nurse when baby River came along. He said: “Sleep deprivation makes the most wonderful people just, unreasonable. “It’s really, really hard whether it’s your first or your fth. It hit us hard this year, really hard, because you know we’ve got two teenagers and it’s teenagers things, and you’ve got a six and a seven-year-old as well, and they’re up as well, I mean it was hard this time round.” “For the first time ever I’ve got a night nurse.”  Looking after three ones under the age of five has been such a breeze for Kim Kardashian, , she and Kanye, , are having a fourth. Abbey Clancy, , and footballer Peter Crouch, , are also expecting a fourth because “a hat-trick just won’t do”. Coleen and Wayne Rooney welcomed their fourth son two years ago, while Katie Price says she would like to add to her gaggle of five. Angelina, , hired one nanny each for each of her six children Maddox, , Pax, , Zahara, , Shiloh, , and ten-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne. Recently she fired her brother from the role as head nanny and hired two further nannies. Home le still sounds chaotic, with one former nanny saying: “In the middle of the night they’re running down the hallway waking their parents up and trying to get into their beds.”  So is a big brood the ultimate celebrity status symbol  Why  Is it that so many celebrity dads are alpha males, driven by competitiveness  Are some mothers simply in love with the feeling of being “mum”  Andyou adore the unconditional love of a baby in the cold world of showbiz, why not have another... and another... and another  Or is it because only healthy couples with meticulously organised lives can cope with the chaose of having so many little monsters.

Victoria said she had five members of staff including a nanny, housekeeper and a chef to help run her house smoothly.  Even Jamie Oliver couldn’t help getting involved when he spoke of having more children than fellow chef Gordon. It sparked a long-running feud between the two. “Boys will always fight and butt heads but Tana was mortied. I mean really mortied,” Gordon said.

My mum and dad did everything for me and my brother and sister and I want the same for my kids.”  Pictures of his six pack and her perfect outfits have become the norm. It’s posts of Victoria baking unicorn biscuits with daughter Harper that leaves us saying, ‘How on earth does she do it ’. The more children, the greater our admiration. If you’ve heard of Helena Morrissey, it’s probably not because of the -year-old’s role as head of personal investing at Legal  General but because of her nine children.

But the pairs plans were dashed after the Gambling Commission declared that it was not a legal prize competition. The couple were also hoping to raise up to pound, for Cancer Research during the sale of their home in Grosmont, North Yorkshire. The winner was due to be drawn on Thursday, but Mr and Mrs Smith said they are back to square one after being told by the Gambling Commission that it was not a legal prize competition.   In a post on the website set up by the couple to administer the competition, they said: It is with sincere regret and upset that this competition has to close. The Gambling Commission has deemed the competition a potential lottery and not a legal prize competition. We understand the disappointment to you all and can only apologise sincerely as well as offer a full refund.

Mrs Smith battled cancer  years ago and the couple also lost their daughter three years ago. Her husband said on the website: As you will have seen, my we and I have been through a lot over the last three years and it was hoped that this would give us the break we need.Unfortunately, we are back to square one. The couple said the decision by the commission was contrary to the legal advice they had been given. They said the house is open to offers in the normal way and ticket refunds can be claimed through the website.  The Gambling Commission said it could not comment on specic cases but a spokesman said: The commission has duties to prevent illegal gambling. This includes identying when promotions described as competitions or free prize draws are in fact lotteries which should be properly licensed. In regulating lotteries we work to protect the funds that go to a range of good causes such as charities, hospices, air-ambulance services or other not-for-profit causes, all of which heavily rely on income from lotteries to support their work. The commission will act where schemes are organised and promoted that amount to unlicensed and illegal gambling.

One lorry driver has seen his fair share of reckless behaviour over the years, but couldnt believe his eyes when he saw what one cyclist did right in front of him. HGV driver Richard Hook, , watched in horror as a man riding a bike with a small child sitting on the back, decided to overtake a lorry on a roundabout.  Richards dashcam captured the shocking incident which occurred in Weybridge, Surrey. The footage begins with Richard, from Winchester, driving down Church Street in Weybridge. He comes to a halt at a roundabout, just as another lorry begins approaching from the other direction. A loud horn can be heard in the video, as a cyclists darts out in front of the lorry and across the roundabout.  Richard begins shouting at the cyclist - who isnt wearing a helmet and has a young child sat on the back of his bike. Thankfully the child does have a helmet on. The lorry driver proceeds to share his shock through a series of expletives: F*** me! F***ing hell! He adds: Got a bit shaken up there.  The cyclist continues over the roundabout without stopping and then heads onto Balfour Road. Richard recently uploaded the clip to a Facebook dashcam group, where it has since been viewed hundreds of times. He captioned the video, saying: Dad of the year, apologies in advance for bad language. Outraged by the footage, many people took the time to comment and share their thoughts on the cyclist.  One person wrote: Okyoure a cyclist and have no regard for your own le. Do not have the same opinion for your childs. Another posted: Holy c***! Gamble with his own lehe wants, but not the kid too! A third added: I hope the boys mother sees the video! Cannot believe he rides like that with a child on the back. Well done lorry driver. Could well of been a double fatality. Richard later revealed that the footage was actually taken in , but hed decided to share it with the public to raise awareness. He explained: As a professional driver you see this sort of thing all the time so was not surprised. You learn to look out for these idiots. The child on the back just makes it horric.

Lewis Ludlow, , wrote out plans to kill more than  people in the sophisticated terror plot. The former postman, from Rochester, Kent, referred to himself as The Eagle or The Ghost during his trial. The Old Bailey heard he researched van hire to carry out the lone wolf ram attack and had sent a contact in the Philippines a chilling, handwritten oath of allegiance to Islamic State. Torn up notes recovered from Ludlows home detailed an attack on Oxford Street using a van to mount the pavement, noting the lack of safety barriers. But today Ludlow faces years in prison after he admitted funding and preparing acts of terrorism.  He denied a further charge of attempting to travel to join Islamic State but this was ordered to lie on file. Mark Heywood, prosecuting, said Ludlow associated with terrorists like Abu Izzadeen - real name Trevor Brooks - who is associated with the radical Islamist group al-Muhajiroun. He added: As of the year , he had a signicant interest in jihadist ideas and was associating very closely with those most involved with that proscribed organisation. Beyond his associations, he was interested in travel to Syria, and was supportive of Daesh, that is Islamic State. Ludlows phone was full of Islamic State material including images of the Islamic flag, stills from the video of caged Jordanian pilots who were executed and films of beheadings.  The former Royal Mail postie had bought a phone under a  name and used aliases like AliHussain to communicate with jihadist associates on encrypted messaging sites like Kik. In June , he wrote to associate Junaid Hussain about how he was planning hijrah in a few months to sha allah or migration to Islamic State. He wrote to Hussain: at my job at a Royal Mail warehouse we had a book that mentions to staff look out for suspicious items like bombs Im thinking I find out more. Police had visited Ludlows home a number of times, as far back as November  to discuss his colleges concerns about his religious beliefs. But after counter terrorist officers were alerted to Mr Ludlows ideology, he failed to engage with the Prevent police programme, aimed to help those at risk of becoming a terrorist. These attempts included meetings with a Home Office approved mentor and community mentoring with Medway youth workers, which Ludlow often failed to turn up to from  until the core events in March .  Police surveillance began in October  and in January he was shown to purchase aticket to Manila in the Philippines, with the aim of travelling on Mindanao and Zamboanga city, known locations of terrorist activity. He bought flight tickets to Zamboanga via Manila in the Phillippines on  January and travelled to Heathrow on  February where he was stopped under Schedule  of the Terrorism Act before boarding the flight and his passport was seized.Mr Heywood told the court: Ludlow planned to remain in the Philippines indefinitely and theticket was likely bought to avoid suspicion.When interviewed he claimed he was travelling to engage in sexual tourism.Ludlow was arrested on  April this year, and he was charged on  April with preparation of terrorist acts. Rebecca Trowler, defending, has claimed his offending could be explained by his autism.

The adventurous four-year-old would probably try to tackle the slide in Winter Wonderland on his own but both his legs were amputated after he was abused by his birth parents when he was just weeks old. His birth parents were later jailed thanks to the tireless work of Tonys adoptive parents, Paula and Mark Hudgell, who pushed to have them prosecuted after the Crown Prosecution Serviceinitially dropped the case.  The family of  took a trip to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, London, to celebrate the New Year. Paula said: Winter Wonderland was magical. Tony particularly loved the Ice Kingdom which was like walking into a giant freezer with lots of ice sculptures everywhere. He went down the ice slide on his brothers, Jaden and Henrys, laps. And his face lit up when he watched Peter Pan on Ice which he loved. He was sitting right at the front.  Four years ago, little Tonys le was effectively saved by Christmas. The baby was admitted to hospital with multiple organ failure, numerous fractures and sepsis. After a six week battle to save him, doctors made the dficult decision just before Christmas, , to withdraw all but palliative care. But in an extraordinary twist of fate, doctors were unable to stop treatment because Tony was a ward of court – and the courts had closed for Christmas. Those few days gave him the chance to fight for his le and he amazed doctors by rallying. Weeks later, he was fostered by the Hudgells and his le took a dramatic turn for the better.  Now Christmas is an extra-special time for the whole family. Paula said: Tony was so excited for Christmas. He said it was his best day ever. He loved it all. Santa brought him lots of presents and he loved being with the whole family. Now having celebrated a wonderful Christmas together Paula has said that her New Year resolution is to continue to fight for vulnerable children and to build more protection for children into British law. The resolute mum-of-eight from Kent started a petition calling for tougher sentences for child cruelty and quickly collected more than , signatures of support. Her MP, Tom Tugendhat, will present the petition to the House of Commons on January, , and together they hope to change the law in baby Tonys name.  Paula said: This year I will continue to fight for all children until we get tougher sentences for anyone who hurts them. Increased sentences will make no dference to Tony now but hopefully it will help future children.  Too many children are abused and neglected and something needs to be done to stop that. Despite Tonys horric start in le, he has been thriving under the Hudgells care, changing from a broken little boy to a confident, smiling child with big brown eyes that just melt your heart, Paula, , said.  Nothing stops him now. Hes really fast getting around and hes caught up cognitively with all his peers. He is a very determined little boy.”  Paula added: He has been through so much but hes such a wonderful little boy. He shows that all so many children need is a little bit of love and care. Now my children say Tony is their inspiration, their hero. Tony has changed us all. I would never have had the confidence before to push parliament to change the law before.

Tanya Evans, , was living in agony for years after the mysterious growth appeared out of the blue one day in . However she postponed surgery while she desperately tried for a baby with her fiance Mark Jenkins, . Just as she was giving up hope Tanya fell pregnant with Josie, who was born in December . Since then she has had a major operation in April  to remove the bowel - which was pushing through her abdominal wall causing the hernia. Her rectum and anus had also been irreparably damaged following a prolapse and she is still battling with daily pain.  Tanya, of Swansea, South Wales, said: “I still struggle every day, with the simplest of tasks. “Mark has to help me shower and I can barely lt anything. That means I can’t pick Josie up for a cuddle, which is heartbreaking. “She’s too young to understand, so she thinks it’s because she’s been naughty. The physical side of things has been hard, but the mental has been absolute torture.” Tanyas nightmare began back in , when she was raced to hospital with a severe bowel obstruction. Gravely ill, her skin turned yellow and she even vomited up faeces. She explained: “I was vomiting up something black, which tasted disgusting. Medics tested it and told me it was faeces. I was absolutely terried.”  Forced to have an ileostomy, where the small bowel, or intestine, is erted through an opening in the abdomen, Tanya was left with a stoma bag. Its designed to collect waste that would ordinarily be passing through the large intestine and out of the body. Despite a few weeks of colic – abdominal pain – she felt relatively well, and was hopeful she would make a full recovery. But one day later in , a hernia appeared. According to the NHS,it occurs when an internal part of the body, in Tanya’s case her bowel, pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding wall. She said: “I had it checked over, and confirmed as a hernia. At first, I was reassured it could be easily sorted out – but then, I also began to bleed from my bottom.” Further investigations revealed that Tanya was suffering from ersion colitis, and inflammation of the colon, which can occur as a complication of surgery.  Given pain medication as well as steroid enemas to calm the inflammation, she faced another knockback when she realised that surgery to remove the growth could cause fertility issues. Doctors warned that,the womb was affected too, a hysterectomy may be necessary. With a waiting list for the procedure anyway, doctors agreed she should take the chance to try for a baby while she could. “Mark and I tried and tried and I cried at every negative test,” she said. “I started to fear it would never happen for us, but then, we conceived. “Josie was born on December ,  three weeks early, weighing lb oz. She had to be delivered via caesarean, due to the hernia, but she was happy and healthy.” After recovering from childbirth, Tanya met with a team of medics, and her surgery was pencilled in for August . She continued: “But then August came and went, then September, then October. I was told there were no beds available, which I understand happens, but what was I supposed to do  I felt like I was dying. “Then, at the end of the year, I discovered the surgeon who was meant to be doing my operation was retiring, so no longer available. I was terried I’d be back at square one, on another wait list to see another doctor.  “I contacted the patient liaison department and they kept asking what they could do to help. But all anyone could do was wait for a cancellation to come up. So, I fought and fought.” As she waited, Tanya’s hernia continued to grow, eventually reaching lb. She added: “It affected everything I did, and put so much pressure on my body. Sitting down hurt, standing up hurt – everything. “It even bruised my legs where it’d bang against my thigh. At its worst, it would twist and strangulate, where the blood supply to the intestines and abdominal tissues gets cut off.” Eventually, in April , Tanya went under the kne. Though she did not have a hysterectomy, surgeons did remove her bowel, rectum and anus, which had been damaged by a prolapse – where organs fall down, or slip out of place. Adding that, since the hernia was removed, she has gone from a size  to a , she continued: “Apparently, where the strangulated hernia had cut off the blood supply, my bowel was just completely dead, and the tissue was virtually disintegrated.  “Once they saw the damage that’d been going on inside, medics couldn’t believe I’d been walking around. “It’s not that I have a high pain threshold, though. I’ve just become used to the pain, which is very sad.” When she first came round, Tanya admitted she could not bear to look at her scar, which she said resembled a shark bite. Now, still wearing a bag attached to her stoma to collect waste, she is hoping to also have tummy tuck surgery to remove the baggy skin where it was stretched over the hernia. With a hysterectomy still a consideration in the future, depending on how her regular check ups go, she said: “When people hear tummy tuck, they assume it’s because I want to look good.But it’s actually because I have been left with saggy skin, that can hang down and make my bag leak. “Le is very dferent for me now. I have to be incredibly careful just moving around, as one awkward fall could split my stitching and hospitalise me. I still sit on an air cushion every day, too, as sitting down without is simply too painful. “I don’t want anybody  to go through this, so I am urging others out there to keep pushing and fighting for helpthey need it.”  Jo Davies, Assistant Service Group Manager, Surgical Specialties for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which covers Swansea, said: In line with other health boards in Wales, we continue to experience signicant challenges in providing routine urgent elective surgery.We are taking ongoing action to reduce theof time patients are waiting for surgery. This includes the appointment of new consultant surgeons, the outsourcing of appropriate patients to private hospitals, and additional theatre sessions. Waiting lists are also reviewed weekly to ensure patients with the highest clinical needs are given priority. Ms Evans did not meet the clinical criteria for outsourcing and required an inpatient bed in one of our hospitals. However, as always, we have to give priority to patients with le limb-threatening conditions, cancer and trauma patients. Unfortunately as a result of this we were unable to offer Ms Evans an earlier date, though we are very pleased her surgery went ahead earlier this year.

It also emerged the average diet lasts less than three months before dieters revert back to their old ways, and three in  are sick of eating healthily within the first month. Despite two thirds of dieters admitting they enjoy eating healthy food,  per cent said they find healthier cuisine more boring than food which is bad for them. And it all appears to be in the lack of feeding the senses.  One third miss the smell of unhealthy meals when they are in the midst of a health kick, and one in eight thinks junk food has a better texture than any leafy greens. And three in five think trying to eat healthily reduces the enjoyment they get out of eating. The study also found to ensure they get more of an enjoyable eating experience, Brits turn to sugary, fatty foods over healthier alternatives. Forty two per cent identy the sweet smoothness of chocolate as their healthy eating Achilles ’ heel, while a third are undone by the flavoursome crunch of crisps. Registered nutritionist and cookery writer Rob Hobson, who has partnered with Tilda, said: “The perceptions around food boredom is a key factor for diet fatigue and the reason why many dieters quickly revert back to old eating habits. “It’s clear from the research findings that our senses have a huge role to play in the food choices we make. “We seek great tasting flavour, appearance, smell and texture in our food.  But it is clear we reach to unhealthy foods such as the flavour of chocolate and the crunch of crisps to satisfy these needs as the perception of healthy dishes hitting a multi-sensory note is more dficult to achieve. “Convenience and ease of preparation are also highlighted as reasons why people find it dficult to stick to a healthy diet, with  per cent of dieters of the view that they would eat meals that are better for themthey were easier to prepare and more readily accessible. “If you combine this with all the other misconceptions around healthy food this creates a huge barrier to eating well.

The -year-old, who does not wish to be named, says it all kicked off on from .am on Wednesday, January  at their house in Hull. An argument is believed to have broken out between her and a delivery man after she requested that he stopped beeping his horn outside their home.

He is then said to have ed moments later with another six men inside another car, who tried to smash their way into the familys house. CCTV footage taken from the mums home appears to capture part of the incident. According to the footage one man is seemingly seen hitting the metal gate before dragging a woman away and attacking her.   The womans three-year-old son was allegedly banged in the head by the door that one of the men smashed against the wall, which left him with a painful lump on his head. Meanwhile her partner is said to have been chased with a kne and her sister badly beaten while trying to keep the men outside. The woman told Hull Live: We ordered from [the takeaway] as we do every Tuesday when my partner gets in from working late, and we put on the JustEat form for the driver to ring us when he got there, as it can be hard for them to find our house. The driver never rang us and just kept bibbing his horn really loud for us to come out, so we did and asked him to stop as we didnt want him to wake all the neighbours up, and thats when he turned real nasty and started shouting at us and tried to run my brother-in-law down.   He then came back with another car full of men - there must have been seven in total - and they were armed with knives and bats and one of them even had a gun and they tried to burst the door down to get in to the house. She added: It was proper frightening - they dragged my sister to the floor and punched and hit her and grabbed and smashed her wrist as she was trying to protect the five kids in the house and stop the men getting in. My little three-year-old boy ended up with a lump on his head as the door hit him when the gang was trying to get in.   My partner tried to draw the men out of the house and he ended up getting chased down Anlaby Road by a man with a kne before they eventually left us alone after we said we called the police, but it took them over half an hour before they got to us and by then the men were gone. What happened is just such a massive shock - the men were so brutal and it was so scary - none of us can still believe that it happened. To top it off, we spent pound and didnt even get the food or our money back. Humberside Police say they have received complaints from both parties and are looking into the incident.

And throughout the traumatic ordeal, the sex party organiser said that she thought of the Duchess of Cambridge while in hospital. She told MailOnline: I couldn’t help thinking about my old friend over Christmas because we now both have three children of similar ages. Now Emma plans to repay the The Children’s Trust charity that helped her during the family’s ordeal. Emma founded Killing Kittens in London and has since expanded to Manchester and other locations across the world. A spokeswoman for the parties, known as Jordie, previously dismissed suggestions the nights were immoral and revealed that guests are some of the nicest people you would ever wish to meet.  She said: “There’s no pressure on anyone to get involved. You can watch or be watched. It can be girl on girl, a threesome or a foursome or whatever you want to do. We get a lot of single girls who want to explore their sexuality or just to have a great night. It’s totally up to them. There is literally no pressure. “We have all kinds of dferent people from builders, doctors, solicitors, policemen and paramedics. We’ve even had a couple of celebrities, although there’s no way I would name names. People get introduced to each other. There’s music and it’s really welcoming and friendly.There are play roomspeople wander off. It’s basically a really nice house party.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum shunned friends family after","story":"NewsMum shunned by friends and family after dating again eight weeks after husband diesNatalie Drury, , from Greater Manchester went on to meet her new partner, Paul, through a dating website a year after her husband diedShareCommentsBySophie Norris:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNatalie Drury, , with late husband Tim Madeley \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA widowed mum claims she was shunned by friends and family members because she began dating eight weeks after her husband died Natalie Drurys husband Tim Madeley, , passed away on New Years Day , following a short battle with brain cancer. Eight weeks later, the -year-old nursery cook went on her first date since he died. Although it didnt progress into a relationship, Natalie claims the criticism she faced then and still faces today has been devastating. Despite receiving support from most of her family, Natalie said that she had a hard time from friends and family - especially those on Tims side. Now happily married for the second time after finding love online, Natalie is speaking to encourage others to stop being so judgemental about love after berevement. Natalie, from Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, said: When Tim took ill in the August, they told me pretty early on what the outcome was going to be. I did my grieving in those four months while he was still here. I knew what was coming and I had to stay strong for our son Oliver.  When Tim died, my friends didnt call because they didnt know what to say, so they didnt say anything at all. I was in shock and so lonely. Eventually I got to the point where I did want to go out and so I went on a date with a local man. It didnt go anywhere but it caused people to say I had disrespected my husband. I had every respect for him - but I knew he was never coming back. I couldnt sit alone in my house crying. I went out and enjoyed myself for a few weeks. People avoid you when a loved one dies. Soon after Tim passed away I was walking down the street and people would cross over because they didnt know what to say. You do feel isolated. If you havent been through it you can never understand. [Finding love again] doesnt mean Ive no respect for Tim. Some people were judgemental, especially at work. I had got a job after he passed. People would say its only been two years but Id say exactly. Do you want me to sit on the sofa wearing black and never go out  People are so quick to judge. Its not right. In the summer prior to his death, Tim and Natalie had been on holiday to Spain with their four-year-old son Oliver while Tim did some painting work.  The couple were away for a week but days into the trip, Natalie noticed her husband was behaving really weird and had been acting daft. A desperate Natalie even called her dad saying she wanted to come home and when the family ed to the UK, Tim visited the doctors. Natalie said: We went on holiday in  to Spain which is when Tim started behaving really weird. Hed be walking with his head on the side orI gave him his lunch on a plate, hed look at me and tip it all on the floor. Wed gone over there because hed agreed to do some work on a villa.  As the week went on, he hadnt done any painting and was just behaving really daft. I began to notice something wasnt right. When we got back, I took him straight to the doctors and they thought hed had a stroke. He went into hospital that night and he was soon diagnosed with a brain tumour. The specialists said that because wed been on holiday the air pressure on the plane had accelerated the tumour. He went to The Christie in Manchester but there was nothing they could do. They gave him chemotherapy but it wasnt doing anything at all. I did mourn. From getting the brain tumour, each of the words that came out Tims mouth you couldnt take seriously. It was like talking to an older person with dementia. He wanted me to be happy and move on.  That December, Natalie scrambled around to afford Christmas presents for Oliver as her husband lay in his hospice bed. During what should have been a happy time of year, she agonised over how to tell her little boy that his dad might not make it through the month. Natalie said: It was horrendous, especially during that Christmas. I was trying to keep things jolly for Oliver but I was struggling for money. Sadly Tim was soon transferred to a hospice. He couldnt speak or move around. It was just terrible. Oliver understood what was happening. He asked me is my daddy going to die . I could have lied and said no. But I sat him down and explained in terms a four-year-old would be able to understand. Tim had been the breadwinner and Id been at home with Oliver, so people rallied round us to make sure he got some Christmas presents. Tim survived through Christmas but the week later he went downhill. On New Years Day  he passed away.  Suffering with the crippling loneliness and grief, Natalie decided to begin dating again just eight weeks later. However when her first dates didnt come to anything, she focused on helping her son Oliver come to terms with losing his dad. By , Natalie decided to get out there once again and started dating again. Although it was almost two years since Tim had died, Natalie claims she was still judged by family and colleagues - even after her she married Paul  months later. Natalie said: At the end of  I joined Plenty of Fish and thats where I met Paul. It was a happy ending. Paul is a lovely man and from the start I told him the whole story. I explained I had a son and he might be sensitive to the situation, but Oliver took to him straight away. It just progressed from there and soon it became our new normal. When we got married it was really sweet.  At the wedding reception looked up at us and said can I play out  He ran over to Paul and said Daddy, can we play out . Oliver still talks about Tim. He has his watch and we speak about him everyday - night and day. Oliver is now eight years old. A lot of people, especially family, we dont speak to. Tim had older children - he was  years older than me. He had five, including Oliver. Im still in contact with two of them now. They were really supportive from the beginning and came to my wedding in the evening. [Some other people on Tims side of the family were] really unsupportive and quite disrespectful. When Natalie got a new job as a nursery cook, she was also questioned about how quickly she had found a new partner. Despite losing some friends and family, Natalie claimed her own family were there for her and believes Oliver was helped by seeing her smile again. Natalie said: I just feel like [those that criticised me about starting to date again] need to take a step back and think. God forbidthey were in that position. You just cant say that. I did join Plenty of Fish but I didnt go out looking for love. I still post about him. I posted on Facebook on New Years Day last year its been nearly three years since you passed and I hope that youre looking down on me on my wedding day. I got a lot of comments - none to my face. My family were so supportive. I think its helped Oliver to see his mum happy again.

The government is advising families with dferent surnames to take supporting documentation to airports with them in order to prove they are related. Earlier this year the Home Office shared an image on Twitter urging parents to take birth or adoption certicates on holiday with them in order to speed up the passport control process. They added: Families with dferent surnames may be asked questions to establish their relationship. The tweet was met with a great deal of indignation from parents on the social  and Labour MP Stella Creasy compared the UK to Gilead - a fictional patriarchal dystopia in novel The Handmaids Tale. One Twitter user responded: I am fundamentally against this. My husband and I have dferent surnames. And our son bears my husbands. Not unusual for parents to have dferent surnames in the st Century. Appalling stuff by @sajidjavid and the Home Office. Another wrote: Just to clary women who chose not to take their husbands surname or have children with a partner they are not married to will be subject to increased border measures. This is what freedom looks like under a Tory government  Straight out of Gilead.  Why might families with dferent surnames be questioned at airports  After sharing the original message the Home Office added a follow-up tweet to explain why the procedure is so important, writing: We have a duty to safeguard children and to prevent people trafficking, child sexual exploitation and other crimes. That is why Border Force officers sometimes need to ask additional questions. On the governments website the situation is explained further: Every day thousands of children arrive at the UK border, manyfrom holiday with their family or with family friends. The safety and welfare of every child is of utmost importance to us and sometimes we may ask a few questionsan adult is not the child’s parent, or has a dferent family name. For more information on Border Forces policy, there is a leaflet parents can access on the governments website.  Advice for families travelling with dferent surnames The government advises that,you are travelling with children who have a dferent surname, you may be asked questions at the border to prove your relationship. You can help by bringing with you the following documents:a birth or adoption certicate showing your relationship with the child orce or marriage certicatesyou’re the parent but have a dferent surname from the child a letter from the child’s parent or social worker giving permission for the child to travel with youLast year, a lawyer warned mums and dads they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border controlthey fail to take the right documents with them, the Manchester Evening News reported. One of those was Wigan mum Hannah Marshall, who was stopped with her daughter Lilly at London Stansted Airport when they ed from a holiday in Denmark. At the time Hannah, , wasnt married to Lillys dad Scott, so while Lilly had the surname Marshall, Hannahs was still Thomas.  Hannah said While queuing I went to one desk with my daughter and my partner and his mum went to another desk for passport control. They looked at both mine and my daughters passports then asked me how I knew the little girl and when I said it was my daughter they asked why I did not have the same last name. They asked my daughter who I was to her and thats when my partner came over and explained that shes his daughter too and as we werent married she had his last name.  They told us that my partner should have taken her through passport control because I would need to prove she was my daughter. They checked my partners passport to prove she held the same last name and then let us through. It can, however, be dficult for a person to prove they are a childs parent on the spot, unless they are carrying the right documents. David Connor heads up the family department at Woodcocks Haworth and Nuttall Solicitors, who have offices in Bury and Lancashire and says parents need to plan ahead to avoid being caught out. He said: People need to take extra caution when holidaying with children who don’t share their surname as they could unknowingly end up embroiled in a child abduction case, be refused past check-in, or turned away at border control. It’s vital you have the correct documentation to hand or it could derail your trip. For separated families, you’ll need evidence of approval from your child’s other parent, but remember to seek approval from everyone with parental responsibility – this may include grandparents too. He added: You’ll also need a copy of any Child Arrangement Order which proves you have court approval to take the child abroad. It’s vital that all evidence marries up and this is where orced parents are often caught out, particularly women who revert back to their maiden name. A change of name deed will help here, which can be supplied by a solicitor. Take a copy of your child’s birth certicate with you too to prove who you are. You wont need permission from an absent parenttheyre not on the childs birth certicate, butan absent parent has passed away you may be required to take the death certicate with you. If an absent parent doesnt consent to you taking the child out of the country you will need to go to court to try and resolve the matter.

The Queens granddaughter impressed fashion lovers with her gorgeous wedding dress, designed by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos, which showed off the scars from her scoliosis operation. For the black tie evening reception she changed into a stunning blush coloured dress by Zac Posen, and she looked the perfect princess. But Eugenie opted for a very dferent look for the second day of her wedding weekend, and the designer behind the look has described it as unusual. The couple had a festival and funfair themed party on the Saturday, complete with cocktails, rides and a live performance from Ellie Goulding.  Designer Sam Dougal created a short white dress and a Pink Ladies style jacket with Mrs Brooksbank embroidered across the back. The design is in Eugenies handwriting. Sam said: The look is an exciting and unusual one for a royal wedding, and had to go with the feel of the day. The three of us worked on possible ideas and directions and decided to go with a young and super fun aesthetic. Much like Eugenie, the look is totally unique, and full of fun. Its a simple party dress with a modern jacket.  The jacket keeps it young and modern and doesnt take itself too seriously. And to imagine a royal bride in a biker jacket celebrating her wedding at Windsor Castle – its fun and unexpected. Jack and Eugenie tied the knot at St Georges Chapel in Windsor in October, the same venue Prince Harry and Meghan Markle picked for their wedding. Despite being further down the royal line, the couples wedding was much bigger than the Sussexes, with  guests including a host of celebrities. Prince George and Princess Charlotte acted as page boy and bridesmaid on the special day.

Laura Kreuzter, , from Selm, Germany, first met the love of her le three years ago on a bus that she took every day. Kai Semmelmann,  was the bus driver and after locking eyes several times in the rear-view mirror, Laura plucked up the courage to speak to him. She tracked him down on Facebook and a couple of days later, the pair met for a coffee and fell head-over-heals. The -year age gap didnt worry Laura at all, but Kai was slightly apprehensive at first as he was worried about what people would think of them.  Lauras parents were not impressed by her relationship and didnt talk to her for a year when they first got together and still refuse to speak to Kai today. Despite this, the couple live together and have been through more than most after Kai suffered a heart attack in April last year. Kai said: My girlfriend Laura always had to travel by bus and she would always take my bus.She thought that I was really nice but she didnt care to talk to me very much.  But one day, she wrote to me on Facebook and we met a few days later for a coffee and then fell in love with each other. It was love at first sight. Laura loved my looks and personality right from the start and the same goes for me. We were attracted to each other from the start. Our age dference is twenty-two-years and for Laura, this was not a problem but I struggled because of what people might think of us. Lauras parents were so outraged and the contact between Laura and her parents was put on ice. After about a year, Lauras mother ed to Laura and started talking to her again. I still have no contact with Lauras family, because they do not want to accept me.  Laura said: For me, it was a very bad situation because parents should actually be happytheir daughter is happy and they are at their happiest when in a relationship. It was terrible because Kai is the love of my le. When Kai had his heart attack, I was with him for every second and I supported him wherever I could. I was scared to death that I would lose him and I wouldnt have been able to handle that so I helped him where I could. Laura and Kai do receive funny looks when they are out and about in public but they are now looking forward to moving into a new apartment at the start of the year.  I suffered a heart attack in April  and that was very bad for Laura because I could not work. I had to visit a rehab centre in Ennepetal so she was heavily burdened during this time and wasnt expecting something like this to happen because she was so young, said Kai. We have been living together for almost three years now and have finally found a new apartment and move into it at the beginning of the year.  There are people who say nothing but give us stupid and contemptuous looks when they see us out and about. There are also people who look the other way and there are the people who smile when they see us. Our message to the rest of the world and to the people who criticise us, we have love to give each other and no one in the world is going to stop that.

But as  dawns and its time to go back to school and work, the sagging branches are looking a bit sad and rooms are feeling just a bit too crammed full. Theres probably more pine needles on the floor than on the lower boughs, and that traditional Christmas tree smell has all but faded. You may have already taken them down, but the tradition, since the Victorian era, is to remove decorations on Twelfth Night. Every year this very tradition causes confusion, as people are left scratching their heads wondering when the date falls and why. Heres the answers and the date when you should take down your decorations. When is Twelfth Night   Depending on what youre celebrating its either January  or January  - and the last day you should keep festive decorations up. A day sooner or later is considered unlucky anddecorations are not removed on Twelfth Night then according to tradition they should stay up all year. Until the th century though, people would keep their decorations up until Candlemas Day on February . Twelfth Night falls on January  and Epiphany on January . Twelfth Night is so called because traditionally Christmas was a  day celebration, beginning on December . This can create some confusion as some will class January  as Twelfth Night because it is the th day after Christmas. Epiphany marks the end of Christmas when the Three Kings came to visit bearing gts, guided by the star which is now represented in the twinkling lights adorning our homes. Why is it unlucky   January  is observed as the last day of Christmas festivities - the eve of the Epiphany. In the past it was believed that tree-spirits lived in the greenery – such as holly and ivy – that people used to decorate their homes. While the festive season provided shelter for these spirits during the winter, they needed to be released outside once Christmas was over. If this custom wasn’t followed, greenery would notand vegetation would not grow as a result, causing agricultural and then food problems. Even though Christmas decorations are now less about foliage and more about baubles, glitter, tinsel and singing Santas, many people still adhere to the superstition. Do all countries follow this tradition   No. Because there is disagreement as to whether January  or January  is actually Twelfth Night lots of countries end up taking down their festooned trees at dferent times. This can also depend on when people actually celebrate the festive season - for example in Russia Christmas Day falls on January . But January  is officially the day of the Epiphany. This is from the Christian tradition where the faithful mark the birth of Jesus on December . The Maji didnt arrive until much later with their gtsso Christians mark this on January . Children were traditionally told thatyou took down your decorations before the Eve of the Epiphany, the wise men might not be able to find their way - because Christmas lights represent the Star of Bethlehem which guided them to Jesus. A number of countries in Europe follow the January  tradition, including the Germans, Poles and Czechs. However for some people, simply having the decorations up into the New Year is too much and many will be taking them down on the st of January.  Real Christmas trees will be accepted at most household tips, but local authorities, garden centres and community groups may accept them for recycling. Find out where might be suitable for this in your area.  If your decorations aren’t going into a loft or attic, make sure they’re stored in a watertight, plastic box - in fact, doing this wherever they are kept will protect them from damp and pests. It’s also worth wrapping fragile Christmas ornaments in tissue paper before storage - and, of course, coiling the lights in a neat circle round your arm. Obviously the loft fairies will have tangled them into a mess by next December, but at least you can say you tried when you open them in a frazzled temper next time.  The UK is estimated to use almost , tonnes of card packaging at Christmas, enough to make a cardboard motorway stretching from Birmingham to Lapland and back  times. Recycle Now is urging consumers to recycle this material rather than bin it. Shiny and metallic ieties of wrapping paper are not recyclable, so the campaign advises people to use the ‘scrunch test’ to check. If you scrunch the paper in your hand and it stays in a ball then it can by recycled but it can’tthe paper springs back. If youre recycling bin is full, several shops such as Marks and Spencer run card recycling schemes to raise funds for charity. For every , cards dropped in to MS stores in January, a tree is planted by the Woodland Trust . Last year  million cards were collected and , trees planted.

Bringing in the right people who have been there and done it, have got the drive to take the ball and make something happen and can make the flash that gets us back into the game will make us a lot stronger.”Woods has made a real impact on the side since penning a short-term contract that expired after the weekend loss.Even in that defeat, the former Partick man drew the only positive shout from the crowd as he squared up to a couple of St Johnstone men with the yell ‘at least he’s showing a bit of fight’ coming from the home support.“I would agree with that,” Woods said.“That was out of pure frustration. The crowd in the main have been absolutely brilliant and that’s just not me trying to be the good guy and get everybody up.“I think they’ve been really good for the position the club is in.“They just want people battling, people at it, giving their lot – that’s the least you should be giving. I think those will be the types the manager is after in January, giving what he is like as a guy and what he demands of people.“He’ll want people to go and give their lot, it might not be perfect every week, but they’ll give their full lot and they’ll have some guts.”Though he’s not signed yet till the end of the season, Woods says he’s keen to stay on.He added: “We spoke after the game and that’s ongoing just now, we’ll see what happens.“I’ve loved my time here, the fans have been great with me, the boys have been great, too, getting me right in the mix straight away.“The manager has been really good, I know what I’m getting from him but I think he needs a bit of help so, hopefully, he gets that this month and gets a few boys in who are up for the challenge.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/Greggs-is-launching-a-‘vegan-friendly’-version-of-the-sausage-roll-Greggs-PA.jpg ","title":"dundee and perth miss out on greggs vegan sausage roll but fifers can enjoy new snack","story":"Bakery chain Greggs has promised that its new vegan-friendly sausage roll will arrive in Tayside in future – despite not being available at any local branches at launch.The purveyor of baked goods debuted its Vegan Sausage Roll in over  stores across the country yesterday.Greggs launching ‘vegan friendly’ sausage roll\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph    greggs-launching-vegan-friendly-sausage-roll embed # secretvzoeWDtsec\" data-secret\"vzoeWDtsec\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Greggs launching ‘vegan friendly’ sausage roll# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, while scores of bakeries in England and a handful in Glasgow and Edinburgh took delivery, Dundee and Perth missed out.Customers in Fe are more fortunate, though, with the Euro Garage in Kirkcaldy stocking the new snack.A Greggs spokesman said: “Our Vegan Sausage Rolls are only available in  shops at the moment.

And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem. I sometimes choose what I’m having before I go with the help of my app. I don’t have a sweet tooth so saying no to desserts and cakes is an easy decision for me.” Fatty foods like chips and fried meals have been swapped for fruit, veg, chicken and home-made soup. Trips out are now anxiety free. She revealed: “I am no longer thinking that people are thinking she is only using a stick or scooter because she is fat but they actually see I have a disability. “With my weight loss I am on the list for the Riding for the Disabled Association, and my fingers are crossed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"make-a-date-with-sinatra-and-crosby-this-christmas-in-selkirk","story":"THERES a chance to swing your way into Christmas this weekend in Selkirk with some of the best-known festive hits.Christmas Crooners is coming to Victoria Halls on Sunday as part of their UK tour, now in its tenth record-breaking year.The show features the renowned West-End Singers performing the famous Christmas hits of all the greats, including Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Nat King Cole.They will be showcasing over  of the best-loved festive tunes, such as lsquoDeck the Hallsrsquo, lsquoChestnuts Roastingrsquo and lsquoSanta Babyrsquo, bringing some old-school Christmas glamour to the Borders.Stephen Leatherland, producer and director of the show, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted to be bringing Christmas Crooners to Selkirk and the Border region.\"This fantastic show has brought joy to many people over the last ten years and more, and we look forward to bringing a parcel of Christmas Magic to Selkirk ndash the perfect start to the festive season for young and old alike.Staged in the warm style of the famous Andy Williams Christmas Shows, this production comes complete with Christmas trees, a rocking chair and fireplace.Christmas Crooners is a community-minded event that will bring people together in the local town hall over the Christmas period to celebrate all things festive, with top-quality musicians performing Christmas classics.Hamish Moir, events and programming officer for Live Borders, said: ldquoI canrsquot think of a better way to celebrate the festive season than by heading to the local town hall for an evening of recreating the biggest Christmas hits.\"The Christmas Crooners put on a top quality performance with the West-End singers and Jazz-All-Stars, and we canrsquot wait for them to come to Selkirk for a cosy evening of live music.ldquoWe have a great series of events running over Christmas and in  that would make great gts, and I recommend looking at our website to view the full programme.\"At Live Borders we want to help make communities healthier, happier and stronger, especially at Christmas time, so come and join us on December  for these feel-good hits.Christmas Crooners will be performing in Victoria Halls, Selkirk, on Sunday at :.Tickets, priced at pound., are still available from www.eventbrite or by calling  ."},{"url":null,"title":"council-accused-of-paying-over-the-odds-for-lowood-estate","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has been told ldquoit may come to regret its decision to buy what remains of the Lowood Estate after it was revealed that government valuers advised the authority it would be paying over the odds.The council has spent pound.m on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.Council officers believe that the site, as part of a wider Tweedbank development plan, will create  permanent jobs, and a similar number during the construction phase.The site has also been earmarked for a -home housing estate.At a full meeting of the council yesterday, December , its executive member for business and economic development, Mid-Berwickshire councillor Mark Rowley, told members: ldquoThis was a project set in motion by a previous council.ldquoIn , the previous council agreed to the purchase of Lowood in principle, and over the last few years, work has been developing on this.ldquoWhat makes this incredibly important, probably more important than it was in , is that with all the talk around budgets, the council can no longer just sit back and try to carry on carrying out services.ldquoWe need to take decisive and strategic action, and this is an incredibly bold, and good, large-scale development.ldquoItrsquos maximising benefits wersquore already seeing with the Borders Railway. It strengthens the case, very strongly, for extending the railway to Carlisle, so I am incredibly supportive, as yoursquod expect. I think this helps us grow the Borders on to success.ldquoThe stats sound almost academic and meaningless, but wersquore talking about a development here of hundreds of jobs.ldquoThat is a huge leap for the Borders, especially when these better, higher-paid jobs come in. It gives us a business space of a quality which we donrsquot currently have in the Borders, and it gives us control over a potentially fantastic housing site.ldquoThis is positive and a good news story.Council officers estimate that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, Tweeddale East councillor and opposition leader Stuart Bell claims the estate is valued at much less than the council paid for it.Mr Bell also revealed that Scottish Governmentrsquos district valuation service, a body offering impartial advice on how public money is spent, also told the council the property was not worth what it has paid for it.He told members: ldquoThe Lowood Estate acquisition, which we are undertaking by ourselves, remains a tortured tale.ldquoThe pound.m outlay, plus expenses, plus cost of maintaining the land and assets, plus the cost of borrowing, means wersquoll need to sell it all for over poundm just to break even. ldquoReports we have seen in private say there will also be signicant infrastructure costs to develop the site.ldquoI donrsquot believe this site is worth pound.m when you go into the detail of the terms and conditions of the sale, and that was the opinion of the district valuer, whose assessment with vacant possession, which we will not have, was much lower than pound.m.ldquoEven when adjusted up for a special assumption, the district valuer still valued the land at a price lower than we are paying.ldquoThis is a speculative and risky expenditure of public money at a time when, quite apart from Brexit, there is shuddering uncertainty in markets. ldquoHouse prices and land values can go down as well as up. We should not be spending public money on buying this estate at this time for more than it is worth.ldquoIn what alternative opportunities could we invest poundm ldquoThis council should invest enough in roads to signicantly improve the road condition index, but we cannot afford to do that.ldquoThis council should commit to four new high schools in  years, but you wonrsquot make that commitment.ldquoI will not tell the electors in Peebles, as you will have to, that they cannot have a new high school within  years when you have tied up poundm for  or so years in Tweedbank.ldquoWe canrsquot even cut the grass properly in our cemeteries, but this administration glibly spends poundm on buying a private estate.ldquoThis is a decision I fear you may come to regret.In reply, East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton defended the deal, claiming that pressures on local government spending made such projects necessary, saying: ldquoWersquove had several briefings on this subject, and officers have presented us with an excellent paper on the future benefits of developing this site, especially with the council in control.ldquoNow councillor Bell is scaremongering about service cuts, but this is a smokescreen to keep us away from the real issue at hand, which is the financial pressure being passed down to Scottish local authorities by his SNP colleagues.ldquoScottish local councils are currently expected to continue services while facing continuous cuts.ldquoIt will be very interesting to see what opposition councillors bring to the table for their budget proposals. No doubt there will be some vanity projects.The Tweedbank masterplan, going hand in hand with the Borders Railway blueprint programme, includes earmarking residential and business space on the estate, as well as expanding Tweedbank and rebranding the current industrial estate there as the Borders Innovation Park.The deal agreed with the estatersquos owner, Alexander Hamilton, is for the remaining  acres still in private hands to add to the  acres bought from then owner Constance Hamilton using compulsory powers by the former Roxburgh County Council in the early s to create Tweedbank.The land will now be owned by Lowood Tweedbank, a company set up and owned by the council."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-scots-history-is-on-parade-at-peebles-library","story":"AN historic link between Peebles and what was Britains oldest infantry regiment was further strengthened this week with a presentation at the towns library.The Royal Scots was raised by Royal Warrant in  and subsequently served with distinction for almost four centuries through many campaigns across the globe.The Regiment continued to recruit almost entirely from Edinburgh, the Lothians and Peeblesshire until its amalgamation just over a decade ago.During the First World War the Regiment expanded to  battalions in which over , men served.During the - conflict a total of , Royal Scots made the ultimate sacrice - many from the Borders, including  from Peebles,  from Innerleithen and  from Walkerburn.The Royal Scots served in most of the campaigns of the First World War, from the Western Front to Bulgaria.To mark the close connection with the area the Regiment was awarded the Freedom of Peebles in .As the centenary year of World War I ending draws to a close this month, a presentation was made on Tuesday by representatives of The Royal Scots Association at Peebles Library.Nick Edwardson and Alex Dockar presented a rare three-volume History of the Royal Scotsto head librarian Alison Tait.Mr Edwardson told us: \"The presentation of the volumes acknowledges the contribution made by the county of Peeblesshire to the story of Britainrsquos senior infantry regiment.\"The Regiment was amalgamated in  but its long history of proud service continues today as part of st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.The Colours of the Regimentrsquos th Battalion which historically had a particular association with Peebles were laid up in the town in .And they are now displayed outside the entrance to the library in the Chambers Institute.The three-volume History of the Royal Scots will now be available for everyone to read in the library."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-for-parents-to-register-children-for-nursery-places","story":"PARENTS in the Borders are being invited to register their children for a place at nursery.Enrolment week takes place from Monday, January , to Friday, January .

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people. Our identity is not primarily male or female, trans, intersex, other, or whatever label fits. We are simply and essentially human, with all the complexities of personality, type, and biases that entails. Since wersquore in it all together, thatrsquos also how we should sort things out."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-luther-is-back-and-guess-who-knocked-on-his-door","story":"Doctor Who BBC ***A SUSPECT sprints into a dockyard, pursued by a Volvo driven by a demon lawman.

A clear majority of the pupils really enjoy taking part in all of the science activities listed. Doing experiments in class was the most enjoyed activityldquoP-P pupil beliefs regarding science were generally positive. There was a strong indication that many of the pupils were keen to be involved with science when they left school.ldquoHowever, there was little indication that they could see themselves as a scientist in the future, which may coincide with the relatively low levels of those who know someone who works in science.Researchers said a key strength of the new approach in Raise schools was the use of primary science development officersto help teachers expand on existing science education.These officers are supported by a national education officer for primary science, employed by The Wood Foundation, but seconded to national schools body Education Scotland.The Robert Owen Centre report concluded: ldquoThe evidence to date strongly indicates that the PSDOs are working effectively to promote Raise objectives and that the national education officer has had a critical role in ensuring the coherence of the overall approach and in supporting the development of the PSDOs.Sharon Smith, the PSDO for West Dunbartonshire Council, believes the Raise approach is having a signicant impact.She said the key to success was engaging with families as early as possible to ensure they had a positive attitude towards the study of science.ldquoWe have been holding science open evenings to get whole families to come to school and take part in experiments. We had families building model propeller boats and getting them to move across a water trough, she explained.ldquoI had a grandmother try out the experiment and she said she had always been rubbish at science at school, but was delighted she could do it and that is the key.ldquoBy involving the parents and the grandparents you are starting to re-write some of the mindsets they have from their own experiences of much more traditional science experiments.Mrs Smith said modern science lessons should be focused on investigation to allow pupils to come up with their own ideas for research and then back it up with experiments.ldquoIt is trying to build up the habits of trial and error in a group setting where they are working as a team and learning from mistakes. We find a lot more buzz about the lessons and much more of a focus on on investigating and being curious.Headteachers in West Dunbartonshire have welcomed the new approach. Karen Hollern, headteacher at Balloch Primary, said: ldquoThe programme has permeated our whole curriculum and our pupils have benefited hugely from being involved in it.ldquoThey have gained in confidence, engaged with teachers and have shown great enthusiasm for the ious dferent experiments and practical projects we have undertaken.A spokeswoman for The Wood Foundation said the creation of strong foundations for science in primary was critical to developing the workforce of the future.

Which gave us an insight into how Mr Trump handles the Press.It also emerged The Donald had given The Theresa a bit of helpful advice: sue the EU.Just before the summer recess the PMrsquos Chequers Plan was formally declared dead as the Government accepted changes to its plan on trade by Jacob Rees-Moggrsquos European Research Group. No  insisted the changes were consistent with Mrs Mayrsquos proposal but it looked like many to a cave-in to keep the hard right-wingers on board.The Government began its tranche of technical notices on what would happenthere were a no-deal, including sending in the Army to deliver food, medicine and fuel supplies. Supermarkets were also beginning to stockpile.There have, of course, been the occasional distractions from the runaway train that is Brexit some offering genuine relief to the Tories and others just piling on the pressure.They included the plunge in UK-Russia relations over the attempted poisoning of the Skripals using a military grade nerve agent and the subsequent murder of Dawn Sturgess the Windrush scandal that cost Amber Rudd her job as Home Secretary the purported ldquoend of austerity with pay rises for public sector workers official approval of the third runway at Heathrow and the football World Cup.Then, of course, there was Ruth Davidson and her uplting announcement that she was pregnant Finn duly arrived in October, meaning that during the ongoing psychodrama at least one senior Tory was back stage, tending to other, more important matters.As the conference season got underway, Brussels delivered its own rebuff to Mrs May, rejecting her Chequers Plan. By the time it came to her keynote conference speech even twinkle-toes Theresa could not bear to mention the phrase by name.As October progressed, the Tory leader was looking for a way out of the seemingly intractable backstop issue and suggested perhaps extending the transition period.Despite her assurances, particularly to the Scottish Conservatives, that Britain would become an independent coastal state by the end of the transition period in December , she conspicuously failed to say what would happenthis were extended. The assumption, certainly in Brussels, was thatthe transition period were extended, then so too would the UKrsquos alignment with the hated EU Common Fisheries Policy. Scottish Secretary David Mundell wrote to the PM, making clear that reneging on commitments to Scotlandrsquos fishermen would be a resigning matter.As autumn progressed pressure was beginning to build from all sides.In late October, some , people marched in London in support of a Peoplersquos Vote anathema to Mrs May.The Confederation of British Industry reported  per cent of UK firms had cancelled or delayed investments due to Brexit uncertainty double the figure from a year earlier.Mid-November saw another landmark Cabinet meeting when, we were told, senior ministers backed the PM and her plan following a ldquolong, detailed and impassioned debate\".But as with Chequers beforehand, the aftermath saw the resignation of another Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab. His Cabinet colleague Esther McVey bailed out too as did two junior ministers.Crucially, the others on resignation-watch did not follow suit most notably Michael Gove, who stayed on as Environment Secretary to fight to change the deal in the mid to long term. If he had gone, then the Scot might have sparked the departure of others and brought Mrs May down.At yet another EU summit, the EU agreed the PMrsquos Plan, the ldquobest and only deal possible.Tensions mounted in SW as the anti-EU Tory European Research Group boasted the  signatures needed to mount a no-confidence vote were in but then had to back down. Their day would come though.By now the pyschodrama was entering the beginning of its most crucial act at Westminster.After yet another ministerial resignation, Sam Gyimahrsquos - the th - the Government was found in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish in full the Attorney Generalrsquos legal advice. MPs also voted for the amendment tabled by former Tory Cabinet Minister Dominic Grieve to give Parliament control should Mrs Mayrsquos Plan be rejected.The next day, the Government published the legal advice, revealing the backstop could ldquoendure indefinitelyno agreement was reached.The following week saw the most dramatic -hour period in the psychodrama to date.On the day the European Court of Justice ruled Britain could cancel Article  without the consent of the EU, the PM called an emergency Cabinet meeting and announced the postponement of the vote on her deal, knowing she was facing a humiliating defeat.The next day, Mrs May was in Brussels trying to improve the deal, most notably on the backstop, but without joy. At Westminster, MPs debated her decision to pull the vote. Some ministers began to air alternatives to the PMrsquos plan a sure sign she had lost control.Rumours that the  signatures to call a no-confidence vote in the Tory leader abounded and were confirmed the following morning by Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  Committee. By that afternoon the vote was taken and the PM won the vote. Yet,  Conservative MPs said they had no confidence in her more than a third of the party. She battled on but her authority was badly dented.Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence vote. But it was not in the Tory Government as a whole, rather in Mrs Mayrsquos leadership alone. This meant, by parliamentary convention, the Government did not have to allow Commons time for a debate and a vote. Critics said it was nothing more than an empty gesture.And now as we gird our loins for the next intensive episode of what has become a national psychodrama, who knows how many more political casualties there will be. By the end of this month Mrs May could well be one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed-by-tv-version-of-les-mis-here-comes-the-real-thing","story":"ldquoThose pictures looked exactly like the set of Les Miserables, says the composer of one of the most iconic pieces of musical theatre in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.ldquoFirst of all it made me realise that Les Miserables is still relevant. Secondly, it also made me realise that in  years we have learnt nothing.Maybe this is why the current year-long UK tour of Les Miserables, originally adapted by Schonberg and writer Alan Boublil from Victor Hugorsquos  novel, has pretty much sold out already.Arriving in Edinburgh this month for the first time in  years for a month-long run, the English-language version of Boublil and Schonbergrsquos show has been a fixture of the London theatre circuit since Trevor Nunn directed a co-production between the Royal Shakespeare Company and Cameron Mackintosh at the Barbican in .This makes it the second longest-running musical in the world.Despite the success of putting Hugorsquos story charting ex-convict Jean Valjeanrsquos travails through poverty-stricken France onstage, Schonberg for one isnrsquot quite sure of the reasons why it happened.ldquoItrsquos a phenomenon I donrsquot really understand, the now -year old composer admits of a creation which introduced the world to songs now regarded as modern classics such as I Dreamed A Dream, ldquobut the show is more popular than ever. I must say, Irsquom totally surprised.By the time Les Miserables opens at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh, the new six-part TV adaptation of Hugorsquos book scripted by Andrew Davies will be mid-way through its own run. With Dominic West playing Valjean as part of a cast that includes Olivia Coleman and David Oyelowo, rather than claiming kin with Boublil and Schonbergrsquos take on things, advance publicity appears to pointing up the fact that it is categorically not the musical, and shouldnrsquot be confused as such. Viewers and critics have already criticised this sans songs version as being flat.With Les Mis the musical itself filmed in  with Hugh Jackman as Valjean, this too is something Schonberg doesnrsquot understand.ldquoWhenever I read an article about the BBC version, they are saying it is the real version of the novel and not the trivial musical stage version, he says.ldquoI donrsquot know how you can promote something against it. People know the title because of the musical show, but each time therersquos an adaptation, they all make the point that they are not going to have anyone singing. But who knows  This one might be very good. I will look at it carefully.Schonberg probably doesnrsquot need to worry too much. As he points out, there has been more than  films based on Hugorsquos novel, with over  TV adaptations as well as another  dferent versions onstage. This is how great stories work as they are reimagined for every age. Indeed, it was another musical adaptation of a nineteenth century novel that was the starting point for Les Miserables.ldquoAlain saw Oliver! in London, says Schonberg, who had previously collaborated with Boublil on La Revolution Francaise, Francersquos first rock opera, produced in . ldquoI said to Alain, next time we find a big subject, we have it as a sung-through musical, and when Alain saw Oliver!, that gave us an idea about how to do it.Lionel Bartrsquos musical version of Charles Dickensrsquo novel, Oliver Twist, had already been adapted for film by Carol Reed in  by then, after being first seen on the West End eight years earlier. Prior to putting Les Miserables onstage, as was the fashion then, Boublil and Schonberg released a recording of it as a concept album. This approach had already paid idends for the English musical theatre team of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber with Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita, and Schonberg had already scored hit records in France.Three years after the Les Miserables concept album had led to the showrsquos original French production, it was heard by British producer Cameron Mackintosh after it was passed on to him by director Peter Farago.ldquoTwo years after the show closed in Paris, Cameron was organising his records and put it on, Schonberg recalls. ldquoand after that we heard he was looking for those crazy French guys, Schonberg and BoublilWhile the pair worked on new drafts of Les Miserables, Mackintosh was riding high on the success of Cats, directed by Trevor Nunn, who had also overseen David Edgarrsquos epic staging of Dickensrsquo Nicholas Nickleby, and knew how to put on a big show. Success was far from guaranteed, however, and the opening night of Les Mis was a critical disaster.ldquoThe critics were very bad,rsquo says Schonberg, actually using the v word eight times. ldquoCameron has a tradition of having a lunch the day after an opening night, and it was like a funeral. We thought it was finished, and during the lunch Cameron kept trying to call the box office to measure the scale of the disaster, but couldnrsquot get through. Eventually he received a message to say that the reason he couldnrsquot get through was that the show had sold , tickets, and in two weeks would be sold out.Les Miserables went on to win an Olivier Award for the most popular show, while on Broadway it won three Tony awards.The current touring version is directed by Laurence Connor and James Powell for a production reinvigorated for the showrsquos th anniversary in . The result is a very st century Les Mis, which utilises projections based on paintings by Hugo created by son et lumiere auteurs Fty-Nine Productions. The internationally renowned team led by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, who have come a long way since their early work at the Traverse Theatre, the National Theatre of Scotland and with Stellar Quines Theatre Company.Having worked worldwide on the National Theatrersquos production of War Horse and the  Olympics, more recently  have been responsible for opening events of the Edinburgh International Festival, Deep Time, Bloom and the First World war-themed Five Telegrams. The latter projected images onto the walls of the Usher Hall accompanied by a thundering score by Anna Meredith.ldquoThere have been so many improvements to Les Miserable this year,rsquo says Schonberg. ldquoThat has a lot to do with technological developments which wouldnrsquot have been possible even five years ago.This keeps the show fresh for several generations of theatre-goers, as was proven last week, when Schonberg met a woman who told him how shersquod seen Les Miserables a staggering  times.ldquoFor Christmas she was taking her children and grand-children to see the show with hr again,rsquo he says.What Les Miserables taps into, again, Schonberg isnrsquot sure about. All he can say is that ldquoI think we did the right job, but it is the novel that is responsible for the success of the show, and for whatever reason, people seem to leave the theatre a bit dferent. People are scared for the future. Theyrsquore all looking for a bright tomorrow and waiting for the sun to shine, and people come out of the show perhaps believing they can be a better person.Les Miserables, Festival Theatre, Edinburgh, January -February .www.capitaltheatreswww.lesmis"},{"url":null,"title":"impact-of-brexit-on-scotlands-construction-sector-to-be-examined-by-holyrood","story":"The inquiry will also consider the effect technological changes and automation will have on the industry - which employs more than , people, % of the Scottish workforce.The work is to be carried out by the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, with convener Gordon Lindhurst saying MSPs are keen to discover how challenges facing the building industry can be overcome.:Scottish construction firms fear Brexit will hike labour costsHe said: \"Construction is a vital sector in Scotland as it drives and underpins the economy with its knock-on effect on other sectors.\"As well as being a major employer, the sector also delivers infrastructure for housing, transport, education and community, and contributes pound. billion to Scotlands gross domestic product.\"However, the sector has its challenges and we want to hear views and suggestions on how these can be overcome.

nightmare","story":"Former RAF pilot Don Mason, who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year honours list in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.ldquoWe had been in No.  Group Bomber Command, says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. ldquoThe whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. ldquoWe had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogetherhellip It required a lot of dferent techniques.ldquoAnd it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore yoursquod got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.ldquoThere developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.ldquoOn one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnrsquot just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.ldquoObviously we knew something was happening, Don says, ldquobecause we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werenrsquot aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. ldquoBefore that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: ldquoOne thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Donrsquos chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as ldquoPiccadilly Circus ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.ldquoWe were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place, he explains. ldquoIt was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. ldquoThey all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. ldquoHe released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one, says Don.ldquoThere was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnrsquot a great deal of resistance.It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crewmates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: ldquoThe Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.ldquoYou couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnrsquot want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  ldquoWell, everybodyrsquos scared ndash I donrsquot care what anyone says, he replies. ldquoIf yoursquore not scared you donrsquot perform, but itrsquos discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .ldquoThis is rude, I know, but itrsquos what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Itrsquos a matter of accepting whatrsquos going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job yoursquore supposed to do.ldquoItrsquos not a question of bravery. Irsquom very suspicious when people say, lsquoOh, yoursquore a brave man,rsquo or lsquoYouve got a lot of courage.rsquo You react to circumstances. Itrsquos a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.ldquoAnd I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when yoursquove got a unorm on and yoursquore acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.ldquoSo Irsquom very suspicious about lsquobraveryrsquo. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I donrsquot think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I donrsquot know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.DON can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.ldquoI fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhamrsquos Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating, Don says. ldquoHe had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a manrsquos wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.ldquoBut the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thatrsquos what I did.He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash ldquoI went to Arnhem five times during that debacle, says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until rsquo.He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crewmates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.ldquoAlthough our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand, says Don. ldquoIn  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnrsquot got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hersquod said, lsquoIrsquod love to see my old mate again.rsquo So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.ldquoNow you canrsquot explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Itrsquos what they call camaraderie. Irsquom still in touch with his family.As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash ldquotherersquos no doubt about that. But he adds: ldquoI regret to say I donrsquot think wersquove learned any lessons. I donrsquot think we should be doing what wersquore doing now [in Iraq].ldquoAs I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Itrsquos not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action.

Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue.

The final cost is expected to rise by another £.bn over budget.The National Audit Office has put the total cost of running and updating the UK’s nuclear deterrent at over £bn, and last year said it would be “crucial” to find ways of cutting the bill to make it affordable.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson argued for extra money in last year’s budget, but was given just £bn to fill the gaps.Cost pressures have forced a two-year delay to construction of the Astute-class of nuclear-powered attack submarines.Trevor Taylor, a naval specialist at military think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, told the Financial Times that “nuclear subs are the most demanding defence project”. “You do not get to build a prototype – you have to get it right first time.”Mr Taylor said: “Can Dreadnought sink the defence budget  The answer is yes.”He added: “At what point does an independent British deterrent become unaffordable  For me, there is such a commitment to this that they would spend whatever was needed.”Richard Scott, naval consultant editor at defence journal Jane’s, said MoD officials were privately voicing their own fears about the costs of replacing Trident.“You hear comments about the disproportionate impact the deterrent has on the overall defence budget,” Mr Scott said. “Some people are asking, ‘can we really justy this’ ”In March, the MoD was allowed to use £m of a £bn contingency fund held by the Treasury to ensure the Dreadnought programme, being delivered by BAE Systems at Barrow-in-Furness, remained on track.Announcing the funding, Prime Minister Theresa May said it was “another sign of the deep commitment this Government has to keeping our country safe”.Defence contractor BAE has described the programme as “one of the world’s most complex engineering challenges”.Dreadnought submarines, which like their predecessors will be based at Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland, will be powered by a new model of nuclear reactor that will not be able to be tested in prototype, posing the biggest risk to the project, according to analysts.SNP MSP Bill Kidd said the cost of the Trident renewal programme was “enormous and unjustiable”. He claimed an independent Scotland would be able to avoid “paying through the nose for these wasteful and immoral weapons”.“It is increasingly obvious that the UK Government’s single-minded obsession with nuclear weapons is going to come at a huge cost to our conventional defence,” Mr Kidd said.“The staggering revelation that even senior military officials are now questioning whether we can justy Trident renewal should give the Tories – and Labour – a reality check.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4850891.1546504252!/image/image.jpg","title":"poll 72 of labour members back second brexit vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has defied calls to throw his weight behind a second referendum on the European Union despite a poll suggesting almost three-quarters of Labour members want one and thousands could quit the party unless it works to bring one about.A survey of more than , party members found  per cent want a so-called People’s Vote on the terms of Brexit and most would chose to stay in the EUgiven the option.But Mr Corbyn has long resisted such calls. Asked yesterdayhe would change his stance, the Labour leader said: “What we will do is vote against having no deal, we’ll vote against Theresa May’s deal.“And at that point she should go back to Brussels and say, ‘This is not acceptable to Britain’ and renegotiate a customs union, form a customs union with the European Union to secure trade.”At last year’s Labour Party conference a motion was passed that saidanother general election was not called, then Mr Corbyn should pursue another referendum on Brexit.Speaking about the motion he told reporters the policy was ­“sequential” on a range of issues, adding: “The issue of another referendum was, of course, one of the options, but that was very much after the votes have taken place in Parliament.“We haven’t yet had a vote and I think the government really should be ashamed of itself. This vote has been delayed and delayed and delayed. “It’s finally going to take place the second week of January. That is not acceptable. This vote should have taken place more than a month ago.“This government is just trying to run down the clock and create a sense of fear between either no deal or May’s deal. Well, both of those options are completely unacceptable.”The YouGov poll, carried out for the Economic and Social Research Council-funded Party Members Project, found strong backing for a second vote among Labour supporters. A total of  per cent of existing Labour voters and  per cent of those who backed the party at the  election wanted Mr Corbyn to “fully support” a fresh referendum.Almost a quarterof Labour members put Mr Corbyn’s failure to back a second referendum down to a belief that he supports Brexit.Some  per cent opposed the stance the party has taken on Brexit and  per cent of those told researchers it had caused them to consider quitting. That proportion would be equivalent to around , members, according to the project’s analysis.If there was another referendum and a three-way question, some  per cent of Labour members said they would back Remain, \u2028 per cent said they would vote Leave with Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal and \u2028 per cent would support leaving with no deal.Labour backbencher Luciana Berger, who supports the People’s Vote campaign, said Mr Corbyn was “wrong to suggest that either he or Theresa May can negotiate a better Brexit deal”.She said: “It’s time the leadership stopped hiding behind process and faced up to the scale of the crisis and took the side of the people.”SNP MP Stephen Gethins called for opposition parties to find common ground in a bid to stop the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland. was a milestone in a changing Ireland. It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

He had made arrangements with Antrim Borough Council to have their carriage kitted out with flowers and champagne, only for his plans to be put on ice due to the weather.Not one to hang around, he put together a back-up plan to ask Leanne for her hand in marriage at the Templeton Hotel in Templepatrick.Leanne, , said: “We’re five years together, we’ve one child at four and another on the way. Romance is sort of put to the side. I hadn’t a clue this was coming. Leannes four-year-old daughter Quinn was there to witness the romantic moment on Sunday“We had our gym party on Saturday night. The idea was to go up the big wheel first then go to the party and be able to tell everyone, celebrate with them and show them the ring.“Because of the weather warning, rather than wait, he went for plan B.”At the Templeton they were taken to a reserved table decorated with crystals where staff brought out drinks and a plate with ‘Marry Me ’ written on it in chocolate.Leanne said: “Then he got down on one knee and gave me the ring. It was really romantic. I was crying my eyes out. Then he told me what I could have won.”She added: “At least we got a second go at it. The big wheel will probably be the story we’ll tell peopleanyone asks how we got engaged.“Our daughter Quinn, four, was with us the second time.

offer in case of emergency card","story":"Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Policing and Community Safety Partnership , in partnership with local police is launching a new community safety initiative, in case of emergency card , to make sure people get the best treatment at a time when they need it most.Indicating who should be contacted in the event of an accident or emergency, the ICE Card also provides your medical information including any conditions or allergies you may have, medication you are taking and your blood type.An emergency can strike anywhere - you might be far from home, family or friends - and carrying the ICE Card means that your loved ones can be reached quickly and avoids the problem of unlocking mobile for emergency details.Stressing the importance of carrying an ICE Card, Chair of ABC PCSP, Councillor Joe Nelson commented: “This is a very simple yet effective initiative. Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Speaking to the North Belfast News, Neil Francis said: “Me and my friends were walking out of the playground and this baby walked down towards the pond. We saw a woman pointing towards the baby and he slipped into the water face first. “All the other people started panicking and they all ran over and people were screaming. I got on my stomach and tried to reach in to get him, but I couldn’t reach so I just jumped in lted him under the armpits and lted him out.“A woman took the baby and cleaned him and dried him. I was scared, but nobody  seemed to be doing anything so I just jumped in. I was worried that it might be a bit deep, but I was more worried about the baby. I’m just really happy that the baby wasn’t hurt.”Neil Francis has been recognised as hero at his school assembly, and was gted a superman t-shirt by his religion teacher Mr Wylie. Paul Berne, acting Principal at Edmund Rice College, said: “We’re delighted that these kids are able to do what they’re doing. It’s the second time our pupils have saved someone’s le in a month.

About a month ago a sixth year helped someone in a hit-and-run and now we have this.It’s great that young people that age are able to do that – it’s incredible. Some people would freeze in these situations. These kids are top class. It’s a very tough thing and a very brave and courageous thing for any child to do.”Neil Francis’ mum, Natalie, added: “We’re so proud of him.

That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"10 things nonbrits find weird about britain according","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential. It is available to all men and women affected by domestic and sexual violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for upgrade at Ardglass harbour  ","story":"THE need for major improvements at Ardglass harbour to allow signicantly larger vessels to enter the port has been highlighted by former South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.Her comments come after last monthrsquos annual EU Fisheries Council meeting in Brussels which determines how much fish can be landed at the local port and at the neighbouring harbours of Kilkeel and Portavogie.EU chiefs have decided to reduce prawn quotas by just over % to ensure the species ldquostays within sustainable levels, while the herring quota has been reduced by %.The Fisheries Council also determines how many days boats can put to sea, but the December meeting will have been the last UK fishermen were represented at ahead of the Brexit at the end of March.Welcoming some of the outcomes from the Brussels negotiations, Miss Ritchie has urged British and Irish governments to resolve what she described as ldquooutstanding problems in the fisheries sector to build the economies at the three Co Down fishing ports.She explained that the Fisheries Council consists of EU Fisheries Ministers who decide on the annual quota allocations for range of species mdash including prawns and white fish mdash which are the main staple of Northern Ireland fishermen.Miss Ritchie said she was concerned there has been a slight decrease in the amount of prawns which can be landed locally, after a series of successive quota increases over recent years.ldquoIt is important that the British Government has realistic proposals capable of implementation in place to safeguard and grow our local industry, said Ms Ritchie.ldquoThere are also other fishing issues that require resolution as they present ongoing challenges to the catching and processing sectors. They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

Mr Turner said that the CAJ “describe themselves as ‘an independent civil liberties organisation formed in  to work for the highest standards in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland’”.He said that the group had in recent years produced reports about inquests, complaints, the use of force by the security forces and emergency legislation.The restricted February   memo went on to say that CAJ had “increasingly used ‘international force’ in an attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Government’”.He said that “the RUC’sdescription of CAJ is that of a ‘self-appointed body of no official standing’”.Mr Turner said that “CAJ claim to have a membership drawn from both sections of the community ‘including lawyers, students, community workers, trade unionists, unemployed people and academics’.“In reality they are [a] left of centre group with mainly nationalist support . Other executive members have dfering shades of opinion ranging from the fairly sensible to the biased and naive.”He said that the CAJ “remain firmly opposed to the use of violence to achieve political goals although there has been a sht in the leadership to a face less acceptable to the NIO.“The author of CAJ’s monthly bulletinis strongly biased and opinionated today’s CAJ is not in the Brice Dickson mould.Sammy Wilson: Theresa May’s Brexit deal is only threat to Union Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“CAJ continue to produce distorted reports that fail to paint the whole picture.“However, they remain a ‘fashionably radical’ rather than in any way sinister grouping.”A note at the top of the memo beside the name Ms Johnston, said: “A regular ‘irritant’, the CAJ is wholly disliked by the RUC, but tolerated in other quarters. They have an unfortunate disregard of matters factual.”Among many senior civil servants to whom the note was copied was Stephen Rickard, an MI officer working within the NIO who just a few months later would be killed along with  other people when the Chinook helicopter on which he was travelling crashed on the Mull of Kintyre.Three days later, the private secretary to NIO security minister Sir John Wheeler wrote: “The minister was very grateful for your submission of  February which provided advice on the membership, and an assessment of the standing, of CAJ.“Sir John has noted the submission with understanding and amusement.”The file also contains a rare note from Northern Ireland’s most senior military officer, General Officer Commanding Sir Roger Wheeler, in which he suggested to the NIO’s permanent secretary that there should be a coordinated civil service, RUC and Army response to critical CAJ and Amnesty International reports.Sir Roger said that a recent report by the CAJ had been met with a rebuttal which was jointly drafted by Stormont’s top press officer, Andy Wood, the RUC’s chief press officer, Bill McGookin, and the Army’s chief information officer in Northern Ireland, Nigel Gillies.Sir Roger welcomed the fact that in response to an Amnesty international report which was critical of the security forces the secretary of state had written back to the group “challenging Amnesty to call on the paramilitaries to stop killing the security forces”.Last night Professor McEvoy, who is no longer on CAJ’s board, said: “The NIO assessment that CAJ was and is unequivocally opposed to political violence is of course correct.“As for the other suggestions, from memory, at the time we were working on issues such as reforming the police complaints system, public order policing and the role of human rights in the emerging peace process. “Much of that work was subsequently reflected in the Patten report and Good Friday Agreement. CAJ’s line remained consistent it was the NIO that changed.”try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They stock many vegan vitamins and products.ldquoWindsor Fruit Stores in the Windsor Arcade are my favourites for amazing fruit and vegetables, I buy a lot of wonderful organic fruit and vegetables from them.ldquoThe owners Mike and Tricia are so helpful and always suggest things for me.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
