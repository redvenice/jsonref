Two months on, Qwest continues to support the local community, delivering food, medication and even treatsThe effects of the coronavirus crisis extend far beyond those who have contracted Covid-19, with lockdown taking its toll on at-risk groups in cities, towns and villages countrywide. The past eight weeks have seen volunteers and local authorities rally together to help those in need. Efforts to help include work by the private sector, which has played its own part in helping those people who need it most.For energy and services company Engie, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen its teams support councils and local communities in ways that move far beyond their normal duties. The company, which has 15 major local authority partnerships and is active on regeneration projects in more than 400 communities, has deployed staff to help deliver resources, such as welfare boxes, through several of its contracts, including Qwest – its joint-venture partnership with Cheshire west and Chester council.Qwest’s engineering team was the first to distribute these urgent boxes to residents in the area and has continued to do so, delivering non-perishable essential food items to people who are shielding from the virus. Team leader Leon Cooke and his colleagues have swapped their usual maintenance roles to help deliver the parcels, working until 10pm on the first night to make sure 69 people got the supplies they vitally needed.“We pick up the parcels from Ellesmere Port Sports Village and then deliver them around the county,” says Cooke. With support from elsewhere, the whole team isn’t always required to help, and Cooke finds his engineers vying to get involved. “We get a real sense of achievement. We’ve got nine engineers and some days we’re only asked for two, so the lads are really fighting as to who can go out. We have work on, but everyone’s working from home at the moment – only urgent jobs are getting carried out maintenance- wise – so they’re champing at the bit to help the community. We’ve developed a ‘wheel of fortune’, so if we get a phone call saying: ‘I need two engineers to help out volunteering’, I spin and pick an engineer.”Delivering parcels isn’t the only way the team has been involved, with staff driving to Manchester to collect donated supermarket food, including treats such as Easter eggs, for the council’s food hub, according to Qwest managing director Ben Cummins.Cooke and a colleague also helped one resident who had recently been discharged from hospital by carrying out vital adaptations to his home. “He was in need of some grab handles in the bathroom, so we went out and fitted them,” says Cooke.Cummins adds: “Although it’s not our normal job, Leon and his team said they’d go in and help.”Qwest has plenty of stories of staff going the extra mile to help members of the community. In one case, a team member working in the contact centre took a call from an elderly resident with a disabled son and a husband with terminal cancer who could only eat soft food. Concerned about how long they would have to wait for the right food, the employee walked to a nearby supermarket, queued up, bought the food and dropped it off, meaning the family got it within a few hours of calling.On another occasion, an employee received a call from a diabetic resident who was shielding and hadn’t eaten properly for days. He was struggling to control his blood sugar levels. The team member did the shopping and delivered the food to the man – and his dog. “Our staff know the right thing to do,” says Cummins. “They’re highly competent and caring iniduals. They don’t do the job just for the money – they do it because they care.”Delivering food parcels isn’t the only way Qwest has shifted its work to help the local community amid the coronavirus crisis. Staff have also collected medication for residents, delivered PPE, and distributed PCs to council staff working from home. Qwest has also introduced an AI chatbot for the council’s website, to direct concerned residents to external websites for advice, and is providing security staff at distribution centres and at hotels that are housing people who are homeless.The roles team members have taken up may differ from their usual jobs, but volunteering isn’t anything new for staff who devote hours to helping the community on a regular basis, says Cummins. They helped to put a roof on a community centre last year and also worked on gardens at a care home. That desire to help comes from recognising that those affected could be their own family and friends. “One of our members of staff is 78. He is shielding,” he says. “The reality is we’re helping our wider community who pay our wages. Ultimately this is our family as much as it is anybody else’s. It’s about doing the right thing and recognising that we’re all in this together,” he says.Cooke agrees, saying that while staff are aware that by volunteering to help on the frontline they may be putting themselves at risk, they have the right equipment to stay safe and ultimately want to help. “There’s a sense of pride. We have a really close team – we all look after each other. From day one everyone was volunteering and wanted to help. One of our engineers has underlying health issues, so there’s no chance of him going anywhere, but he’s concentrating on maintenance tasks. We’re really happy just to work with the community and keep everything going with regard to the parcels.”Cummins says: “The question we’ve asked ourselves several times is, if we don’t do it, who will? There’s risk in everything you do, but it’s about balancing that risk, otherwise we’d end up with people dying at home, or having to go out and get shopping and putting themselves at far greater risk than we would be. It’s proportional, it’s managed risk.“The one thing I’d say on behalf of Leon and the other staff, our cleaners for example, is sometimes these roles are undervalued and overlooked. I think what this has brought home is the importance of what they do, and the value that they bring every single day, even when people don’t notice it’s there. When it stops, suddenly everyone notices.”This type of work carried out by frontline staff such as Cooke and his team has already been recognised by Cabinet Office minister Lord Agnew, who said: “The way we have seen many large organisations and their staff move from their normal day-to-day work into projects to help tackle coronavirus has been remarkable. They have been able to turn around projects very quickly, such as delivering hundreds of new ventilators to the NHS and setting up systems to deliver much-needed resources, including food parcels and PPE equipment, to those who really need it. Their work is a tribute to their organisations and a wonderful example of their commitment to working on behalf of the public.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

In West and South Yorkshire, an academy trust executive and a food services boss stepped in to see how they could help A delivery of food arrives at a doorstep. Inside the hamper are bags of pasta, tins of tuna, tomatoes and baked beans. There are also blocks of cheese, yoghurts, milk and cereal. It’s a basic shopping list, but for the children and their families receiving this box it’s a lifeline, meaning they are able to feed themselves for the next few days.“We’ve had calls from people in tears”, Pam Knox, chief financial officer from the Waterton Academy Trust, who has been delivering the food bundles. “If they’ve not been able to get out, or are pregnant, they’ve emailed and they are so, so grateful.”The closing of schools on 21 March had a knock-on effect for some children, as, at the very baseline of support from the education system, they have a few meals a day provided for them. While some schools are still open for key workers’ children and vulnerable children, there are families in every city, town and village who will be struggling now more than ever.“We’ve got some quite high levels of deprivation in some of our communities,” says Knox. “There are some sad stories out there. So in the early days of the pandemic, we talked about how best we could support our families.”The trust - which oversees 13 schools in West and South Yorkshire - partnered with ISS Education, a company that provides facilities management services and acts as caterers for 400 schools across the UK. The problem they faced was how to get the food out to the 550 at-risk children and their families while still observing the lockdown.Right from the start, both companies were adamant that they didn’t want to resort to food vouchers. Knox says: “I personally didn’t want to do that because I didn’t feel that the food would necessarily get to the children involved. For me, it would have been the last resort.”Working alongside Linda Cregan, food services director for ISS, they trialled a packed lunch scheme for the first two weeks, where the kids would walk to school to pick up a sandwich and a yoghurt. “What that meant was that some of the children had to come to school to pick those up,” says Knox. “It simply wasn’t working – we had surplus food. They didn’t feel comfortable coming to school to pick something up every day. They really didn’t see the benefit of it.”When the prime minister announced the lockdown, he urged the public to use food delivery services. Orders for online grocery delivery across the UK jumped up. Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s sites all crashed with the strain of business, while Ocado’s CEO noted that demand spiked to 10 times the normal level. Knox and Cregan realised that home delivery might be the answer to their problem: they too could deliver a hamper of food to those who needed it the most.“We designed the hampers to give some store cupboard staples like pasta and bread, that meals like lunch or dinner could be made from,” said Cregan. “Then we made sure that there were fruit and vegetables in there.Similar to other pricier food boxes available to buy on the market, they also had the idea of including ingredient lists and recipe cards. Cregan says: “It was to give an idea of what you could do with those ingredients and to encourage children to cook with their families. It’s giving them a creative way to do that by providing the recipes that went alongside the food.”It worked, presumably as it gave families stuck at home an activity to all take part in together. “We have had children on Twitter showing us what they’d been cooking with their recipe books,” says Cregan.The free school meal allowance has been increased because of the lockdown, giving £15 for the weekly box, of which the team are currently delivering 550 a week. However, Knox notes that even with this support, there are people who fall between the cracks: “Some people aren’t on the free school meals register, but need to be. If we have spare hampers, we deliver those ourselves to people who the current crisis has left in difficulty.”Cregan adds that it takes all parts of the chain to make things happen. “It’s been lovely to see the focus on making sure vulnerable children get everything that they need, and having so many people making that happen has been a great thing.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

A total of £100,000 has already been raised and the sale of the four art masks aims to raise a further £20,000.Shrigley has produced a mask that seems to be a blur of black lines, but look carefully and there is the word “emotions” hiding among them. He said it was a nod to how difficult it is to see human emotions when people wear a mask.The artist is best known for his mordant, often deceptively simple cartoons that are providing much-needed cheer via his Twitter account. Bigger works include the gigantic bronze thumb’s-up installed on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2016.Shrigley said: “The fund will provide incredible support to emerging artists at a time when the art world entirely ground to a halt, but also the technicians, the assistants, the small galleries that do so much to support younger artists in turn.”The other masks are by Yinka Shonibare, Eddie Peake and Linder Sterling, who has revisited the album cover she co-created for the Buzzcocks’ Orgasm Addict in 1977.The masks are available through a three-week crowdfunding campaign and are priced at £35 each, or £120 for all four. They can be worn or collected for posterity.The Contemporary Art Society has been championing the collection of contemporary art and craft in the UK since 1910. Its director, Caroline Douglas, said the charity was one of the most important grassroots-level investors in the arts ecosystem.“That support is of critical importance right now, injecting investment directly where it is needed whilst helping museums become more active centres of our communities as we slowly recover from this period of lockdown.”Alistair Hudson, the director of the Whitworth and Manchester art galleries, said the rapid response fund was a wonderful thing.“Throughout this time of isolation and uncertainty, one thing that has been starkly revealed is the vital role that art plays in our lives, providing a creative stimulus and a way to assert our humanity when we need it most. In this light, museums and galleries will be needed even more than they were before when we re-enter the world to rebuild a way of life.“The CAS are a lifeline in the best of times, and now also in a moment of crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/342b76566250080b253664d3aef18acc4e956f9e/0_0_4229_6336/master/4229.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0ed0dab5fb6423937b2c9fb8a7f6cba5 1440w","title":"duncan jones on comic book sequel to moon interview","story":"The writer-director turned to comics because his next story would have been too costly to film. He and his ‘Yoda’ Alex de Campi explain their very timely projectWhen film-maker Duncan Jones decided to tell the third story in his tangentially linked science fiction trilogy, following Moon (2009) and the 2018 Netflix series Mute, he ran into a problem: the tale he wanted to tell was so vast that it would need a crippling budget to get it filmed.So Jones – the British-born, LA-based son of David Bowie and his first wife Angie – decided to tell the final part of his so-called Mooniverse trilogy, Madi, in a whole new medium: comics.“When the reality of Madi’s scale hit the budgeting process, it was clear that getting a film like that made … was going to be an uphill battle,” says Jones. “But film is just one way to tell a story. Comics are another.”Jones – perhaps a little disingenuously but charmingly so – says he’s not a big comics fan, while in the next breath describing a childhood spent reading The Trigan Empire, Marvel and DC comics, and his dad giving him graphic novels such as Black Hole by Charles Burns, Maus and When the Wind Blows (for whose animated version Bowie provided the title track). How is he not a comics fan? “I say that to be respectful of those people out there who truly are,” he says.Madi, subtitled Once Upon a Time in the Future, is set in the “Mooniverse”, the same near-future reality as Moon and Mute, but none of the stories are directly linked. Jones refers to the three stories as his “salty Cornetto trilogy”, a reference to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg’s “Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy” made up of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World’s End.Madi follows the title character, who is one of many enhanced ex-military personnel who have become indentured to the giant private corporations that run the world, working as mercenaries in order to pay for the technology that was put into their bodies during their years of service. Madi finally has enough and, after a bad final job, goes on the run.A year ago, Jones asked his 350,000 Twitter followers to recommend the best comics artists to bring his vision to life. Having assembled a roster of possible candidates, Jones needed someone who could help him adapt his movie into a comic. That led him to “my Sherpa, my Yoda, my guru”, the comic writer and novelist Alex de Campi.It was De Campi’s idea to have more than one artist illustrate what turned out to be a 260-page graphic novel, splitting it between the talent that Jones had been wowed by on Twitter. “I’ve got a lot of work and made a lot of great connections via social media but this is by far the best,” she says. “It wasn’t so much a vote thing or an internet popularity contest, but I think a few big industry friends weighed in privately to Duncan to say ‘she’s all right’ when I responded to his callout.”It took De Campi two months to adapt the script, sending it to Jones in 10-page batches. “Duncan over in LA would review the pages and tweak things and we pretty much had a constant back and forth about the script as we went,” De Campi says. “The adaptation happened very fast, because the faster I had a script ready, the more time artists had to draw.”The artists behind Madi are a who’s who of comic talent, comprising Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Ocaña, André Araújo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O’Connell, Tonči Zonjić, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Guéra, Chris Weston, Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David López and Christian Ward, with covers by Duncan Fegredo and Yuko Shimizu.On Tuesday, Jones and De Campi launched a Kickstarter to raise £40,000 to fund the project within hours, it reached £125,000. Madi will be released in a variety of hard-copy formats – not digitally – in November, with the first 19 pages already available online.Are either of them afraid that film or Netflix fans won’t follow them to a comic book? “Because of the pandemic, this is the Year Without Movies – and you’re asking me if we’re sorry we’re doing this as a graphic novel?” says De Campi. “Look, making stuff is hard. Get your work out any way you can. And who says this won’t also be a movie one day, when it’s safe to shoot again?”Jones, who is also working on a film adaptation of the 2000AD comic Rogue Trooper, is convinced that Moon and Mute fans will enjoy Madi, even if they don’t normally read comics.“Storytelling is storytelling,” he says. “From drive-in movies to stories around the campfire. If someone can engage you, they’ll paint the picture in your mind ... and the painters I’m working with are pretty exceptional.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68d3aacdec14cb8f913f0198279bdf1b99f5840f/0_30_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edee76bed44890a76efa74ab5013a948","title":"uk first car battery gigafactory amte power britishvolt","story":"AMTE Power and Britishvolt to invest up to £4bn in plant similar to Tesla facility in USTwo British startups have announced plans to invest as much as £4bn in building the UK’s first large-scale battery factory, in a move that could prove a major boost to the country’s struggling car industry.AMTE Power and Britishvolt have signed a memorandum of understanding saying they will work together on plans for a plant to make lithium ion batteries, the key component in electric cars as well as energy storage products.Lars Carlstrom, the chief executive of Britishvolt, said the companies had an ambition to build facilities producing batteries with capacity of as much as 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year, which would be roughly equivalent to the joint Tesla-Panasonic Gigafactory in Nevada. A factory of that size would create as many as 4,000 jobs, he said.The global automotive industry is racing to secure supplies of lithium ion batteries as manufacturers seek to meet growing demand for electric cars as well as government regulations that limit carbon dioxide exhaust emissions.However, the lack of large-scale battery manufacturing facilities in the UK has raised fears over the future of the country’s automotive industry, including from the Jaguar Land Rover boss, Ralf Speth. Transport costs mean that securing a battery supply close to car assembly plants is attractive for carmakers.The government-backed Faraday Institution estimates 130 GWh of annual capacity will be required by 2040 if the UK is to retain a large automotive sector.The UK recently lost out on a major investment in battery production by Tesla. Elon Musk, the US electric carmaker’s chief executive, blamed Brexit uncertainty for his decision to choose Berlin over a British location. Other battery producers such as Sweden’s Northvolt, South Korea’s LG Chem and China’s CATL have built factories in EU countries.Carlstrom said the UK’s struggles with Brexit had provided an opportunity for the company to approach the market, with other companies unwilling to invest despite the expected demand for batteries from UK car factories.European and UK carmakers have tended to import battery cells, which are then assembled into packs to go in cars, from China and South Korea. However, carmakers such as the Vauxhall owner, Peugeot, have recognised an increasing need to secure a supply of cells closer to home.Securing investment in a UK gigafactory has been a top priority for the government’s automotive industry officials. The government-backed Advanced Propulsion Centre orchestrated the tie-up between two startups.AMTE Power, which was founded in 2013, already runs a small facility in Thurso, northern Scotland, and is looking at sites in Teesside and Dundee for a larger plant capable of 1GWh a year. AMTE, led by the chief executive, Kevin Brundish, focuses on specialist markets such as high-performance cars.Britishvolt is looking at five locations for a larger plant with an annual capacity of 10GWh of batteries aimed at mass-market cars, with the possibility of adding another 20GWh after that. Britishvolt expects to raise the first £1.2bn of funds in the next year, after receiving initial backing from Scandinavian and Middle Eastern investors.The company is confident it can raise funds despite the looming coronavirus recession, as investors look for green investment opportunities. Later stages of building could focus on different technologies, such as solid-state batteries, as development continues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/407877a71b177b46286c79b53c76bb6ad5c58958/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=318d0f50d8bfcdf136f6466deb6f9073","title":"uk sells government bond with negative yield for first time coronavirus","story":"Governor says all options are open after UK sells first ever bond with negative yieldThe Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has paved the way for negative interest rates in a dramatic move that illustrates concerns inside the central bank that the impact of the coronavirus lockdown will be longer and deeper than expected.Bailey said central bank officials were actively considering all options to help see the economy through a deep recession and told MPs that it would be “foolish” to rule out cutting the cost of borrowing to below zero.The move came after Britain sold a government bond with a negative yield for the first time.A negative yield effectively means investors have to pay to lend money to fund the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In searching for a safe haven for their money they bought gilts knowing they would get back less than they paid for them when the bonds mature in three years’ time.However, the deepening crisis has persuaded the Bank that it needs to consider all tools available to make credit cheaper for embattled businesses and households.The move would be unprecedented in the Bank’s 325-year history and would leave only the US Federal Reserve among major central banks to rule out negative rates.Japan’s central bank and the European Central Bank, which sets interest rates for the 19-member eurozone, have already adopted negative interest rates to stimulate borrowing and discourage saving.Bailey, who took over from Mark Carney in March, said the Bank was keeping the outlook for how low UK rates could go – and other monetary policy tools available – under “active review”.“We do not rule things out as a matter of principle. That would be a foolish thing to do. But that doesn’t mean we rule things in either.”He said the Bank believed the benefits weaken as rates approach zero and could even be “counterproductive” when negative.Policymakers are “looking carefully” at the experience of other central banks that have cut rates into negative territory, he said, adding that the reviews were “mixed”.After the 2008 banking crash, the Bank refused to adopt negative rates, arguing that building societies and other financial institutions would become unprofitable and could go bust if they were forced to pay to keep funds with the central bank.It is understood that officials remain concerned that negative rates would undermine the profitability of the banking and building society sector, though substantial increases in reserves of the last 10 years would provide a cushion, at least in the short term.The DMO is holding frequent gilt auctions to pay for the extra government borrowing resulting from the effective shutdown of the economy.Despite concerns that the government would have to offer higher yields to investors to persuade them to finance the highest borrowing in peacetime, demand for gilts has been strong.According to the DMO, bids for the July 2023 gilt were worth £8.1bn – more than double the £3.75bn on offer.Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Société Général, said it would be a bad idea for the Bank to lower rates below zero. “The chancellor has dramatically increased government borrowing and the Bank of England is buying the economy time by mopping most of it up,” he said. “How on earth does it make sense to even consider adding negative rates to the mix?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5db1e65a532b74e6e96c9be3e7504d9ce48d9dff/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2dd7edf7b4142037f492851f5166d87","title":"we missed the sweet and sour sauce joy as mcdonalds drive throughs reopen","story":"Thirty-three branches in London and south-east England opened for drive-through Word spread fast that the McDonald’s drive-through at Bushey, near Watford in Hertfordshire, was on the list of Golden Arches restaurants that had reopened after eight weeks, and the queue of customers craving Big Macs and Happy Meals began building rapidly. By 1pm, two hours after it reopened, a line of about 40 vehicles meant an hour-long roadside wait for burger fans.The branch is among 33 outlets the fast food chain has reopened for drive-through only in London and south-east England as it eases back into business following the loosening of lockdown restrictions.McDonald’s and other fast food chains including Burger King, KFC and Nando’s are trialling a gradual reopening of restaurants to allow staff to get used to new safety measures and practise physical distancing inside.In Bushey, sisters Casey and Alycia Levy, aged 18 and 20, had bought burgers, chicken nuggets and cold drinks as a surprise for their grandparents, who have been isolating for 11 weeks. “They’ve been at home since 1 March, so we wanted to cheer them up,” Alycia said.Matthew Cohen had brought his children Dylan, 7, and Summer, 11, for lunch. “We’ve been missing the sweet and sour sauce with our chicken nuggets,” Cohen said. The family usually visit the drive-through weekly, and had a longer wait than usual, because only one lane was open, but did not find a radical change in the experience.The changes in restaurant operations will be more noticeable for the staff. They now have their temperatures checked when they arrive for a shift, and will be given protective equipment including masks and gloves. They are also protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their fellow workers inside the restaurant’s kitchen.As a McDonald’s employee – his face covered with a face mask and wearing a hi-vis vest – marshalled the queue of cars, other staff members walked the line of vehicles to tell customers they were serving only a limited menu. Clients were asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending was capped at £25 per vehicle.The details of which branches were reopening were kept secret until just 45 minutes before the first customers were served, as McDonald’s tried to avoid a rerun of its experience in France and Switzerland. When drive-throughs were reopened there, the first locations were announced well in advance, leading to queues of up to seven hours.Many customers at Bushey had heard about the reopening on social media and had brought their children for a trip out to buy a meal.By lunchtime, so many vehicles were queueing for the Bushey branch that they were starting to disrupt traffic on the adjoining A41, and the restaurant’s franchise owner and some of his staff enlisted the help of a nearby highway maintenance crew to cordon off part of the road, creating a one-way system.Despite almost two months passing since the government introduced lockdown measures and the closure of seating spaces in all restaurants, some customers were still unsure how to behave. Having ordered burgers from their car window, one mother and son were disappointed not to be able to eat their lunch at a sunny table outside.The fast food chain said it had informed police forces, local authorities and the highways agency in all places where it was due to reopen.

Yet we’re now in a position where potentially the final consent decision may not be known until April next year,” Davey said.“Delays on this scale influence plans and investment decisions, send the wrong signal to the offshore wind sector as a whole, and call into question Britain’s commitment to acting quickly to reduce emissions.” The International Energy Agency said global renewable energy growth is likely to slow this year for the first time in 20 years, unless governments make decisions in the next months which support renewable energy to boost economics growth while tackling the climate crisis.The International Renewable Energy Agency said last month that globally, renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring GDP gains of almost $100tn (£80tn) between now and 2050, compared with business as usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac61c94c4cb5321daef12f99ac894d0ee70d048/0_105_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bf95512a6cac9abe58126eae7fe264c","title":"uk government pandemic","story":"We were second in the world for preparedness. Then Boris Johnson et al deliberately de-prepared usWe are trapped in a long, dark tunnel, all of whose known exits are blocked. There is no plausible route out of the UK’s coronavirus crisis that does not involve mass suffering and death. If, as some newspapers and Conservative MPs insist, the government eases the lockdown while the pandemic is still raging, the eventual death toll could be several times greater than today’s. If it doesn’t, and we spend all the warm months of the year in confinement, the impact on our mental and physical health, jobs and relationships could be catastrophic.We have been told repeatedly that the UK was unprepared for this pandemic. This is untrue. The UK was prepared, but then it de-prepared. Last year, the Global Health Security Index ranked this nation second in the world for pandemic readiness, while the US was first. Broadly speaking, in both nations the necessary systems were in place. Our governments chose not to use them.The climate modeller James Annan has used his analytical methods to show what would have happened if the UK government had imposed its lockdown a week earlier. Starting it on 16 March, rather than 23 March, his modelling suggests, would by now have saved around 30,000 lives, reducing the rate of illness and death from coronavirus roughly by a factor of five.But even 16 March would have been extraordinarily late. We now know that government ministers were told on 11 February that the virus could be catastrophic, and decisive action was urgently required. Instead, Boris Johnson told us to wash our hands and “go about our normal daily lives”.Had the government acted in February, we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been, as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment: weighing South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand against the UK, the US and Brazil. South Korea did everything the UK government could have done, but refused to implement. Its death toll so far: 263. It still has an occasional cluster of infection, which it promptly contains. By contrast, the entire UK is now a cluster of infection.While other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals, in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the UK’s lockdown, 18 million people arrived on these shores, of whom only 273 were quarantined. Even after the lockdown was announced, 95,000 people entered the UK without additional restrictions. In fact, on 13 March, the UK stood down even its own guidance, which had gently requested travellers from Italy and China to self-isolate. This decision, taken as other nations were stepping up their controls, seems baffling.Similarly, on 12 March, Johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking. A week later, the status of the pandemic was lowered, which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals, and could shift infectious patients into non-specialist care. Again, there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision.Exercise Cygnus, a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016, found that the impacts in care homes would be catastrophic unless new measures were put in place. The government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly. If this is correct, by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes, while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to move freely within and between them, it knowingly breached its own protocols. Tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection.In other words, none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity. They are de-preparations, conscious decisions not to act. They start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common: a refusal to frontload the costs. This refusal is common in countries whose governments fetishise what we call “the market”: the euphemism we use for the power of money.Johnson’s government, like that of Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, represents a particular kind of economic interest. For years politicians of their stripe have been in conflict with people who perform useful services: nurses, teachers, care workers and the other low-paid people who keep our lives ticking, whose attempts to organise and secure better pay and conditions are demonised by ministers and in the media.This political conflict is always fought on behalf of the same group: those who extract wealth. The war against utility is necessary if you want to privatise public services, granting lucrative monopolies or fire sales of public assets to friends in the private sector. It’s necessary if you want to hold down public sector pay and the minimum wage, cutting taxes and bills for the same funders and lobbyists. It is necessary if corporations are to be allowed to outsource and offshore their workforces, and wealthy people can offshore their income and assets.The interests of wealth extractors are, by definition, short term. They ert money that might otherwise have been used for investment into idends and share buybacks. They dump costs that corporations should legitimately bear on to society in general, in the form of pollution (the car and road lobbies) or public health disasters (soft drinks and junk food producers). They siphon money out of an enterprise or a nation as quickly as possible, before the tax authorities, regulators or legislators catch up.Years of experience have shown that it is much cheaper to make political donations, employ lobbyists and invest in public relations than to change lucrative but harmful commercial policies. Working through the billionaire press and political systems that are highly vulnerable to capture by money, in the UK, US and Brazil they have helped ensure that cavalier and reckless people are elected. Their chosen representatives have an almost instinctive aversion to investment, to carrying a cost today that could be deferred, delayed or dumped on someone else.It’s not that any of these interests – whether the Daily Mail or the US oil companies – want coronavirus to spread. It’s that the approach that has proved so disastrous in addressing the pandemic has been highly effective, from the lobbyists’ point of view, when applied to other issues: delaying and frustrating action to prevent climate breakdown pollution the obesity crisis inequality unaffordable rent and the many other plagues spread by corporate and billionaire power.Thanks in large part to their influence, we have governments that fail to protect the public interest, by design. This is the tunnel. This is why the exits are closed. This is why we will struggle to emerge.• The main image was changed on 20 May 2020 to better reflect the text of the article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f10fa5e828b25cde6e3565e0761b63954974458/0_170_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dc48d8e1e178370b11c08d14e6a9fd","title":"british schools science children education testing tracing","story":"We need to get children back into education, but a locally managed approach using testing and tracing is the only wayThe big debate over the past few days has been whether it’s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.That scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don’t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can’t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.Given the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren’t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils – because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities – or to focus on older pupils – because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead – is a political one.Flexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.Given the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented – and then only if “test, trace, isolate”, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.The tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and “crunched the curve” are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what’s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government’s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it’s helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain.Two of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes as “the moral intuitions”, the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers placed more emphasis on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask “will this cause harm?”, whereas leavers would be inclined to ask “will something restrict our freedom?”.This emphasis on careharm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions ide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the careharm reasoning is stronger among women. This might help to explain the gender difference in concern around coronavirus, and why male and female leaders have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with vaccine hesitancy, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine.We might disagree with the values underlying people’s political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side – not because they don’t have good ideas, but simply because they are in the “other” camp.In other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more persuasive communication. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues have argued that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security.Finding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a “nudge”. The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let’s set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity.Chicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the concept of nudge as a reconciliation between “paternalistic” state intervention and the liberty of the inidual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people’s environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important, but are still more likely to do so if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital.As we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated. Governments have a huge role to play in structuring our daily environments to make it easy to engage in the behaviours we need to engage in. Telling people to follow “common sense” is likely to prove a lot less effective than making masks easily available, or making hand sanitisers more widespread in public buildings.There is no quick fix to Get Corona Done. However, behavioural science can help create new habits to slow the rate of infection until a vaccine is created – and a little bit of understanding of the values behind people’s beliefs will go a long way to avoid the spread of further ision.• Lee de Wit is a lecturer in political psychology at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80cbe536b81df3ff74ed1b22d5aa8dfa095d14a3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007dd3a6eff53c8dc8d4ab53aff9524d","title":"post coronavirus uk alliances stand up china us","story":"Covid-19 has seen China supplant the US in the global power league. Alliances are now crucial to reject the superpower’s bullyingAmid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred. But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19. A lot of the speculation about the post-coronavirus political world is plain fanciful. But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic’s role in boosting the global heft of China.The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic. But when the Obama administration’s US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee to assess Covid-19’s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China’s rise.Covid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the “belt and road” strategies, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China’s “wolf-warrior” diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump’s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.As the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump’s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China’s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.At this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power’s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government’s “integrated review” of Britain’s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain’s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.Covid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since Tony Blair could write that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.But it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic “long game” with China that would give Britain greater political leverage “to bring China into the rules-based international system – through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.” Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain’s leverage in that or any other global order?Johnson’s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach – an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war – that the American diplomat George Kennan crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen – and partly sees itself – as an alliance breaker.China in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.Yet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman Stephen Kinnock made clear this week. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.The answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52a28733c248f0a7008ee04539dc2a439abb8d44/0_0_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4001c65bd751c3e6b7dcc9bd2e5d9ec7","title":"summer holiday no 10 coronavirus","story":"With coronavirus kiboshing holidays abroad, the government is praying the public will be happy with Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beachWhen coronavirus first arrived in Britain, ministers initially placed their hopes on the summer months offering relief from the pandemic. The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.That wasn’t to be. Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has limited effect on Covid-19’s spread. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.With the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars – and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and Italy and Spain aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.Next month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a “devastating” impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.However, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the “slow and steady” path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.Even if talks of “air bridges” – allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece – come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.As well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won’t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.As a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. “If the R number rises in these countries as a result, we’ll be praised for our response – if it doesn’t, we might start to get some heat,” explains one government figure.The great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. “If it rains, we’re fucked,” says one rather blunt Tory MP.“Britain’s going to look like the 1940s this summer,” predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we’re lucky, drive-in cinemas.Talks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don’t live with.While restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won’t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people – whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.The first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping – if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season – not just the typical high season of peak summer months – given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.Ministers are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it’s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots – it could also be what’s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies – with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there’s a sense that “common sense” will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.However, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bea06a60a8d38ba94f548f072c334423edf9be54/0_168_5186_3112/master/5186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a31210ff9cb7c0993aa5813245e6d2","title":"the guardian view on uk theatre on the brink","story":"The brilliant creativity of British theatre must be safeguarded – and not just the great national institutionsTheatre has brave new thinking in its bones.

Put in economic terms, that means selling a lot of tickets to an audience sitting indoors, very near to each other. Theatres may not be able to reopen fully till at least much later this year, and possibly 2021.With no income coming in, the Globe and the Old Vic in London have sent out warning signals that they are weeks from collapse.

This week, the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh announced all jobs are at risk of redundancy.Emergency funding from national arts councils varies among the four nations, but in England, where £160m is being spent by Arts Council England across the board (with £20m going to iniduals artists), organisations will survive only until September at best. And the people who make theatre – actors and directors and writers, but also technicians, composers, designers, musicians, specialist set builders, prop and costume makers – are for the large part freelancers whose livelihoods are, at the best of times, fragile, and have now disappeared. Many have fallen through the gaps of the government help offered to the self-employed.The UK and devolved governments must step in. But it is crucial that any solution protects the whole of British theatre, an ecology through which the smallest experimental fringe company is connected by innumerable threads to the most internationally famous institutions. Safeguarding the most obviously prominent, often London-based organisations for the sake of national prestige would make no sense – the whole network is interdependent. It would also be a political miscalculation: the theatres of the “red wall” constituencies of the Midlands and northern England must not be left behind – nor the small, nimble organisations at the grassroots, which provide the real energy fuelling British theatre.A great irony is that theatre companies have, over the past weeks, made extraordinary theatre work available online, to the delight and solace of audiences. The internet is brimming with material – from something as intimate as Andrew Scott’s spellbinding performance of Simon Stephens’ monologue Sea Wall, to Emma Rice’s joyous adaptation of Angela Carter’s Wise Children. The exuberance, the creativity, the energy of all this is what Britain stands to lose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e29992dd38afb9b16a8f182f46e2f9b5a2fa73c/0_81_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6280b1349e8caab3c7dd3198ebd60d8c","title":"the perfect vegan sausages from a dry mix what other meat free joys of the 70s did i miss","story":"No more Linda McCartneys in our house: I’ll be making my own banging bangers from now on – from a powderI stopped eating meat five and a half years ago after getting close to a lamb in Turkey. I only spent a few minutes with this lamb, whose name, translated, was Courage. But, as these were the closing minutes of the poor lamb’s life, the bond grew very strong, very quickly, before being severed by the knife of its killer. Perhaps, though, the bond is actually as strong as ever, given that I think about him most days.Until that point in my life, I had been a voracious meat-eater. Most evenings, my dinner table resembled Fred Flintstone’s. I am no massive animal rights campaigner. I am quite happy to sit with people who are eating meat, neither do I mind cooking flesh for friends and family if that’s what they want. I fear that makes me the Centrist Dad of vegetarianism. My logic is merely that, as I happen to be able to feed myself very well without any animals dying, I think it is the right thing to do.My conversion seemed to coincide with the moment that plant-only eating passed the tipping point into the mainstream. It turned out that all manner of perfectly good meat substitutes were available in supermarkets, and the range has grown markedly since. All of which makes me feel a bit like a Leicester City fan who only started supporting the club the year they won the Premier League. Fans of other teams have a chant for people like that, to the tune of Bread of Heaven: “Where were you when you were shit?”I would not blame veteran plant-eaters for chanting something similar at me: where were you when vegetarian food was shit? It doesn’t scan as well, but it is a fair question. My answer is that I am beginning to wonder if missing out on the pre-Linda McCartney era was my loss. The more I taste of it, the more I like. A great example is something I had never heard of until last week: Sosmix. This miracle dry mixture is apparently something every 20th-century vegetarian was familiar with.I was bought some last week, and I’ve neither talked of, nor cooked, anything else since. What a miracle has unfolded before me. For the carnivores and fellow new plant-eaters among you, I should say it is a mix of dry ingredients roughly resembling fine muesli. You mix 160g of it with 250ml of water, leave it for five minutes, and then fashion it into sausages. It then says to cook them as normal but, disbelieving it could be this simple, I messed around wrapping them in foil and steaming them for an hour first. I had read somewhere this helps firm up homemade plant sausages. I have since found that even this isn’t necessary with Sosmix.Either way, as my daughters probably wouldn’t say, the resulting bangers are banging. My favourites, until now, have been Plant Pioneers, Quorn or Linda McCartney. But from now on they are strangers to me, because these are right up there. So cheap, too! A kilo of Sosmix costs a tenner, which is enough to make more than 40 sausages. And oh the fun I’ve had flavouring them! Dried mixed herbs worked well, as did my first attempt at a spicier sausage: chilli powder, paprika and cumin. This weekend, I’m planning three new versions featuring sage and onion, smoked tomato and curry.Unaccountably, Sosmix is quite hard to find. You can only buy it online, and it looks like the manufacturer has changed hands a few times, leading to some dark warnings about being sure to buy the original. It is well worth it. I have enough to keep us in vegan sausages until Christmas, when I hope Santa will bring me some more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1dc4b517850bfbb652305662b4da6a2bb5364cd/0_278_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea49bdbf4e3abdeaafa49bf64da608f1","title":"students are you thinking of deferring your entry to university this year","story":"We would like to hear from students who are looking to start their first year at university in SeptemberCambridge University has decided to move all “face-to-face lectures” online for the full 2020-21 academic year.We want to hear from prospective first year students who are thinking of postponing their entry to university this year.Are you thinking of deferring entry or thinking about waiting a year?

Now, as a deep recession bites, conservation funding is likely to be further hit as donors and philanthropic funders channel money towards human health.During the austerity of the 2010s, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) suffered bigger cuts than any other department. Is there any reason to expect anything different this time around?Many environmentalists hope there is. The eight-week experience of lockdown has transformed public attitudes towards local green spaces, neighbourhood nature and wild species. Conservation charities are determined to mobilise this new interest.“We’re definitely in an unfrozen moment with being connected to nature,” said Beccy Speight, chief executive of the RSPB. “There’s this shift from consumer to citizen and all that goes with that in terms of community, place and sense of where you fit in the natural world and the global world. There’s a real opportunity to open that door which is tremendously exciting.”NGOs such as the Wildlife Trusts, with its popular #30dayswild campaign in June, whereby people pledge to undertake “random acts of wildness” each day, are encouraging public engagement in nature by showing its physical and mental health benefits. This will be key to ensuring that nature is seen as relevant by policymakers as society adapts to the coronavirus world.“Nature conservation charities need to be part of the green recovery,” said Julie Williams, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation. “It’s vital charities are welcomed into a post-Covid-19 recovery programme fully funded by a government that grasps that interest in nature which people are discovering. Could we work in greater partnership with Public Health England and the NHS to help with that health and wellbeing agenda which will be so important as we start to recover?”Butterfly Conservation and the RSPB are also developing more projects to boost urban wildlife, while the very white conservation sector is acutely aware it needs to become more erse to encourage a more widespread range of supporters.Transformed public appreciation for nature and green space may push government policy, but conservationists know their ability to reverse decades of bioersity losses ultimately depends on funding.The impact of austerity, according to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of Buglife, is evident in cash-strapped government agencies such as Natural England and the Environment Agency. “Statutory agencies are no longer delivering even a minimally acceptable service,” said Shardlow.Although the government announced on Monday a £15m boost for Natural England this year, it will only make up a small amount of the cuts to the body over the past decade, during which funding dropped from £265m in 2008-2009 to a low of £86.5m in 2019-20. The key, says Shardlow, is to ensure the countryside is restored so it can perform ecological functions again – prevent flooding, for instance, and become rich once more in pollinators and other insects that provide natural pest control. The most cost-effective method is wildlife corridors so species can move through the landscape when challenged by climate change.Even in a deep recession, there is money. Under the EU, British farming received £3.4bn each year. The post-Brexit farm subsidy, the Environmental Land Management scheme, is still being developed. If reality matches its vision – public money not for unsustainable farming practices but for public goods, such as preventing flooding, improving soils or boosting bioersity – nature conservation could be transformed.“A lot of the £3.4bn does need to go to bioersity and the environment,” said Shardlow, who hopes that the new public mood will be matched by increased determination within Defra to resist further cuts.“Defra were very compliant last time,” said Shardlow. “I hope they’ve learned their lesson.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf64a2273c23896b6449c5e1ea542a17629482d4/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c028f9a1bc0cb45b643978a1d057eb2e","title":"relax to the sounds of british wildlife","story":"Our interactive takes you on an audiovisual journey through a lush forest across the course of a dayAs the coronavirus crisis and lockdown still thwart most of our social plans, many of us are looking to escape feelings of cabin fever and the perennial cycle of bad news by reconnecting with nature.Perhaps you are taking more notice of your natural surroundings these days, or you have seen animals move into the spaces that humans have vacated.But what if you could enjoy some of that natural beauty from the safety of your home?Our interactive experience takes you on a journey through a lush forest in spring and lets you listen to the sounds of iconic British wildlife. The samples were collected by prolific wildlife recordist Lawrence Shove in the 1960s and 1970s and provided to the  by the British Library. This interactive is best experienced with your sound on. As we wake up to an early start around sunrise, many birds are already up and singing at full throat to stake off their territory and attract potential mates.The nightingale likes to hide in thick brush when delivering its powerful song. It can be heard between April and June and is most active at dawn and dusk.The robin is a pugnacious little bird that will try to maintain its territory throughout the year.Fallow deer often stalk the forest at dawn before lying down to ruminate during the day. They give off powerful bellows to establish dominance or signal alarm. Around midday, the forest gets quieter as birds and other small animals are cautious not to attract the attention of predators. But not all animals fall silent … The woodpecker’s distinctive drumming can often be heard during the day. The woodpecker uses its drumming like other birds use their song: to attract mates, defend a territory or summon help.The great tit is known for its vast repertoire of short calls.The grey squirrel spends much of the day scavenging for nuts, fruit and fungi. It will give off loud alarm calls when spotting a predator. As the sun goes down, more animals can be heard stirring in the undergrowth again.  The red fox is an extremely adaptive species not afraid of exploring gardens or farmland. Its diet includes rodents, insects, fruit and vegetables – and sometimes scraps found in the garbage. The elusive pine marten is a close relative of the weasel and critically endangered in England and Wales. It is a stealthy, acrobatic hunter that likes to venture out at dusk. The mole is active for about four hours at a time and then rests for a similar amount of time. It makes shrill chirping noises when alarmed. Many animals awake only after nightfall to move or hunt under cover of darkness. The badger emerges from its underground home after dusk to feed on worms, birds’ eggs or small animals. It is a highly social animal and communicates through chortling sounds. The tawny owl glides almost soundlessly through the night as it looks for prey. The male gives off an eerie hoot when attempting to court a nearby female. Finally, we hear a hedgehog snuffling as it moves through the undergrowth. The hedgehog can also become surprisingly noisy during its lengthy mating ritual. If you enjoyed this interactive, you might find that some of these animals live right on your doorstep.If you decide to exercise outdoors, remember that the government’s coronavirus advice is to stay at home as much as possible. The Welsh and Scottish governments are urging the public to avoid all unnecessary travel. National park authorities in England are telling people not to rush back to beauty spots."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea8a1746bb8c8c155fc0f2179a72e6ba2b9a3ba/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4ac5fc44c1ddf3264c9e223e136b3e9","title":"kim kardashian wests face masks provoke controversy","story":"The reality star’s non-medical masks, launched through her shapewear company, suggest the line between fashion and necessity is becoming increasingly blurredThe reality TV star Kim Kardashian West is the latest designer to capitalise on the coronavirus crisis by launching a line of face masks – and has sparked a race row in the process.Launched over the weekend under the celebrity’s shapewear label, Skims, the non-medical seamless masks come in five skin tones and reportedly sold out in less than 30 minutes. There is now a waiting list for them.But their runaway success came hand in hand with accusations of “casual racism”, according to some on social media, who pointed out that one of the masks was not the right nude shade for a black model. The Skims site has now changed the model and the mask she wears. Skims had not responded to the ’s request for comment at time of publication.Skims announced that it would donate 10,000 masks to various local relief charities in Los Angeles, where wearing a mask is mandatory if physical distancing is not possible. This public act of generosity has been widely reported, alongside news of sales.A host of other fashion brands have responded to the coronavirus pandemic by rearranging their supply chains to manufacture masks and other pieces of personal protective equipment, in many cases not for profit. At the same time, some large profit-making companies have been accused of “coronawashing” or using the pandemic as a public relations vehicle. Others, such as ASOS and Boohoo, have faced criticism for profiteering from the crisis by making “fashion masks” in leopard and paisley prints that offer little or no proven protection.The Skims masks cost $8 each, and are available in colours named sand, clay, sienna, cocoa and onyx. Given that the masks are “non-medical” – the website cautions that the mask is “not a respirator and will not eliminate the risk of contracting disease or infection” – wearing them would appear to be as much about style as pandemic precaution.There is concern that should mask-wearing become mandatory, this line between necessity and fashion statement is going to blur, and this arm of the industry will get bigger. The masks currently sit under “accessory” on the shapewear label’s site."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a1361e5ffb5bd7bbf31ad561e15a05d069c8aba/0_398_3492_2095/master/3492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37fcae2fb3652674e9ac3567144a2c41","title":"we cant be silent how fashion is speaking up about covid racism","story":"Asian American designers such as Phillip Lim and Prabal Gurung are using their clothes to fight against the rising tide of corona-related xenophobia and help the relief effort“The upturn of violence and discrimination really hit way too close to home for all of us,” says the US designer Phillip Lim. “When we see people who look like us, our friends and family members, colleagues being attacked, we can’t be silent.”Lim’s 3.1 Phillip Lim label and Prabal Gurung are among the fashion brands contributing clothing, including t-shirts and hats, with proceeds going to the All Americans Movement, a campaign to help those from marginalised communities who have been affected by Covid-19.“It’s a cross-cultural movement, which reinforces the idea that there are many different ways to be American,” says Gurung, the Nepalese-American fashion designer who is based in New York. “It is an idea: a confluence of different cultures, communities and dreams. When different minority groups stand up and stand together, there is an astounding level of support that can change the tides for a more equitable and peaceful future.”It is a potent message, in the climate of racially based Covid incidents and Donald Trump labelling the pandemic the “Chinese virus”. “Assigning a race to this virus is exactly the type of misinformation we have to fight against to ensure we are well informed,” says Gurung. Lim agrees that the incendiary language around Covid is having a toxic effect. “It is frustrating to watch the leaders of this country blatantly gaslight the American public with this type of xenophobic rhetoric,” he says.“I genuinely believe that most people want to do good,” says Gurung. “That said, I was not surprised by the racism. While I see the incredible beauty of this country, I have always been aware of the cracks in its foundation and the systemic racism that pulses under the surface.”Gurung has been political in his work before. He sent models down the runway with statement T-shirts featuring slogans such as “The future is female” and “Our bodies, our choices, our power” and “I am an immigrant”. He stopped his 10th anniversary New York fashion week show being held at Hudson Yards when he found out that the owner hosted a Trump fundraiser. Provocatively, in the era of Trump’s immigration ban, his SpringSummer 20 show featured a erse cast of models wearing prom-like sashes asking: “Who gets to be American?”.He said the idea for the collection came to him while he was in a business meeting. “I was sitting across from a group of businessmen, telling them about my goal to redefine the Americana aesthetic, and one of them said: ‘You don’t look American, so how can you define what America is?’” He said this exchange, along with Time magazine’s Who Gets To Be American cover, set off the central idea for the collection.“The sashes were a powerful visual moment, with all these erse models from all over the world representing the different possible identities and stories of living the American dream,” he says, adding that the collection was about “questioning who gets to claim that identity in today’s climate”.This political moment in fashion also marks a generational shift. “In Asian culture, our parents tell us to keep our heads down,” says Lim. “Don’t make problems and ignore racism so that it will just go away it’s so ingrained in our subconscious as a means of survival. In our current situation, that mentality has the opposite effect. Being quiet strips away your right for a voice and it takes away the opportunity to be seen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68e52f4e6e5bfc30d8b452092ffdc8368b31902a/145_69_1467_881/master/1467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20669199e38db463fbf519d2e7f1cf29","title":"edge of extinction review","story":"Some well-crafted action scenes are thwarted by a stilted script in Andrew Gilbert’s plodding post-apocalyptic thriller This post-apocalyptic survivalist thriller, set in rural Britain, is both violent and depressing, with some iffy line-readings, weird script moments and untied plot strands. It isn’t badly shot by any means, with one or two effective action scenes and interesting use of remote locations, but it takes two ploddingly long hours to tell a cumbersomely inflated and often dull story, which even at the finish line has to be wound up pretty arbitrarily.We are in a lawless, chaotic land where food, water and shelter are grimly scarce. A lone inidual (Luke Hobson), haunted by his tragic past, makes common cause with a young woman (Georgie Smibert) and a desperate, angry man (Chris Kaye) to win out against a terrifying band of marauding cannibals and rapists, led by a brutal figure known as The Beast (Bryn Hodgen). They also get help from a couple, played by Nicholas Chambers and Susan Lee Burton who have their own reasons for fearing and hating these evil monsters.The strangest moment comes when when Smibert’s character is briefly imprisoned as a sex slave by The Beast, and she briefly befriends another young woman chained up for the same purpose. Later, the couple reveal their daughter was taken and could still be in The Beast’s compound. Did these two plot points have a relationship in earlier script drafts? The way they played out here is disconcerting and inconclusive.We are of course heading for a monumentally horrible, medieval-style bloodbath, and the film delivers on that score, but the dialogue scenes are leaden and it is impossible to feel any sympathy or interest in anyone here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c388f4676382a419f25c94f991070b47ead27f07/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29ffb5aae9ed9a6938063dac9b8c0a19","title":"peter gallagher one of the most toxic things in the world is success","story":"The actor on 40 years in show business, why he channelled Donald Trump in American Beauty – and having a face that makes directors sickThe director Robert Altman used to tell Peter Gallagher, the suave star of his 1992 movie The Player: “Gallagher, you’re so good-looking it makes me sick.” To hear Gallagher impersonating the gruff auteur, it was not quite a compliment. But he was used to that.During a heated rehearsal for The Real Thing, Gallagher’s breakout role on Broadway at the age of 29, another director, Mike Nichols, admitted to not being able to stand the sight of him. “And we were close!” says Gallagher cheerfully, speaking over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. He responded by growing an “awful white goatee” until Nichols pleaded for him to shave.Critiques of Gallagher’s performance often linger on his looks. They seem integral to the cocksure ne’er-do-wells he plays: from a vengeful spouse in Altman’s Short Cuts, to a lawyer sleeping with his wife’s sister in Sex, Lies and Videotape, to the braggadocious “real estate king” in American Beauty. Altman said he cast Gallagher as a shortcut to character, just his face communicating “handsome, vain, sleazy”.Even at 64, Gallagher continues to play bad guys: an absent father in the sitcom New Girl, a three-time orcee and white-collar criminal in Netflix’s Grace and Frankie. “It has a lot to do with how I look,” he agrees. “When I was younger, I had the kind of face that if I saw me walking down the street, I’d say: ‘What an asshole! Look at that rich kid who’s had everything handed to him! Fuck him!’”Yet Gallagher has little in common with his privileged parts. From working-class Irish-Catholic stock, he carved out a 40-year career in show business by “showing up”, he says. “The only thing I know is you’ve got to be willing to work harder than everybody else.” Even now, quarantining at home, Gallagher is practising singing daily, so as to “not completely go to seed”.The character he seems most like is Sandy Cohen, the statesmanly patriarch of the 00s teen-dramedy The OC, one of television’s greatest-ever dads. “After Bill Cosby fell a few spots …” he jokes drily. As a father, to film-maker James and musician Kathryn, Gallagher says: “I try to be Sandy Cohen. I never, ever wanted my kids to see me angry, because I know that anger just stops a kid. It chokes everything off.”Gallagher’s own childhood was characterised by that emotional instability. “The impression was we were always sort of living on the edge.” He was born in New York City in 1955, the unplanned youngest of three. He was close to his mother, a bacteriologist, but for much of his childhood she suffered from social anxiety and depression, which he connects to her parents’ experience of emigrating to the US from Ireland. “She would be unable to get out of bed, and I had to take care of her.”Gallagher’s parents, both of whom are dead, fought constantly. He remembers, at age six, seeing the family’s brand-new television sailing through the air. “I used to pray for them to get orced, it was just so noisy sometimes.”Later, as an adult, he saw the love between them, and “that there was grace to be maybe had, if you stayed the course”. That has informed his own marriage, to Paula Harwood, a former producer turned interior designer, whom he met in his first year at Tufts University in Massachusetts. This month they mark their 37th wedding anniversary, which is, says Gallagher, “embarrassing for Hollywood”.But his relationship with his father – a second world war veteran and advertising executive – casts a long shadow. Gallagher describes a distant, dismissive figure. “I would try my whole life to reach him, just to get him to respond to me. ‘Dad, what were you in the war?’ ‘A general. Now go clean the gutters.’ ‘Dad, what are taxes?’ ‘You’ll figure it out.’”Young Gallagher took his father’s indifference as a personal failing. In his career – he says, in that cogent way that comes with therapy – he sought out surrogates such as Nichols, Altman and his co-stars Jack Lemmon and Peter O’Toole. Lemmon gave Gallagher a set of golf clubs. O’Toole took him to a football game.On stage, following a script, Gallagher felt liberated, finally confident he “wasn’t doing anything wrong”. In fact, he was getting enough right to land the part of Danny Zuko in Grease on Broadway, from an open audition in 1978. Yet he was not immune from the fickleness of show business. He notes the irony of “the best creative experience I ever had” – 1984’s The Real Thing, alongside Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons – precipitating his quarter-life crisis of confidence. Despite all his promise, opportunities dried up. Now Gallagher blames his agent then it coalesced with his “self-loathing, lack of confidence” and childhood trauma. “I started to question every morsel of my being until I couldn’t really function.”Even in his depression, Gallagher recognised he was at a “transition point … I could keep banging my head against the wall and have a tragic outcome – or pay attention to what was going on inside.” He quit the play and started over, with therapy and acting classes. “It was like a key into a lock.”Focusing on the craft allowed Gallagher to distance himself from the outcome – for better and worse. What he identifies as his career low, the 1992 Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls, was a critical and commercial hit. But Gallagher felt boxed in by the director, prevented from giving his best that “rough treatment” led him to avoid musicals for 25 years.“When something works in show business, it’s a miracle,” says Gallagher – so he has little time for big egos making it harder. Seeing someone get fired on a film set “just for a power thing” made a lasting impression. “One of the most toxic things in the world is success. I’ve seen people think they have all the answers, like: ‘If I’ve succeeded at this, then there’s nothing I can’t succeed at!’ You want to say: ‘Dude – you’re a member of the effin’ lucky club.’”Besides, he says: “I think the whole idea of stardom is kind of baloney I never really bought into it. I wouldn’t have had the skills, the way of thinking … I’ve seen the people who have achieved it, and what they’ve done to get there.”There is more freedom to being a character actor, he says more scope to surprise. The benefit to playing bad guys is that the parts were often underwritten. “They just wanted him to be an asshole … so it gave me a little elbow room,” says Gallagher. In the 1995 romcom While You Were Sleeping, he resisted the writers’ attempt to zhoosh up his character by making him an “awful person”, instead of just poorly suited to Sandra Bullock. “Why burden the audience with someone to hate? There’s just more opportunity in playing the character truthfully.”For all the writers’ occasional “capriciousness”, Gallagher says The OC was successful because of “the organism of the ensemble” – and the timing. Post 911 the US had “run with the wrong ball”, closing borders and embracing xenophobia, “the most cowardly, un-American thing”. Sandy Cohen was a corrective: a principled public defender, a New York Jew married to a gentile Californian, “not afraid to welcome others into his home. I thought that was the perfect story to be telling.”Gallagher sees parallels with his latest project, Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist, which just concluded its first season on NBC (E4 in the UK). In the whimsical musical dramedy, Zoey hears others’ private thoughts as songs – highlighting, for Gallagher, the importance of a sympathetic ear “in an era when we’ve been intentionally ided”.The Trump presidency has special significance for born-and-bred New Yorkers, he says sombrely. “We knew his father was a white supremacist,” he says, but they didn’t take Donald seriously until his attacks on the Central Park Five, a group of black teenagers who were wrongly convicted of the 1989 rape of a woman. “We realised he was no longer funny there was a darkness, and a willingness to do harm.”Still, it was a “no-brainer” to look to Trump for Buddy Kane, Gallagher’s ludicrous character in American Beauty: “I thought, who has the hugest opinion of themselves in real estate?” Gallagher was made heavier and older, and approximated the “pouffey thing going on” with an old wig of Cary Grant’s. “So when I was in bed with Annette Bening, Cary Grant was on top of her.”Twenty years on, it is “heartbreaking”, says Gallagher, to see the country “bamboozled by this con man … It really feels like they left the back door of the Capitol open.” He mimes a bandit, egging others on. “Take anything you can and get the hell out before they catch on! You want the parks?”And amid coronavirus, the stakes have never been higher. Gallagher winces: “It’s a little painful, having been raised by a bacteriologist mother, to hear someone blatantly disregarding science.” His mother had helped to develop the Romansky formula during the second world war, revolutionising the administration of penicillin. She died in 2004 after a 20-year struggle with Alzheimer’s disease.The experience informed his role in Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist he plays Zoey’s father, who is paralysed by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a somewhat similar brain disease. “What gave me some relief was that PSP doesn’t always find the same expression in people,” says Gallagher. The series creator, Austin Winsberg, whose father died of PSP, was also a check. “I knew that if I was screwing it up, he’d go: ‘No!’ And if he was leaving because he had to cry, I thought: ‘I’m in the ballpark.’”Gallagher has been gratified by praise from people with experience of PSP, or of caring for a parent – but some criticised his casting, as an able-bodied actor. What is his view: that disabled parts should go to disabled actors? That there is a limit to the experience that can be portrayed by acting? Gallagher flips the question: “I would say, people with disabilities shouldn’t be automatically excluded from playing any role.” He notes that one episode features deaf actors and musical numbers in sign language. And “hard and fast rules about who should do what” do not recognise the hurdles a project has to clear in order to get made, he says, with mounting (and somewhat surprising) impatience.The answer, as he sees it, is more, and more erse stories – and by that measure progress is fast. He points to Grace and Frankie, in which he plays Jane Fonda’s love interest. “What an extraordinarily disruptive notion: people older than 25 have life experience that deserves investigation and sharing!” he says with good-natured sarcasm. “And, my God – there are people 25 and under that want to watch!”It is the chance to be part of those stories that have “a place in the world” that keeps Gallagher singing his scales in quarantine and, he believes, will see show business through the challenge of coronavirus. “Broadway was supposed to be over with 911 it turned out to be exactly what the world needed. And what are people doing in quarantine? They’re watching a lot of Netflix. Because these stories are important.”And even the bad guys have a part. Days after 911, Gallagher was asked to go to Ground Zero to boost the morale of emergency workers who had missed out on visits from the president and the Yankees. “The fires were still burning, the smell of death …” Gallagher’s last big picture had been American Beauty. “I’m thinking: ‘What have I done with my life? I’ve got to change jobs, do something that counts.” And all of a sudden, one of the firefighters …” Gallagher erupts in a New-Yoik holler. “‘LOOK WHO’S HERE! ‘FUCK ME, YOUR MAJESTY’, IT’S THE KING!’”Buddy Kane was an asshole. But they were still glad to see him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e312f7c296e44cebfcedb09a4d8cd76860324294/0_401_6124_3676/master/6124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54569353936ae37d7fbc7a158ccbdaf9","title":"kim joys recipe for sticky toffee pudding and a biscuit groundhog","story":"The current situation demands comfort food – and friendly biscuit groundhogsSticky toffee pudding is the comfort food we need right now and groundhogs reflect how I feel, since every day seems to be merging into one.

Place in a bowl and pour over the boiling water. Leave to soak for 30 minutes.Preheat the oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Generously butter the 200ml pudding moulds. Sieve some flour over the top and shake off the excess.Cream together the butter and sugar (it is fine if it’s a little grainy). Add the treacle and whisk again. Add the eggs slowly (a few tablespoons at a time), whisking well after each addition. Add the self-raising flour and bicarbonate of soda. Whisk until just combined (don’t over mix).At this point, pour the dates and water into a food processor and blend until mostly smooth. Or you can mash them with a fork.Add the blended dates to the cake batter, and then add the milk. Whisk until just combined. The mixture will look curdled – that is normal.Divide between the moulds, and bake for around 25 to 30 minutes, or until springy on top. (While they are baking is a good time to make the groundhog decoration). Leave to cool in the tins while you make the sauce.Add the butter, sugar, treacle and cream to a saucepan. Heat over medium heat and keep stirring until all the butter has melted and it is smooth.Run a knife around the edge of the pudding tins and turn out on to a plate. Pour over the toffee sauce. Add decoration if desired. Eat straight away. Or keep well covered and reheat later to serve.For the groundhog decorationUse a knife to carefully trim your chosen biscuit into shape. Make the water icing: mix the icing sugar with a very small amount of water – just a few drops at a time – until it comes together as a smooth, pipeable icing.Place a third into a piping bag. Then dye the remaining icing light brown. Put half of this into a second piping bag. Then add black food dye to the remaining icing, and transfer this to a third piping bag.Use the white icing to carefully attach flaked almonds to create the ears. Then pipe on the face (adding edible eyes, or piping these on). Use small pieces of flaked almonds to create the teeth. Pipe the black icing to outline the biscuit and ears.For the “soil”, crumble up a chocolate biscuit or a plain biscuit mixed with a little cocoa powder. Sprinkle the edible soil on top of the pudding, and then place the groundhog on top, pressing down so that it sticks into the pudding."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71517cf9e45c95bf9cf2d7ea2924ac34d29c5936/77_290_2749_1651/master/2749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1da1fa8f3c7f46e9153675c6706e41","title":"watford reveal one player and two staff tested positive for coronavirus premier league","story":"Troy Deeney was one of several Watford players who chose not to take part in small-group training on Wednesday, the day after three members of the club’s playing and coaching staff, including the centre-back Aidy Mariappa, were found to have tested positive for Covid-19.Four groups of players, each of no more than five, trained at the club’s Hertfordshire base. Excluding Mariappa, who is isolating for seven days and will be retested before returning to training, Gerard Deulofeu, who moved into his physiotherapist’s house in Spain before that country imposed its lockdown in an effort to accelerate his recovery from a serious knee injury, and those on loan when league football was paused, the club have 26 senior professionals, including three goalkeepers.Those who chose not to come in were given details of the exercises their teammates were being put through and asked to do them alone. They are under no pressure to come to the training ground before they are comfortable to do so.“I think it’s important that they feel that they’re able to make a decision like that,” Nigel Pearson told Sky Sports. “I think one of the key factors in this is that there are still a few unanswered questions. Wherever there is an element of doubt, and if players feel that there are too many question marks, then we respect their decision.”Watford have been one of the most outspoken clubs regarding plans to restart the Premier League in June. Deeney had said he would not participate in group training and over the weekend Pearson raised concerns about the possibility of a coronavirus-related death in the league.“I’ve made my position very clear, in terms of what I think about the overall situation, but having said that my job still is to support the people I work alongside, and that’s what I will do,” Pearson said on Wednesday. “Once the decision had been made to restart it was very important that we try to create an environment in which the players feel safe.”Watford, like other clubs, will decide whether to support the protocols designed to allow contact training once those are put forward. The government hopes to approve guidelines this week.Mariappa revealed he was the Watford player who tested positive for coronavirus but said he was asymptomatic and had not breached any guidelines. “It was a big surprise because I haven’t really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids,” he told the . “I’ve mainly just been homeschooling and keeping fit. My lifestyle is very quiet, certainly no parties or going out or anything, so I really don’t know how I got it. Like most people, we’ve been having more deliveries of food and things, so maybe that’s one way, and my partner has been to the supermarket a few times.”The stance taken by Deeney and other Watford players was backed by Jonas Baer-Hoffmann, head of the international players’ union, Fifpro. “There’s a lot of uncharted territory when it comes to these protocols. They all speak about risk management and no system can exclude the risk of infection. So it’s about the probability with which you minimise that risk. Players should have the right to air their concerns and should be central to the process of evolving the rules to put them into action.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7973a4c012749c125c8cd5a73adffe5fe6a45b5/0_0_3445_2067/master/3445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b961ec1ceb5fc7ffcc1fafb35f84c683","title":"children of darfur revisiting those orphaned by the conflict","story":"Photojournalist Paddy Dowling travelled to Sudan to find out what happened to those growing up in the midst of genocideThe Darfur genocide claimed the lives of an estimated 300,000 civilians, forced 1.6 million people to flee their homes inside the country and a further 600,000 refugees to spill across borders of neighbouring countries.By April 2003, Darfur’s reckoning had arrived. “Devils on horseback” – tribal militia, who dismounted, traded spears for Kalashnikovs and climbed aboard Land Cruisers. Now government-backed, highly mobile and without mercy or conscience, Janjaweed rebels had answered the president’s call-to-arms, bolstering support for the Sudanese army’s counter-insurgency to ethnically cleanse the uprising of Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribal minorities which were aligned with the Sudan Liberation MovementArmy (SLMA) and Justice Equality Movement groups.Following aerial bombardment by the Sudanese army, Janjaweed rebels spilled through the villages. They killed, raped, looted and burned – and they abducted boys as child soldiers.It is widely documented that children affected by the Darfur genocide were subjected to all of the UN’s “six grave violations against children during armed conflict”: killing or maiming of children recruitment or use of child soldiers rape and other forms of sexual violence against children abduction of children attacks against schools or hospitals and the denial of humanitarian access to children.During the genocide, people under siege in the remote villages of Kebkabiya, north Darfur, home to predominantly Fur and Zaghawa tribes, woke to the sound of gunfire and the screams of villagers. Khadija Abdullah, 35, witnessed her husband Ahmed leave their home never to return. He had gathered with the men of the village. All they had to defend themselves were primitive agricultural tools and they were killed where they stood. Families that were able escaped into night with just the clothes they wore.Displacement during the conflict often occurred either in anticipation of attacks or, for Khadija, after the event that left her grieving, terrified and fleeing with her three children to safety.Sudan’s former administration both instigated the humanitarian crisis in Darfur and prevented its resolution. Delivering aid in Sudan has not been without challenge. Strategies to delay, limit and deny access by aid agencies to civilians in need are well documented.Today the security situation in the Darfur region remains unstable. More than 8 million people are in need of assistance. Urgent humanitarian intervention and protection of the most marginalised is required to prevent paralysing the generations that follow.Sumbul Rizvi, the UN refugee agency’s principal adviser on internal displacement, who was stationed in a remote West Darfur field office from 2007 to 2009, says humanitarian intervention for the most vulnerable, including separated and orphaned children, was part of the UNHCR response. “We work with affected populations and their host communities to provide shelter, coordinate the work of partner agencies, and ensure that IDP camps and sites receive the attention they deserve.”“The protection of children cannot be in isolation of their communities, who may continue to be exposed to risks even in displacement,” she says. “Ensuring protection and solutions for IDPs in Darfur is vital for a peaceful future for Sudan.”International NGO Qatar Charity has worked with Sudan’s governments past and present to protect the fatherless or orphaned young people in Darfur through its “Rofaqaa” sponsorship programme since the conflict began. The scheme to date has ensured the provision of shelter, food, clean water, access to education and protection to more than 3,500 orphaned children in Darfur and 12,244 across Sudan.However Sudan’s social welfare ministry estimated that orphaned or fatherless children of conflict numbered 45,000 in 2015 in South Darfur alone.Mohamed Al Ghamdi, director of external affairs for Qatar Charity, says: “Our child protection strategy supports the continued UN-led international development plan for Darfur, by implementing a large number of projects for the reconstruction of the region in partnership with the UN Development Program and the Qatar Fund for Development … with the aim of promoting peace and development.” Rahman Ali, 16, was only months old when he was carried to safety in the arms of his mother, Khadija, from their besieged village in North Darfur where his father was killed. For 10 years he was a beneficiary of the Rofaqaa programme. He hopes to contribute to promoting the peace that he says his country so badly needs.However a key prerequisite for long-term peace and stability in Darfur is disarmament.The Darfur peace agreements of 2006 and 2011 both required the disarmament and demobilisation of Janjaweed militia along with SLMA and various rebel groups. While these were seen as steps in the right direction, to deliver successful demilitarisation there must be significant provision for alternative livelihood opportunities for ex-combatants. Should this not happen, the risk remains of re-recruitment to other factions, perpetuating a cycle of insecurity.Indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity and deposed, convicted and incarcerated in a coup in Khartoum last year, former president Omar al-Bashir’s tenure has been marked by murder and genocide and left a legacy of families traumatised and destitute.The pro-democracy revolution of 2019 brought change to Khartoum, and if Sudan’s transitional government can resist being drawn into foreign conflicts and instead provide a realistic prospect of return for the displaced, then perhaps establishing a new roadmap for peace in the region may be possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7e920b127366f18089a49c639f0bcb3b7300f1/0_297_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9bebd00fddcea5124ba790955e95d6","title":"uk hot weather and social distancing in pictures","story":"As lockdown restrictions in England were relaxed and temperatures climbed to 28.2C, people headed for beaches and parks, leading to concerns about social distancing.

The Victorians are well-remembered for their culture of sexual repression, and – as a direct result – their obsession with sex and erotica. So perhaps Thatcher should have seen it coming: mere months later, the country’s No 1 single was the most gloriously filthy in chart-topping history.Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax, the ultimate banger about banging, made little impact on its first release on ZTT Records in late 1983. But after a performance on Top of the Pops in January 1984, it shot to the top of the charts and stayed there for five weeks, beginning a year of total chart dominance for the Liverpool group. It remains the sixth bestselling single in British history, beaten only by Band Aid, Candle in the Wind, Bohemian Rhapsody and some novelty songs. Its immense success proves that, besides charity, nothing brings the UK together quite like extreme horniness.With not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard – and the band performing it even more so. Frontmen Holly Johnson and Paul Rutherford were both openly gay, still a rarity in pop at the time, and courted controversy with the use of fetish wear in their performances and videos. Famously, it was censorship from the BBC that propelled the song to its peak: when it was at No 6 in the charts, BBC Radio 1’s breakfast DJ Mike Read yanked it off air after taking a cursory glance at the lewd lyrics and cover art. He declared he’d never play it again. The BBC backed him by banning it across all its shows – including TOTP. For five weeks, Frankie were announced as No 1 – and then the show played out on a different track.The song’s runaway success was testament to the fact that censorship and repression don’t work. It was a powerful message at the dawn of the Thatcher era: this was towards the beginning of the HIVAids epidemic that would devastate the LGBT community and lead to a dangerous increase in homophobia, and just three years before Thatcher would introduce the regressive Section 28 amendment. It was an era of hate, in which homosexuality was pushed even further to the fringes of society than it had been before. And yet, Frankie Goes to Hollywood prevailed.In an interview with the  in 2014, journalist Paul Morley – one of ZTT’s masterminds – reflected that the group’s success was like a “weird hallucination … The fact that something so successful yet is part of a shadowy history is ultimate proof that it was special.” It’s true that their dominance of British pop culture was momentary: they had two further No 1 singles and a bestselling album in 1984 1986’s Liverpool flopped, and Johnson went solo to some success. But at a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain’s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e4627447f3152b3a1f64d2eea5563eb863cff9/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292598d450c3dedc4a233bd98e20b8e0","title":"how coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels","story":"Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales.

As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Lisa O\u0027CarrollMargaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory.\u0026nbspTony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers\u0027 rights.Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.”Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro.EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club.Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”.\u0026nbspDavid Cameron returns with reform package.According to the statement, there will be no customs fees payable on goods remaining in the region.Neither will there be security certificates for goods going in either direction. These are the so-called exit and entry declaration forms that the former Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay revealed would be needed for goods traded in both directions. Gove’s pledge not to apply tariffs on goods transported to Northern Ireland from Great Britain complies with the spirit of the deal struck between Johnson and the EU. But it could set him on a collision course with Brussels, which had envisaged that customs controls would apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, with rebates on tariffs for goods that did not go on to the Republic of Ireland.Sources say the government has come under pressure from big supermarket chains among other businesses who have argued that if they are delivering consignments to shoppers in Northern Ireland, a tariff-charge and charge-back arrangement would lead to costly and unnecessary paperwork.Gove promised the checks would involve “the minimum possible bureaucratic consequences for business and traders, particularly those carrying out their affairs entirely within the UK customs territory”.The government has said, however, that “some new administrative process” will apply for traders because the deal requires the UK to apply EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. #The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, welcomed the plan, revealing discussions on agrifood had been “difficult and sensitive”. But she warned the UK deal must ensure it “does not saddle inidual Northern Ireland businesses with further costly administrative burdens”.Claire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Belfast South, said Gove had “finally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape” for businesses and warned that “castles in the air” such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea.Sinn Féin said the checks showed the “forked tongue” approach of the UK government.Discussing the papers in the Commons, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: “We welcome the statement today but it does expose the broken promises made by the prime minister ... Even now, many fear that the government are not willing to admit the full extent of those. We have seven months to get this right and we must.”Business leaders also gave the plan a cautious welcome. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a “positive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls”, but that the language was so “loose” in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU’s court.Aodhán Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. “The UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point, but there are still many questions that are left unanswered.”An EU spokesman said the commission welcomed the proposal and would study it in detail.“We have said we can provide certain flexibilities in terms of customs checks, but they have to fit with the union’s customs code, because the Irish border is the EU border, so the union customs code applies,” a second EU official said.

But, unexpectedly, The Last Dance has made me gravitate towards LeBronI am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan. You see, I was born in Chicago a few years before he arrived in town and I came of age as he himself blossomed from a college hero into a global icon. Somewhere deep inside an armoire drawer, I have a t-shirt that reads: “Sorry Sir Charlie, You Can’t Be Like Mike” – a disintegrating curbside souvenir from Game 3 of the 1993 NBA finals, one of a dozen-odd Bulls games I was lucky enough to attend during the team’s storybook run. When ESPN announced plans for The Last Dance documentary, I felt vindicated. Here, at last, was the Air-tight argument that would put basketball’s all important greatest of all time debate to rest. LeBron James stans would have no choice but to bow down to the man who unironically calls himself “Black Jesus”.Rightfully, I should be basking in Jordan’s mandate. But truth be told I have never been more conflicted.When I was a kid, it was enough to take Jordan at face value. As far as I knew, he was an otherworldly basketball player whose vast skill owed as much to natural talent as sweat equity, and whose clutch gene traced to a never-say-die attitude. Sure, there were reports of him sparring with management and tangling with teammates. And sure, there was more recent evidence of him snubbing selfie-seeking rappers, stiffing kids out of free Air Jordans and doubling down on grudges in maybe the most bitter hall of fame speech ever delivered. But it was difficult to argue with the results.Forget growing the NBA globally. Jordan was an excuse to put off homework for a few hours, a reason to get together with friends – a blissful ersion for me as my parents went through a lengthy orce. He was an uncomplicated superstar for a relatively quiet time in history when wars were over in a month and the greatest question facing humanity was whether Ross and Rachel would end up together. It was clear to everyone that we were living in a moment.But now that the moment has passed, who could appraise Jordan on his basketball skill alone anymore? As much as The Last Dance tried to keep a tight focus on the court, with Jordan the executive producer hand-checking the viewer all the while, I couldn’t help but note the many belittling references to his “supporting cast” or the villainizing of Bulls GM Jerry Krause – who, it should be noted, is dead and unable to defend himself. I watched Jordan dismiss his 80s-era teammates as womanizing cokeheads and take pride in bullying benchwarmer Scott Burrell and Steve Kerr. I watched him explain away his famous “Republicans buy sneakers too” line as a joke.More to the point: I watched Jordan speak adoringly about his parents and brother and the off-duty Chicago cops in his entourage without really making much mention of his three adult children. In fact, I was convinced that was where the documentary was headed after Jordan’s passionate soliloquy on the price of winning. But the kids only appear briefly toward the end of the series. Certainly, when it came to shutting out the distractions of the world, nobody did it better than MJ. But we don’t live in that world anymore. Hence why, an adult now, I find myself gravitating more and more toward James.At worst James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him. And then he went well beyond even that. He forced his high school friends on his early money minders, and today they are part of his billion-dollar enterprise. He married his high school sweetheart and can reliably be seen embarrassing his three kids on the family’s Taco Tuesday night he waffles openly between kicking himself for passing his name to his first born-son and flogging himself to hang around the league long enough to play with him. He denounces the unjust killings of unarmed black men, tangles with the commander-in-chief – he built a school in his hometown before jetting off to Los Angeles, for goodness sakes. At the very least he should have drawn even with Jordan in the ESPN poll’s “positive off-court impact” category.As for on the court, well, James sees himself more clearly as MJ’s teammate than his rival. “Me personally, the way I play the game – team first – I feel like my best assets work perfectly with Mike,” James said in a video released Monday on Uninterrupted’s YouTube channel. “It would’ve been a whole ‘nother level with me being that point forward alongside of him during those Chicago runs.”Doubtless many old school basketball fans will read that statement as an indictment of the present generation of NBA stars who would sooner consolidate primacy in free agency than battle one another for it on court. And 10-year-old me probably would have scoffed at it, too. But now that I’m four times as old and a father myself? How could I not think the guy who builds bridges would make a better role model for my son than the guy who would torch anything that lies in his path?That is not to say one player is better than the other. On that score it’s a shame that basketball isn’t more like football, where intergenerational talents are seen for what they truly are: descendants of the same line. Just as there’s no Tom Brady without Joe Montana, there’s no LeBron without Jordan. There’s no Kobe Bryant, a GOAT challenger whose copycatting of Jordan I once found as grating as nails on a chalkboard. But when Bryant explained, in footage shot for The Last Dance before his death this year, that his career was essentially a love letter to Jordan, all I could take away was regret. Clearly, eternal greatness doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. It could just be a pleasant distraction, a standard to aspire. It could just be a body of work to appreciate in its time that encapsulated a moment that won’t soon be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b905bf401a6c610c6c1da96b42d556d433221cb/0_0_4252_2551/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=167a742fdf2850e55256cd1036ff5b7a","title":"cricket obsession ball shines saliva icc covid 19","story":"Covid-19 has caused the ICC to step in but players have tried various means to manipulate the ball and help their bowlersFor the casual observer the discussion about cricket-ball maintenance must seem bizarre given all the other issues surrounding the sport: cricket is faced by potential bankruptcy, the necessity of biosecure stadiums and a debate over whether it is appropriate to play in them. Yet in such uncertain times we seem to be just as concerned about the relative merits and dangers of applying saliva and sweat to a cricket ball.In other sports no one spends much time contemplating the ball. Tennis players can be seen asking for three of them and then discarding one before serving, but the impression is that this has more to do with superstition than anything else. Footballers are not too bothered about which balls they kick. Admittedly England’s rugby players in the 2011 World Cup faced allegations of “ball-tampering”. Two members of the management team – Jonny Wilkinson’s kicking mentor, Dave Alred, and the fitness specialist, Paul Stridgeon – were suspended after England’s 67-3 victory against Romania when they had been found to have illegally switched balls so that Wilkinson could attempt conversions with his favourite. But this was a freakish occurrence.In cricket there have been arguments about balls for decades. On the 1976-77 tour of India, John Lever was accused of cheating by the India captain, Bishen Bedi, who believed Lever was applying Vaseline to the ball to enhance the shine and keep it swinging. The Kiwis in 1990 admitted to using bottle tops to change the condition of the ball in Faisalabad Imran Khan once admitted he had used the same implement. Mike Atherton nearly lost his job as England captain after the “dirt in the pocket” affair in 1994 in 2018 Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft did lose their jobs after the sandpaper incident in South Africa – although on both occasions it was the cover-up that really undermined them.Along the way arguments over the condition of the ball caused Pakistan to refuse to take to the field in a Test at the Oval in 2006 and the game was abandoned, while Marcus Trescothick has happily acknowledged the assistance of Murray Mints to make the ball swing during the epic Ashes series of 2005. They aren’t all mad there is some logic here. Captains and bowlers are desperate to make that ball move in the air or off the pitch. Otherwise they are liable to spend an awfully long time in the field.Initially that movement was more likely to be achieved by picking the seam. This entailed using the thumbnail to raise the seam, which became so proud that it was far more likely to grip upon hitting the surface before, hopefully, changing direction. There were a few poachers who would become gamekeepers in that era. Ken Palmer, who played in the 1960s and umpired in the 1980s and 1990s, was renowned as a superb, one-handed seam picker. So too was Stuart Turner of Essex, known as “The Whistler” since you could hear the ball with its high seam fizzing towards you when he was bowling. In those days the umpires rarely examined the ball. Bowling just before lunch at Taunton I might spend my time urgently flattening the seam – since the umpires might just have a look at the ball during the interval.Reverse swing began in the 80s though most of us did not realise it at the time. There was merely bewilderment that Sarfraz Nawaz of Pakistan and Northamptonshire could suddenly make a ball that was 60 overs old start to swing in to the right-handers. I remember being another confused victim, caught at bat-pad in a Test match. Sarfraz helped to educate Imran and the next generation, which included the great Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The Aussies became aware of this phenomenon too but, like the English, they couldn’t quite explain it. Wasim and Waqar soon became the masters of reverse swing and they would educate their county colleagues at Lancashire and Surrey. The ball had to be handled delicately as if it was a precious diamond. One side would be polished, the other had to be bone dry and to acquire an almost dimpled effect. At one county captains’ meeting at Lord’s some “offending” balls were passed around. Mike Watkinson, the Lancashire captain, recognised one of the balls, blushed and quickly passed the box along. When Ian Greig, captain of Surrey and a more brazen character, had a look he immediately bellowed: “Oh yes, that’s one of ours.”Waqar and Wasim were magnificent sights in the early 1990s (I had retired by then) inflicting broken bails and toes in equal measure. Even the best were tormented. The image remains of Graeme Hick coming out to bat in the 1992 series: Waqar knew what he was going to bowl, Hick knew what Waqar was going to bowl yet there was nothing the batsman could do about the perfect inswinging yorker. In time England caught up. In 2005 it was the ability of Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to make the ball reverse swing that began to spook Australia. Sometimes that movement is barely perceptible from a distance but if the batsmen and bowlers think “it’s reversing” the balance of the game has changed.This is why there remains this seemingly preposterous debate about ball maintenance as the prospect of some Test cricket this summer grows. We have heard pronouncements from the ICC about the relative risks of applying saliva and sweat. The entrepreneurs of the Kookaburra ball makers in Australia are experimenting with wax applicators to aid the bowlers. And perhaps we will soon witness the resurgence of long hair and the use of Brylcreem, which was famously promoted by Denis Compton and Pakistan’s Fazal Mahmood in the 1950s. Anything to get the damn thing to move sideways."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d600918b252dade68e46bc6c043a5ce99a47cf65/0_119_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e842015c3a353fcd22425f34d9825a5","title":"liverpool v newcastle united premier league 1996 as it happened","story":"Liverpool will wear red with an ostentatious white v-neck.

Hughie Gallacher would have looked damn fine in this shirt. Anyway, there’s plenty of time for a pre-match pint. Shall we nip to the bar? Mine’s a Carlsberg, or failing that a bottle of Newcastle Brown.Kevin Keegan has been criticised for upsetting the balance of his team with the introduction of Faustino Asprilla, their £7.5m super-signing from Parma. David Batty has come under some light fire too, having displaced Lee Clark in the midfield since his arrival from Blackburn Rovers. Both players keep their place, and Keegan must hope that Asprilla soon forges an understanding with Les Ferdinand, desperately trying to rediscover his goalscoring form of earlier in the season. The only change from the dismal 2-0 defeat at Arsenal: Warren Barton makes way for Steve Watson.Liverpool meanwhile are in if-it-ain’t broke mode. Roy Evans names the same 11, plus bench, selected last Sunday for the FA Cup breeze past Aston Villa.Newcastle United must be starting to question whether the 1995-96 Premier League title is their destiny after all. It sure seemed that way when Kevin Keegan’s entertainers sat 12 points clear of Manchester United just eight weeks ago. But now, after picking up just four points from the last 15 on offer, their advantage has been frittered away, and now they’re three points behind Alex Ferguson’s men. They’ve still got two games in hand, but the margin of error is slight now. They have to convert the contents of their back pocket into points on the board.They could very much do with a result here tonight at Anfield. That’s far from a pipe dream: they beat Liverpool 2-1 at St James’ Park back in November, then won at Anfield in the League Cup a few weeks later, Steve Watson the unlikely goalscoring hero on both occasions. They look to have Liverpool’s number, and will be hoping to make it three out of three tonight, hauling themselves level with the leaders. That’d put them second on goal difference with a game still in hand, their dream still very much alive.But defeat tonight would be unthinkable. Liverpool responded marvellously to that League Cup defeat, going on a 20-game unbeaten run that ended only two weekends ago at Nottingham Forest. They immediately got back on the horse with a 3-0 evisceration of Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-finals last weekend, and are high on life right now. They’re also still on the fringes of the title race, eight points behind Manchester United in third. A win tonight would keep their faint hopes alive. But they do need all three points, or it’s pretty much all over for them.Newcastle by contrast simply need to avoid defeat. A win would be lovely, naturally, but a point at Anfield isn’t to be sniffed at, and would at least ensure they’d still be in control of their own destiny. With the Toon desperate to end their 69-year wait for the league title, and Liverpool drinking in the last-chance saloon, this is effectively a winner-takes-all gunfight. It’s Wednesday evening! It’s live on Sky! It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94450ccc2024ebe45163078c1d5fdf275a21a824/0_173_3652_2191/master/3652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=966d217fc3c82a9d9e1bcce9018d9bd5","title":"edinburgh royal lyceum hibernation cancel 2020 programme","story":"£700,000 loss forces landmark theatre to cancel entire 2020 programme in hope of emerging renewed next spring – and staving off financial fate of other venuesThe Royal Lyceum theatre in Edinburgh has postponed all remaining performances and events for 2020 and told staff their positions are at risk of redundancy due to the impact of Covid-19, which has cost it more £700,000 in lost income.The Lyceum announced it is to enter a “period of hibernation” as a building-based producing theatre, with artistic director David Greig saying he had to reduce the theatre’s wage costs in order to avoid its permanent closure.Greig said: “Entering this period of hibernation will allow us to conserve the limited resource we have through the dark winter of Covid-19 and emerge, hopefully in the spring, with enough capacity to make theatre again with the brilliant theatre-makers of Scotland for the people of Edinburgh.”The artistic director added that he had been left with the “stark choice” of either a redundancy process now to reduce our expenditure, or “total closure before Christmas – an alternative that would leave the Lyceum shut long after the pandemic has passed”.The theatre is the latest cultural institution to have financial difficulties as a result of Covid-19. Both the Nuffield Southampton and Southport theatres announced they were going into administration because of the impact Covid-19 had on revenues, while the Royal and Derngate in Northampton, Shakespeare’s Globe and the National Theatre in London have all sounded warnings about their futures.Last week, the Old Vic’s artistic director, Matthew Warchus, told the  that his theatre was in a “seriously perilous” financial situation because of the Covid-19 crisis. Warchus said that the UK’s furlough scheme, which has been extended until October, was stopping the theatre from “falling to pieces” – but, because many theatres don’t expect to open until 2021 at the earliest, more help would be needed.“We are all puzzling away, thinking hard about how we can respond to this situation and what our creative input can be,” he said. “There are some bright people on those calls. We are mostly stumped because our hands are tied behind our backs: if you can’t bring performers and creatives together, with an audience, you’re incredibly limited.”The Lyceum announcement came on the same day Bectu, the union representing media and entertainment industries, released results of a survey which found theatre workers are concerned about being “forgotten” once lockdown measures are eased.Head of Bectu Philippa Childs said: “The extension of the furlough schemes is very welcome, but many people are still facing a massive cliff edge with huge uncertainty ahead of them. As long as social-distancing restrictions continue to be necessary, Bectu is acutely aware that the challenges for theatres to open again grow each day.“The industry is facing a potentially catastrophic impact from Covid-19, and government, employers and workers must come together to develop a strategy for our cultural sectors’ survival.”The Lyceum is consulting with unions and staff about possible redundancies, and will offer full refunds for customers who booked tickets for shows that have been cancelled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d20c2c0544660c337abe163d6bf33f1980efd36/0_36_5536_3324/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70cf956de09dd9304b912fe6a5a1cb62","title":"your best holiday food or drink memory","story":"Whether it was cheap-as-chips or budget-busting, tell us ab out the most mind-blowing food-and-drink experience you’ve had on your travelsPerfect pizza in a Naples backstreet or spicy-sharp noodles from a Hanoi stall?

To commemorate what could be one of the greatest comebacks in television history, here’s a look at the best ever BBC Three shows.A three-part Russell T Davies comedy drama based on the memoirs of Giacomo Casanova, this was originally supposed to be a vehicle for Peter O’Toole. However, even O’Toole was blasted off the screen by the sheer electric crackle of David Tennant. This show is basically the reason Tennant became Doctor Who.A show from much simpler times, when people were content to watch docusoaps about relatively obnoxious bosses twonking about for the cameras while their beleaguered employees pull faces behind his back. This one was about a man named Nev who liked to sack people if they didn’t participate in his pre-shift company-wide singalong. Monstrous.A BBC Three mainstay, simply for its horrible premise. Each week a bride-to-be detailed the wedding of her dreams, then handed financial control of the ceremony over to her groom, who inevitably ruined everything so much that the bride burst into tears.A mockumentary about a pirate radio station operating out of Brentford, west London. What was most remarkable about People Just Do Nothing is how it took a niche sub-genre and turned it into a solidly classical sitcom. For a while, this was the new Only Fools and Horses.It’s hard to believe that The Mighty Boosh ran for such a comparatively short time, because its legacy is so strong. In the course of three years, the show introduced a brand of violently aggressive whimsy that almost singlehandedly created an entire comedy movement.More proof that BBC Three worked best as a comedy incubator. This was the channel that offered a chance to a nothingy little relationship sitcom by James Corden and Ruth Jones. It did well, then was promoted to BBC One. When it returned for a Christmas special in 2019, it was the most-watched scripted show of the entire year.Possibly the worst-titled show in the history of the channel – because, really, it had almost no bearing whatsoever on the content itself – Snog Marry Avoid was basically a programme in which people with distinct looks were “made under” to look like functioning members of society. It had a weird undertone of “conform or die”, but in a way that just made it more interesting.A politically angry prank show. Heydon Prowse and Jolyon Rubenstein attempted to expose societal hypocrisy by dressing up and infiltrating protests, or asking members of the public what they thought about issues. Perhaps a little heavy-handed in places but, when it worked, it was stunning.It’s hard to remember that Little Britain began on BBC Three, or how deliberately edgy it initially was. Before all the merchandise, playground catchphrases and kids’ books, Little Britain was a riot of nudity and blackface and suicide jokes. It would all do very badly now, but at the time it was a sensation.Exactly the sort of thing that BBC Three should have been producing from the online wilderness, Pls Like was a razor-sharp satire of influencer culture. Depressed, charisma-free host Liam Williams investigated various YouTube fads, only to discover that they were ultimately as empty as he was. Fantastic.Before embarking on his career as a director of elliptical arthouse films, Ben Wheatley made this sketch show. Just six episodes long, with a vaguely linked narrative, The Wrong Door was both incredibly funny, visually beautiful and spectacularly well cast. This is such an overlooked gem of a thing.Harry Thompson and Shaun Pye’s satirical animation was dark. Like, brutally dark. Suicide, bestiality, sexual degradation and terrorism were some of its regular targets. A girl returning her birthday presents so her dad could maintain his gambling addiction. A father killing himself because he could no longer identify with his children. Like I said, bleak. But funny, too. I promise. It did Four Lions before Chris Morris got there, too.There is a very good chance that we’ll look back and see This Country as the pinnacle of the mockumentary. A near-perfect look at rural village life, it’s both incredibly depressing and very silly. Kerry and Kurtan have no real means of escape from their surroundings, but they fill their time by focusing hard on nothing at all. The best episode is about an argument over who gets to use a certain shelf on an oven. It’s majestic.Although naturally more suited to comedy, BBC Three was also unafraid to find new dramatic voices. Perhaps its biggest success was Bodies, an unflinching drama about medical malpractice written by a former doctor named Jed Mercurio. This remains his best work, and I’m not only including it here for fear that he’ll have another Twitter tantrum if I don’t.Russell Tovey and Sarah Solemani in a sitcom – any sitcom – together would have been a recipe for success. But this wasn’t any sitcom, it was Stefan Golaszewski’s gorgeously observed and intermittently filthy delve into the nitty gritty of twentysomething relationships. Golaszewski most recently wrote Mum, and you can see the seeds of that show being sown here.If BBC Three does return to television, a lot of that will be down to the unstoppable international success of Fleabag. Everyone has already heard every possible opinion about the series, but it’s important to remember that its success was by no means guaranteed. Phoebe Waller-Bridge had already written one show (Channel 4’s Crashing) and it was basically mishandled to death. But Fleabag ended up with a channel that treated it with the care it deserved, and the rest is history.The last show developed by Monkey Dust’s Thompson before his death in 2005, Sharon Horgan’s Pulling was a sitcom about three single female friends and their generally disastrous attitudes towards life. Pulling was funny and filthy and unflinching, and BBC Three’s decision to cancel it just as it was hitting its stride is perhaps its greatest ever mistake.Unlike almost anything else Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer have done (with the possible exception of Channel 4’s The Weekenders), Catterick was a six-episode sitcom written by the pair. It’s ostensibly about a man who returns to his home town to reunite with his brother in search of his long-lost son, but it really just lays a canvas for Vic and Bob’s trademark silliness. To date, it remains their greatest work.It isn’t until you see a list like this that you realise exactly how dark comedy was in the middle of the 00s. And yet the darkest of all might have been Julia Davis’s Nighty Night, a sitcom about an opportunistic woman who uses her husband’s terminal illness as a chance to ascend the social ladder. It begins with her learning her husband’s diagnosis and uttering the line: “I mean, why me?”, then tears off into storylines that revolve around disability, torture, murder and paedophilia. But it was funny too, I promise.A few weeks ago I wrote a list of overlooked comedy shows that were currently available to stream. Top of my wishlist was Sean Lock’s 15 Storeys High, but I had to omit it on the basis that it wasn’t streamable anywhere. This is an outrage. Not only was 15 Storeys High – a sitcom about a grumpy misanthrope in a tower block – the best ever BBC Three show, but it should have set Lock on a more celebrated path than the panel show circuit he has found himself on. It’s simultaneously very quiet and uproariously funny. People sorely deserve to have 15 Storeys High in their lives again.Honourable mentions: I Believe in UFOs: Danny Dyer Becoming Human Sun, Sea and Suspicious Parents"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/142458d403478d27416d1344df007682798be066/0_481_1328_796/master/1328.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=110bc2ace85a2577b3f794fd669222a1","title":"zacarias moussaoui september 11 al qaida bin laden","story":"The only man ever convicted in a US court for a role in the 911 attacks has said he is renouncing terrorism, al-Qaida and the Islamic State.Zacarias Moussaoui is serving a life sentence at a federal prison in Colorado after narrowly escaping the death penalty at his 2006 trial.Prosecutors argued that he could have prevented the attacks if he had not lied to the FBI about his knowledge of al-Qaida and its efforts to attack the US when he was arrested in August 2001.In a handwritten court motion Moussaoui filed with the federal court in Alexandria last month, Moussaoui wrote: “I denounce, repudiate Osama bin Laden as a useful idiot of the CIASaudi. I also proclaim unequivocally my opposition to any terrorist action, attack, propaganda against the US.”He also said he wanted “to warn young Muslim against the deception and the manipulation of these fake jihadis”.His remarks are a far cry from his 2006 trial, when he taunted victims and flashed a victory sign after a jury opted to send him to prison for life rather than execute him.At his final sentencing hearing, he said “God save Osama bin Laden.” Bin Laden was killed in a raid by US forces on a compound in Pakistan in 2011.Moussaoui made his renunciation in a petition seeking relaxation of the conditions under which he serves his sentence. In particular, he says he wants either Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani or Alan Dershowitz to represent him as a lawyer, so he can testify in a civil trial filed by victims of the 911 attacks.He has written numerous letters seeking to testify at the 911 civil trial, and at the military trials of al-Qaida members including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.But as recently as 2018, he continued to refer to himself as a “natural born terrorist“ in court papers. In another handwritten motion that year, he concluded his motion with “God Curse Ugly Satan of Abomination” in huge letters.Katherine Donahue, who wrote a book about Moussaoui after attending his 2006 trial, said she was unaware of any other instance in which he had renounced terrorism or Bin Laden. Terry Strada, whose husband died in the attack on the World Trade Center and is one of the plaintiffs suing Saudi Arabia for its alleged complicity in the attacks, was more skeptical.“I don’t trust him, that he’s reformed himself in prison,” she said. “I wouldn’t trust him around anybody’s youth.”US district Judge Leonie Brinkema, who presided over Moussaoui’s trial and was regularly subjected to Moussaoui’s insults in court papers, denied his request and said any grievance he has about the treatment he is receiving in prison should be filed in Colorado, where he resides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Officials have temporarily banned the sale of petrol in bulk, as well as firecrackers. Balloons for sporting events or other types of aerial advertising are also barred. Even more so than other years, it is critical that the parliamentary session – which coincides with the meeting of an advisory body, collectively known as “two sessions” – goes off without a hitch. The event, a time for China’s political elite to rubber-stamp policies and indicate new policy directions, was delayed for two months because of the coronavirus.In holding the two sessions, which begin on Thursday and Friday, Beijing is not only signalling its victory over the virus but is trying to emphasise control and leadership as it tries to move on from the pandemic. China is in unchartered territory of economic struggle and discontent at home and increased hostility from abroad, which makes the event especially important for its leader, Xi Jinping, who over the years has centralised power and embodies the government’s response to crises.Wu Qiang, a political scientist formerly, of Beijing’s Tsinghua University, said: “The two sessions is a very important stage for political performance. Even amid an epidemic, it must go on with everyone pretending that everything is normal. Xi, of course, hopes to consolidate his position through the two sessions by earning praise for his work countering the epidemic and showing a situation of stability.”US-China ties, already strained, have reached a new low, while other countries have joined calls for an independent investigation into the outbreak. Beijing also finds its diplomatic relations strained by growing support for its rival, Taiwan. In Hong Kong, anti-Beijing protests have resumed after a pause because of the coronavirus outbreak. Jessica Chen Weiss, associate professor of government at Cornell University, said: “The Chinese leadership faces a difficult challenge: to reset expectations and establish a new normal amid unprecedented domestic and international challenges.” At home, Xi faces the threat of public anger, which reached new heights at the worst of outbreak in Wuhan but has since largely disappeared from view. Observers say the party propaganda machine has gone into overdrive, praising the country’s win over the virus and emphasising the severity of the pandemic in other countries.China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said in February: “Only in China and only under the leadership of President Xi could there be such effective measures to put this sudden and fast-spreading epidemic under control.”The authorities appear to be clamping down further on criticism. Beijing police last month detained three people involved in saving censored content related to Covid-19 on the software development platform Github. A fourth citizen journalist, Zhang Zhan, who reported from Wuhan, has reportedly been detained in Shanghai. And Zhang Xuezhong, a constitutional scholar, was held after posting an open letter calling on the country’s parliament to push for political reforms.“One can imagine that the regime, facing a crisis, will adopt more methods of suppression,” said Wang Aizhong, an activist based in Guangzhou. Like many activists in China during sensitive political events, he has been visited by state security, which instructed him to stay quiet and ordered him not to travel to Beijing.Others say the two sessions, which state media have said will focus on issues such as climate change, GDP targets, poverty reduction and other reforms, barely disguise deeper problems of income inequality and lack of freedom of information and free speech, which critics say allowed the virus to spread.Wu said: “The basis of the Chinese model is that citizens sacrifice many kinds of rights and freedom for safety and wealth. In the past few months, Chinese people have started to doubt this. I have rarely seen such widespread suspicion of the government. For the first time in 20 years, freedom of speech has been linked to safety and security.”He added: “The two sessions will continue to praise the central government’s control over the virus, but it will only show the huge contractions of of Chinese society, where the widespread discontentment of regular people has no outlet.”Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9e2031501a7e6fa0c4f252fdc361fa2cca8158/0_226_3648_2188/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553162fbe9646662fa7e3e10fb4f2f28","title":"climate change turning parts antarctica green say scientists algae","story":"Researchers map ‘beginning of new ecosystem’ as algae bloom across surface of melting snowScientists have created the first large-scale map of microscopic algae on the Antarctic peninsula as they bloom across the surface of the melting snow, tinting the surface green and potentially creating a source of nutrition for other species.The British team behind the research believe these blooms will expand their range in the future because global heating is creating more of the slushy conditions they need to thrive.In some areas, the single-cell life-forms are so dense they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Communications.Biologists from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey spent six years detecting and measuring the green snow algae using a combination of satellite data and ground observation.The result is the first large-scale algae map of the peninsular, which will be used as a baseline to assess the speed at which the white continent is turning green due to the climate crisis and potentially offering sustenance to other species.They have already found the algae have formed close bonds with tiny fungal spores and bacteria. “It’s a community. This could potentially form new habitats. In some place, it would be the beginning of a new ecosystem,” said Matt Davey of Cambridge University, one of the scientists who led the study.He described the algae map as a missing piece of the carbon cycle jigsaw in the Antarctic.It identifies 1,679 separate blooms of green snow algae, which together covered an area of 1.9 sq km, equating to a carbon sink of about 479 tonnes a year. This is equivalent to the emissions of about 875,000 car journeys in the UK, though in global terms it is too small to make much of a difference to the planet’s carbon budget.Almost two-thirds of the green algal blooms were found on small, low-lying islands around the peninsula, which has experienced some of the most intense heating in the world, with new temperature records being set this summer. The snow algae were less conspicuous in colder, southern regions.Scientists have previously observed a change in green lichen and moss, but these grow extremely slowly compared with algae. In future, they will also measure red and orange algae and calculate how the presence of such colourful forms might be affecting the heat-reflecting albedo quality of the snow.“I think we will get more large blooms in the future. Before we know whether this has a significant impact on carbon budgets or bio albedo, we need to run the numbers,” said Andrew Gray, the lead author of the paper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=377b7e9952a8b143333fc91bc5ca5998","title":"ice cream vans return to uk streets as coronavirus lockdown eases","story":"Vendors return to streets after months of restrictions, new requirements and even death threatsAs the country basks in the hottest temperatures since the coronavirus outbreak began, the jingle that signals a Mr Whippy is at hand can be heard once again: the ice-cream van is making a comeback.They have faced council restrictions, tricky hygiene requirements, and even death threats. But with a captive audience and councils beginning to relax their rules, the country’s purveyors of Twisters and 99 Flakes are beginning to feel more optimistic about the future, some of them told the .“It seems to be picking up day by day now, and obviously with a bit of summer weather and a lot of people are still furloughed so they’re at home, we’re pretty busy for the next few days at least,” said Tony Roach, who delivers ice-cream around Eastbourne.Although under government guidance, ice-cream vans are subject to the same rules as takeaway restaurants and outdoor market stalls, restrictions have varied across regions and local authorities.Some councils have withdrawn licences for ice-cream vans during the lockdown, such as Blackburn, which revoked all permits but is in the process of reviewing its decision. “We need to think about safety over our enjoyment,” said councillor Jim Smith when making the original announcement.But in many areas of the country, vans have been allowed to continue operating as long as social distancing rules were maintained – although they weren’t welcomed by everyone.Zelica Carr, the CEO of the Ice Cream Alliance (ICA), said: “Some of our members were receiving death threats, because the council said they could go out and trade, and operate with social distancing, but some of the general public were, quite understandably, stressing about the fact everyone should be at home.”But she said many ice-cream traders had taken steps to ensure customers’ safety, and the ICA had sent out guidance to members – reminding them that 2 metres is roughly the length of a van, asking them to use contactless payments where possible, wear protective equipment such as gloves and use cone-holders to hand over ice-creams.It has been a tough few months for many ice-cream traders under lockdown, missing out on what would have been booming business during the sunniest April on record.Emma Wealthall owns a small ice-cream van business in Ripley, Derbyshire, alongside her daughter Jennifer Holmes. “We shut the business down totally in April because obviously you’ve got make sure you’re healthy first,” she said. “We were seeing all this nice weather, but my moral compass told me I needed to make sure I hadn’t got it.”Like many ice-cream traders, she was forced to adapt her business to the times, and started running inidual home deliveries of larger, six-scoop ice-cream tubs, asking people to place orders over the phone.“I put something out on Facebook and I was quite overwhelmed with the response,” she said. Delivery slots were quickly booked up, and they had to stop taking orders due to the huge quantity of orders.The trays are a growing trend in the ice-cream world, pioneered by the likes of Tee Smith – known as Mr Tee – who’s elaborate creations have helped him garner 300,000 followers on social media.“It’s just proved so popular, and it’s really taken off well for everyone,” said Smith, an ice-cream seller in Wrexham, north Wales. “It seems passion for ice-cream during the lockdown has increased somewhat, as our service has been very, very busy.”“It was getting to a desperate stage where the weather is so nice people and want ice-cream, but you can’t just go and sell it as normal. You’ve got to do something outside the box,” said Roach, who has also switched his business to home delivery during lockdown.The services have proved so successful that some councils have even asked ice-cream vendors to take on extra items like bread and milk for those who are self-isolating. “Some of our members have been working in the community through their street work for many years and they know where those vulnerable people are,” said Carr.Now restrictions have been eased, Wealthall has been doing the rounds on the streets again, and is happy to be getting back to normality, although with extra hygiene measures still in place. “Washing and sanitising after absolutely every customer, after two days my hands were red raw, so I’m using gloves as well now,” she said. “And I sanitise my money every night.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c51d7aff87f173723392e979dfd28b73df5aae01/0_39_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49d2fb47ba4b6536358b77751716f4d2","title":"top eu doctor europe should brace itself for second wave of coronavirus","story":"Exclusive: ‘The question is how big,’ says Dr Andrea Ammon, who thinks March skiing breaks were pivotal to spreadThe prospect of a second wave of coronavirus infection across Europe is no longer a distant theory, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments – including the UK – on disease control.“The question is when and how big, that is the question in my view,” said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).It has been the unenviable task of scientists to tell it as it is through the coronavirus pandemic. While politicians have been caught offering empty reassurances, the epidemiologists, a job title new to many, have emerged as the straight shooters of the crisis, sometimes to their detriment.And Ammon, a former adviser to the German government, speaks frankly in her first interview with a UK newspaper since the crisis began.Earlier this month the former hospital doctor, who worked through the various levels of healthcare bureaucracy to be become ECDC director in 2017, announced that, as of 2 May, Europe as a whole had passed the peak of infections. Only Poland was technically not yet there, she said.European governments have started easing their lockdown restrictions, some to the extent that bars and restaurants will soon reopen, others rather more tentatively. Boris Johnson has tweaked his message to Britons from “stay at home” to “stay alert” and is seeking to send pupils back into schools in a fortnight.Ammon’s job is to scrutinise the fallout and catch any rise in infections early. Talking through Skype from her kitchen at home, from where she has been working remotely for the last two months, she insists a disastrous second wave is not inevitable if people stick to the rules and keep their distance.But she detects an ominous weakening of the public’s resolve.“I think now it’s beginning to strain. What we see is that, on the one hand, the economic part for small and medium-sized businesses but also the experience of people not being able to exercise all the freedoms that we normally have: to go where we like, to be with whom we want to be. And this is a quite fundamental change to our normal way of life.Asked whether the data was showing any repercussions, Ammon gave a deadpan answer. “Not yet. I mean, maybe it doesn’t come ever, maybe all the adjustment of these measures is done in a prudent way. This is something we are really right now are closely monitoring: what is happening after all these measures.”As of Wednesday 158,134 people have died from Covid-19 in the EU and the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, according to ECDC data for the countries the agency monitors.The UK has the highest level of deaths in Europe, with 35,341, followed by Italy (32,169) and France (28,022).A total of 1,324,183 cases of infection have been reported. Among those is a member of Ammon’s own staff. Only a skeleton group of fewer than 10 now work in the agency’s office in Stockholm.“Part of our crisis team that needs to be there because they need very close cooperation. But they’re sitting wide apart. Honestly. We have to do what we preach.”Ammon recalls that it was only in late January that it had become clear that a novel virus causing a cluster of deaths in the Chinese city of Wuhan could be transmitted human to human, with initial concerns focusing on the possibility of the disease spreading through imports.As the extremely contagious nature of the virus emerged, the ECDC advised governments on 26 January to strengthen the capacities of their health services. There was fear of them being overwhelmed, as was shortly to be the case with tragic results in Lombardy in northern Italy.“We did really emphasise that these plans have to be updated. And in particular, the hospital preparedness needs to be looked at, how to make sure to have a surge capacity for beds, in general, but also in particular for intensive care unit beds.Ammon believes that when the inevitable inquiries look into the twists and turns of the crisis, the return of holidaymakers from Alpine skiing breaks in the first week of March will be seen as a pivotal moment in the spread of Covid-19 into Europe.Lockdowns followed – a theoretical possibility in the pandemic planning that few believed was feasible. “I remember when China put the lockdown to Wuhan, people told me, ‘Look this wouldn’t be possible in Europe.’ Hmm.”Now the lockdowns were straining the public’s tolerance, she said, but questioned whether they still came in too late and whether swifter action could have saved more lives. “I believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible, but … these measures are so stark, I mean they are so out of our experience that it, I think it needed … unfortunately the situation in northern Italy to make everybody clear that it is necessary.”Ammon now believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul. “I don’t know whether it’s forever but I don’t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans.”She is yet to book a summer holiday and warns those craving a break away to prepare for some disappointment. “What we are saying is that they should be prepared that even if there are some holidays and they go somewhere, it will not be comparable to what they had last year. At this stage we cannot say you can go out there, wash your hands and everything is fine. You have to keep your distance. These measures have to be in place.”But despite the privations of recent months, Ammon expresses little sympathy for the argument put forward by some, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption that merely shielding the elderly would have been sufficient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46dd3984907184a20e99216f9077b610f2c53c05/0_163_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b62523d6a0232b4b6773a659002001","title":"uk scientists must not be blamed coronavirus advice says royal society head","story":"Exclusive: intervention comes after minister appeared to scapegoat scientists over Covid-19 errorsScientists must be allowed to take independent decisions without fear of recriminations, the head of the Royal Society has warned after a cabinet minister appeared to blame “wrong” science for mistakes made in tackling the coronavirus pandemic.The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, made the comments while being challenged on the government’s response to the crisis, including what was done – or not - to protect care homes. She told Sky News: “If the science was wrong, advice at the time was wrong, I’m not surprised if people will then think we then made a wrong decision.”No 10 swiftly distanced itself from her comments but they raised concerns that members of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) were being hung out to dry.Sir Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, said: “The one thing that should not happen is if scientists feel that by giving very frank advice, they’re somehow going to be penalised or blamed later. That will inhibit them from being very frank and you don’t want to inhibit frankness from scientists because you really want to know what is their best estimate of what’s going on at the moment …“I would say this is not a healthy debate to have, I think, scientists should stick to advice and then it is for government to accept the advice and decide what to do with it.”The Nobel prize-winning biochemist said the government was right to disassociate itself from Coffey’s comments.“This isn’t to mean that scientists are always going to get everything right, far from it,” he said. “They will have got things wrong but the beauty of science is that as new evidence comes in you change your understanding of it. And in the end the only way to progress out of this pandemic is through science.”When faced with criticism of its handling of the pandemic, the government has consistently responded with the refrain that it is “following the science”. Ramakrishnan said that while that was possible in some instances, with physical distancing for example, when evidence of the benefits were clear, it was not always so simple.“The science is complicated and putting it into policies also complicated and so you can’t just say you’re following the science in every case,” he said. “I think what ministers should say is, ‘we’re heeding the science, we’re heeding the science advice, we’re considering it when we make our decisions’ – that would be a more honest thing.”A member of Sage, who did not want to be named, also stressed that decisions were ultimately the responsibility of ministers.“Politicians are in charge, and they decide what advice they get,” they said. “Scientists like me are invited to give advice and have no power to enact any decisions. They don’t have to accept the advice, and indeed should take a wider view than the science when making decisions – they are elected by the population to take decisions on our behalf.”He told the : “Science just isn’t like that and so the idea that they were following the science was wrong. And now that they’ve been criticised for their steps they have taken, it is bizarre that they’ve tried to say that it was wrong science that led them astray rather than their own decisions.”Stevens said that, during his time advising the government on drugs policy, he had seen civil servants “tell ministers the story they want to be told”. He highlighted comments by Prof John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who advises Sage on infectious modelling, saying they did not carry out detailed modelling for a lockdown originally “because it didn’t seem to be on the agenda”, as “politics leading the science rather than the other way around”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258330.1589987244!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"debenhams workers urge minister to intervene with liquidators","story":"Debenhams workers protest on Henry Street in Dublin, urging Government to intervene to save more than 2,000 jobs in the department store and associated companies.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsDebenhams workers protested outside Leinster House on Wednesday urging Minister for Employment Affairs Regina Doherty to intervene with the appointed liquidators.More than 30 workers gathered on Kildare Street, while maintaining social distance, with signs stating “workers must be prioritised” and “prevent Clerys mark 2”.They called on the Minister to intervene and engage with KPMG, the liquidators appointed and the UK parent company to extend consultation. Ms Doherty is due to answer questions on the issue in the Dáil later today.The workers were notified by email last month that the company’s 11 Irish stores were closing. They are calling on Debenhams to honour a previous agreement to pay two weeks’ redundancy per year of service, in addition to statutory redundancy.Debenhams Retail Ireland Ltd announced on April 16th that it had applied to the court for the appointment of a provisional liquidator and that its 957 employees would be laid off.Staff are planning to prevent stock being removed from stores and warehouses after workers from the union Mandate voted to strike.Mairéad Fullam, a personal shopper at Debenhams Henry Street store for 24 years, said: “The Minister has to engage with them otherwise it’s the Irish taxpayer who’s going to pick up the bill for these 1,500 people that were employed.“People are really angry with the treatment we have gotten. We are going to keep up this protest and we’re going to block all the shops with the stock in them, to stop them removing that stock and bringing it to the UK.“Those blockades could be any time from Friday, we’re just waiting on the word to go and we will block them. We’re just not taking no for an answer.”Suzanne Sherry worked at the same store in administration for more than 20 years.“We’re looking for Minister Doherty to intervene and stop the liquidation going ahead and to investigate the case,” she said.“We’re all really upset and devastated after working there for so long. We just feel hurt. The biggest thing for me is I now feel like we didn’t know who we were working for in the last few years.”‘Can these jobs be saved?’Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger said “this liquidation should never have been allowed happen in the first place”.The Dublin West TD added that “to permit a company to enter a liquidation process during an international pandemic is outrageous. Why has the Minister or nobody from this Government lifted up the phone to either the liquidator or Debenhams to explore whether these jobs can be saved?“Why has the State shown no interest in investing in the order of €20 million to save these jobs, when the alternative is a €20 million-plus bill for putting these workers on the dole? Not one single measure has been implemented to stop a jobs massacre throughout the retail sector.”Labour TD Ged Nash said Fine Gael continues to “abandon workers” caught up in liquidations.“The entire country was scandalised at the treatment of the Clerys workers in 2015,” he said. “The State swore that never again would citizens be discarded and treated the way in which the Clerys workers were. They were left on the side of the road on O’Connell Street on a Friday afternoon, dependent on the State to step in and pay their redundancies.”The Louth TD said the Duffy-Cahill review in 2016 recommended important changes which “Fine Gael still refuses to implement”.“As sure as night follows day, businesses will use the cover of the pandemic to restructure their operations, putting jobs and suppliers at risk and moving assets out of the reach of those who are owed money,” he added.“Never was the need for such protections more essential. The Minister for Employment Affairs needs once and for all to do the right thing, change the law and empower her own department to seize back the money the taxpayer will inevitably have to fork out to pay statutory redundancy entitlements of Debenham’s workers and possibly many thousands more workers who may end up being caught up in insolvencies in light of the Covid-19 emergency.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258083.1589992285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus call to partially reopen primary schools in june","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tony Holohan: Department of Education is focused on a September return for schools. Photograph: Getty Parents’ representatives have called for primary schools to be partially reopened in mid-June if it is safe to do so.Áine Lynch, chief executive of the National Parents’ Council Primary, said the decision to keep schools closed until September was made at a time when public health conditions were worse than they are now.She called on public health authorities to keep official advice under constant review to consider whether schools could open to sixth-class students, for example, in mid-June. Ms Lynch said these students face a big transition to second-level education and would benefit from school support, if it is safe to do so.Moreover, she said it would allow public health authorities to measure the potential impact on infection rates of a return to school.“We’re seeing what’s happening other jurisdictions,” said Ms Lynch. “We hope that rather than leaving it to phase five of the roadmap, the National Public Health Emergency Team continually reviews the advice to see if something can be done earlier.”However, Minister for Health Simon Harris has ruled out sixth-class primary school returning to the classroom before going on to second level. Some parents have requested that older children be allowed return to school to aid their transition to second level and also because they could understand physical distancing. In a video posted on YouTube, Mr Harris said: “We are planning on getting our schools open for the new school year. They won’t open before that.” He acknowledged that many schools will be scheduling virtual graduations in lieu of traditional end-of-year events.“I know how difficult this has been . . . I do promise you this, that there will be brighter days ahead . . . hopefully, you will get to see your friends in some guise over the summer months.” Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation (WHO) special envoy on Covid-19 has said it is now time to think about reopening schools in Ireland.Dr David Nabarro said he remains hopeful a vaccine can be found but that in the meantime getting used to living with the virus is going to be the new normal.Keeping children home from school for too long can have long-term effects on their development, he warned, speaking to Newstalk Breakfast.“You have to balance the risk. Children staying at home, missing school – that is going to have a long-term impact on their future ability to earn and to be strong in society . . . children, although they can get the virus, are not anything like as important at spreading the virus as some other members of the population. So we have got to give it a try,” he said. However, Dr Nabarro said before schools reopen teachers must be confident they can manage the return to school and that children understand social distancing.Schools had reopened in other countries while managing to keep students and staff safe, he said.“So, I am thinking the time has come, especially as you have got the numbers of cases being suppressed and you have got the defences building up, the time has come to gradually start reopening schools.”Given Ireland’s progress on suppressing the virus to date, Dr Nabarro said it was likely there were going to be people in Government who will start thinking “very, very seriously” that schools could be reopened soon. September returnBut he added that he had to be careful not to “overstep” his remit as a WHO representative.On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Department of Health said it was still planning for schools to reopen and operate in September, in line with public health advice. “Engagement is underway with stakeholders in the education sector to develop contingency plans for the re-opening and operation of schools in an environment that may require social distancing and other public health requirements,” the spokesman said.“This work will be based on the national return to work safely protocol and will also be informed by guidance and experience from other jurisdictions. A core objective of the contingency plans will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.”Earlier this month, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the Department of Education is focused on a September return for schools and that he does “not anticipate” they will open before that date.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on May 13th that “among the safest things” the State can do in the coming months is to reopen schools for children, raising fresh questions over the timeline for reopening schools and childcare facilities.The document says pupils may end up having to physically attend school on a limited basis, such as every other day or every other week, and learn remotely on the remaining days. An extended week is also mooted as a possibility."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Reducing use of fertiliser and antibiotics also on agenda in bid to safeguard environmentLockdown effect, dropping to levels last seen in 2006, greater than previous estimatesThis novel alliance could take some getting used to.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Thirty years ago McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in the Soviet Union. Thousands turned up to the grand opening in Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square and the crowds kept coming for weeks afterwards.For many observers at the time, it symbolised the end of the Cold War and the embrace of capitalist values in the communist East.The reopening of six McDonald’s drive-thrus in Dublin hardly represents an epoch moment in world history, but for those queuing for the return of the Big Mac it meant a glimpse of normality after months of lockdown.McDonald’s tried to keep the openings low-key, but when word got out that a few restaurants were reopening at 11am, albeit on a very limited basis, the cars started to descend on the Dublin restaurants involved - Nutgrove, East Wall, Artane, Malahide, Kylemore Road and Tallaght.Staff wore face masks and there were perspex screens at the drive thru windows - though a drive thru was a form of social distancing before the concept was created.Some might sniff that McDonald’s is a symbol of our calorific and consumerist lifestyle, but who cares when you have been cooped up at home for weeks on end?Cars that turned up early to the McDonald’s in Kylemore Road, Dublin were turned away as the car park was not open. A few parked on the verges outside. As soon as the bollards went down, the cars streamed in.Within a few minutes they were backed up on the Kylemore Road right up and around the corner to the very busy Naas Road which is one of the main approach roads into Dublin. At one stage gardaí arrived to sort out the congestion.Many queued in overheated cars for a half-an-hour for a menu that was limited by necessity as not all McDonald’s staff have returned to work yet.Most of the early-birds were mothers with their children. Deprived of the rhythms of school, the promise of a McDonald’s is no longer the mundane treat it used to be.At the front of the queue Danielle Gannon brought her children Holly (9) and Aidan (9) to get happy meals.“Everything has been taken from them. When I heard it was open, I said, ‘why not?’ They can’t go to playgrounds. It’s been tough on the kids. They weren’t missing school at the start - it was a novelty, but now they are dying to get back to normal and so am I.”Elaine Smith turned up with her daughter Kelly (20). Elaine just wanted to get the McDonald’s coffee “that’s my normal school run and I miss it” while Kelly was getting chicken nuggets and chips.Sinead Fleet and her son Scott (9) came down after a visit to Crumlin children’s hospital where he was getting a procedure done. Her son, who has Down Syndrome, beamed as he clutched the familiar brown bag with its yellow arches.“He heard about the chips. It’s his favourite things. It’s great to have some bit of normality back for him. That’s the first bit of normality for him. It’s been very tough without any services or schooling,” she said.McDonald’s intends to open the rest of its drive thrus in Ireland in early June."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Parents\u0026rsquo group calls for primary schools to be partially reopened in mid-June if safe to do so\u0026lsquoObviously I didn\u0026rsquot like the protocol at all but we have to make sure we minimise it\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash FosterCovid-19 fatality rates North and South comparable, says NI health ministerVictim sustains wounds to leg and has been taken to hospital after treatment at the sceneCentre at former Skellig Hotel has had outbreak of Covid-19Alleged incident by 63-year-old involved garda\u0026iacute at popular visitor attraction in Cork cityCatherine Martin thanked members \u0026lsquowho have asked me to contest\u0026rsquo party leadershipNational Parents\u0026rsquo Council Primary urges review, but Harris rules out sixth-class returnNew social distancing advice is \u0026lsquobordering on bizarre\u0026rsquo, says solicitors\u0026rsquo groupA \u0026lsquopod\u0026rsquo system of small playgroups and regular hand-washing is envisaged but not facemasksRegina Doherty called on to engage with KPMG and advise extending consultationsS\u0026eacuteamus Cotter was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer at the age of 46, but is now clearBanks moving into position of \u0026lsquoconsiderable losses\u0026rsquo, Paschal Donohoe tells D\u0026aacuteilLawrence Mubango (31) tried to steal \u0026euro7,500 from Mary\u0026rsquos Pub in Dublin city centre\u0026lsquoWhen I heard it was open, I said, \u0026lsquowhy not?\u0026rsquo The lockdown has been \u0026lsquotough on the kids\u0026rsquoIrish Hospice Foundation calls for \u0026lsquoa national response\u0026rsquo to end of life care after pandemicSharp rise in cases at Irish meat plants to 828 is concerning, says senior health officialStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258488.1589998761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup leader demands gove s key brexit commitments be honoured","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the degree of ‘clarity’ provided by Michael Gove in his House of Commons statement. Photograph:  Yui MokPA WireBritish Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove’s key commitments on the Northern Ireland protocol must be “unmovable foundational positions” for the British government to honour, DUP leader Arlene Foster has demanded.First Minister Ms Foster, who opposed the Brexit withdrawal agreement British prime minister Boris Johnson struck with the European Union, welcomed the degree of “clarity” provided by Mr Gove in his House of Commons statement.Ms Foster said Mr Gove’s four main commitments must be adhered to by the British government.The Ulster Unionist Party and the Traditional Unionist Voice party, however, expressed concerns about the commitments with TUV leader Jim Allister complaining of “Brexit betrayal”.Customs infrastructureWhile Mr Gove said “there would be no new customs infrastructure in Northern Ireland”, he also indicated there would be “some expansion of existing infrastructure to provide for some additional new processes for the agriculture and food sector”.He added that “these processes will build on what already happens at ports like Larne and Belfast”.Ms Foster said she would prefer “no checks at all” but accepted there already were some checks on agri-products coming into Northern Ireland.“Obviously I didn’t like the protocol at all but we have to make sure we minimise it as much as possible,” Ms Foster told the Northern Assembly Executive Office scrutiny committee when commenting on Mr Gove’s document.“I’m very pleased to see it talks about the unfettered access from Northern Ireland into the rest of the UK market,” she said.Ms Foster added: “There won’t be any tariffs paid on goods that are moving between parts of the UK, there won’t be any new customs infrastructure – that is good news as well – and that, of course, we’ll benefit from any new trade deals.”The UUP leader Steve Aiken, however, said Mr Gove’s statement didn’t “provide the absolute certainty which businesses need and they certainly won’t assuage the concerns of unionists” that more infrastructure would be built at Northern Ireland ports.“The UK government now needs to stand up and defend the interests of Northern Ireland in continued negotiations with the EU,” he said.“The public words of government ministers in the past haven’t matched their subsequent actions. It’s time they did,” added Mr Aiken.Repeated assurancesTUV leader Mr Allister said as he had “repeatedly warned government assurances about there not being a border in the Irish Sea have proven to be false”.“It is betrayal of the highest order, made all the worse by repeated assurances that it would not happen,” he said.Sinn Féin South Down MP Chris Hazzard said it was “clear the British government is planning for Border control posts and checks at ports of entry in the North for agri-food goods coming from Britain and elsewhere outside the EU”.Mr Hazzard, who said this demonstrated the “fork-tongued approach of the British government”, called for the December 31st Brexit deadline to be extended, as did the SDLP Brexit spokesman, Matthew O’Toole.He said Mr Gove’s “document is typically replete with sweeping assertions and promises, but precious little detail on how these will be delivered”.“No one in Northern Ireland can be in any doubt about the value of promises from Boris Johnson’s government,” added South Belfast MLA Mr O’Toole.Alliance MP and deputy leader Stephen Farry also said the transition period must be extended “given the need to focus on the Covid-19 crisis and its economic fallout”.Dr Farry said it was “important to recall the protocol is the sad and inevitable outcome of the UK government’s decision to pursue a hard Brexit over the heads of the people of Northern Ireland”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248767.1588960054!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catherine martin classical singer who takes up green baton in coalition talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin:  uneasy about an alliance with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Photograph: Laura HuttonGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan’s choice of Catherine Martin to lead the party’s negotiating team in Government formation talks has led to comparisons with Éamon de Valera choosing Michael Collins to lead Treaty negotiations.No death warrants or anything dramatic like that, but some see it as presaging a damaging split in a party which prides itself on a karmic approach to politics.The Dublin Rathdown TD and deputy leader has emerged as the leading figure of a minority in the parliamentary party who have been uneasy about an alliance with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.She is a surprising figurehead. She is not a left-wing firebrand like Saoirse McHugh or Cork councillor Lorna Bogue. She is centre-left at most, and would be seen as a natural collaborator who has forged good relations across all parties. She founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas and also pressed for anti-bullying protocols and structures in the Leinster House campus.Those close to her say she is not opposed per se to coalition, but wanted cast-iron guarantees way beyond those Ryan was prepared to accept.Her stance is said to have strained the previously close working relationship between them.Taught musicFrom Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan, Martin trained as a classical singer and performed nationally when younger. After graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.She had briefly flirted with politics. Her brother Vincent P Martin (now a senior counsel and Green councillor in Kildare) was an Independent councillor in Monaghan in the 1990s. She was co-opted to his seat for a while but then left politics. She and her husband, architect Francis Noel Duffy (now also a Green TD) decided to become involved in the Greens after starting a family a decade ago.Martin was elected a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016. She did it with an unstinting “boots on the ground” effort, canvassing every home numerous times. As the party’s second TD, it took a long while for her to emerge from the shadow of the high-profile Ryan. She is cautious by nature. “Every decision is thoroughly researched and she seeks advice widely. She does not say things lightly,” says a former colleague.Initially, she focused on strong suits such as education and Irish, but as time went on began to front on more issues.Some in the party find it hard to gauge where she stands. “I am never really sure what her politics are,” says one colleague. “At the moment she seems to be aligning herself with the young Greens and the Saoirse McHugh end.”‘Big stand’A supporter says, “This was a big stand for her. She could have sat on the fence. These are two parties who would buy and sell you in a second.”Her ferocious denunciation of Simon Coveney on RTÉ last week would have bolstered her standing with the doubters. It also showed her objections ran beyond climate change to a wider left-wing agenda.In the end, she was in a minority of three out of 12 TDs, along with her husband, Duffy and Neasa Hourigan (Patrick Costello abstained). Her appointment was a no-brainer. Given the deputy leaders from the two other parties are lead negotiators, if Ryan had not chosen her, it would have spelled “serious split”. She has said strongly she accepts the decision and will negotiate in good faith.Is there a bigger game at play? The party’s leadership must be decided within six months of the election. The party’s membership profile is younger and more radical. Some in the parliamentary party believe she has ambitions to be leader.“I would not be surprised if she runs,” says a supporter. “Eamon Ryan has had a long stint. He is bright and full of integrity but is he right strategically?”But is she? Time will tell.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258204.1589993192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green deputy leader giving serious consideration to challenging ryan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan with his deputy,   Catherine Martin. Photograph: Alan BetsonGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin has said she is giving “serious consideration” to standing against Eamon Ryan but said any contest must wait until after the current government formation process is concluded.In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Ms Martin said: “Thank you to the Green Party members who have asked me to step up and contest the upcoming leadership election.“Members and their volunteerism are, as we know, the lifeblood and democratic heartbeat of our party and I will therefore give this serious consideration over the coming number of days.“However, my focus remains on the crucial government formation talks. In the event of a leadership contest arising, I believe it is important that government formation talks fully conclude uninterrupted and that any leadership campaign happens subsequently.“In the meantime I will continue to give my all to leading these negotiations while also listening to our membership about the future direction of our party and my role in it.”Green Party rules say a leadership election must be held within six months of a general election. The 2020 general election was held in February.Nominations for the position opened on Wednesday, and the final date for nominations is June 7th. A period of hustings and debates will follow, with postal ballots sent to members on July 1st.Ballot papers must be returned by July 22nd, with the count taking place the following day.Carlow Kilkenny TD Malcolm Noonan said Mr Ryan has his “full support” and that the Dublin Bay South TD had picked the party “off the floor” following the 2011 general election, when the party lost all six of its Dáil seats. It now has 12 seats.Dublin West’s Roderic O’Gorman also said Mr Ryan will have his full support if there is a contest.Waterford TD Marc Ó Cathasaigh said questions around the leadership are an “unwelcome distraction from the important job of work we have in front of us at the moment”.“Eamon has led us from our lowest ebb to our best ever electoral results in both local and national elections,” he said. “Now is not an opportune time to consider changing leadership.”Wicklow TD Steven Mathews also said Mr Ryan has his support, as did Senator Pippa Hackett.Clare councillor Roisín Garvey said: “Now is not the time to be discussing leadership of any kind.”Both Ms Martin and Mr Ryan attended negotiations on climate policy on Tuesday, where all parties reaffirmed their commitment to the Greens’ goal of reducing carbon emissions by 7 per cent per year. However, it is understood discussions on what such a target means in policy terms will not begin until later this week.Meanwhile, Cork city and county Green Party councillors Oliver Moran, Colette Finn, Lorna Bogue and Liam Quaide have written to Ms Martin to encourage her to challenge Mr Ryan’s leadership.In an interview with the Opinion Line, on Cork’s 96FM, Cllr Bogue emphasised that it was not a question of them having no confidence in Mr Ryan.“We are all very grateful to Eamon and we think he has done a really brilliant job over the last 10 years bringing us to the position where we currently are at,” she said.“When people start looking at leadership elections people think it is all very House of Cards. It isn’t at all. It is actually just about having the best person for the role.”She said the people who wrote the party constitution could never have foreseen a situation where the country would be six months from an election and without a government.A potential candidate only needs the support of 50 members to enter the leadership race. The Greens have 2,700 members, up from 700 two years ago.Sources say that nominations will open in the coming days and that more than 100 members have already contacted party officials suggesting that Ms Martin should stand."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Cyclone Amphan moving inland with gusts of up to 185kmh, says India met serviceSuper cyclone Amphan, with winds up to 160kmh, expected to hit India\u0026rsquos coast on WednesdayRules to be relaxed in areas with low numbers of infection, according to governmentIf Travis McCready\u0026rsquos US event goes ahead, it will look very different from typical rock gigsCity looks asymptomatic carriers after confirming first Covid cluster last weekend since release from lockdownLeader missed out on a seat as the venue was too full under Covid-19 restrictionsSecond most senior figure in Tibetan Buddhism was taken into custody when he was sixAid groups warn a humanitarian disaster looms in camps housing one million peopleBusinesses wrestle with capacity issues and lockdown debts as restrictions easeAttacks this week, including on maternity unit in Kabul, leave process hanging by threadAustralian arm of Genesis II group who wrote to Donald Trump fined $150,000City where pandemic began have reported first infections since lockdown was liftedChengdu Letter: History is repeating itself as Chinese officials threaten bereaved against legal actionRiot police intervene as renewed concern over Chinese power revives movementDean of hospital in Mumbai blamed families for not collecting the bodies of loved onesSouth Korean officials attribute new outbreak to one person who visited several barsBreaches of city-state\u0026rsquos strict lockdown rules can result in hefty fines and even jailDestruction increased 64 per cent in April, compared with the same month a year agoAuthorities double evacuation area around factory after about 800 people hospitalisedLockdown sees tens of thousands walking home after being laid off in large citiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4258202.1589989718!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no customs infrastructure needed in north says uk brexit paper","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe UK has said they will expand some entry points for agrifood goodsThe British government has ruled out any new customs infrastructure at ports on either side of the Irish Sea to implement the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol.In a paper outlining how it will implement the protocol, which was agreed alongside the withdrawal agreement last year, the government also said there would be no requirement for export declarations for goods moving from the North to Great Britain.“At the heart of our proposals is a consensual, pragmatic approach that will protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the huge gains from the peace process. Implementing the protocol in this way will ensure we can support businesses and citizens, and protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s customs territory, while upholding our commitments to the EU’s Single Market.“Northern Ireland will benefit fully from its access to the UK and EU markets. The whole of the United Kingdom will be able to capitalise on the opportunities that will come from forging our own path and striking new free trade agreements with countries around the world,” cabinet office minister Michael Gove said.A spokesman for the Tánaiste Simon Coveney said that the Irish government was “studying the UK government statement closely.”“But the obligations of both the UK and the EU are written in black and white in the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement, while the ambition for the future is laid out in the political declaration,” he said.Mr Coveney is expected to give further reaction later today.Destination of goodsUnder the protocol, Northern Ireland remains part of the UK’s customs territory but EU customs rules apply to all goods entering the North unless they are determined not to be at risk of moving on into the EU single market. But the British paper envisages a system that would presume that goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are destined to remain there.“Tariffs should only be charged if goods are destined for Ireland or the EU Single Market more broadly, or if there is a genuine and substantial risk of them ending up there. If a supplier in Great Britain sends goods to a business for sale in Northern Ireland, then that is internal UK trade. Raw produce from Great Britain for agri-food processing in Northern Ireland which is then sent back to Great Britain is another good example of trade which is internal and has no impact on the EU market. A supermarket delivering to its stores in Northern Ireland poses no ‘risk’ to the EU market whatsoever, and no tariffs would be owed for such trade,” it says.ConsentMr Gove said that is was important for an approach to be designed which will continue to “command consent”.Conservative former prime minister Theresa May told the Commons: “Will (Mr Gove) confirm that as from January 1st, 2021, that Northern Ireland — ie a part of the United Kingdom — will be required to follow EU regulations on certain goods until at least 2024 and potentially indefinitely?”Mr Gove responded: “If the workings of the protocol are viewed by the people and the parties of Northern Ireland as onerous, too much, intrusive and unacceptable, then they have the opportunity to vote them down in 2024, which is why it is so important that we design an approach which can continue to command consent.”Leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood said on Twitter that the British government had shown a “a lack of understanding of the unique circumstances” in Northern Ireland, and included a link to the Belfast Agreement.Democratic Unionist Party MP Sammy Wilson said the withdrawal agreement and its arrangements for Northern Ireland would “always be offensive to unionists”.AgrifoodThe document acknowledges that more infrastructure will have to be put in place to increase inspections on animals and agrifood but stresses that “there will be no construction at points of entry where no plant or animal health checks are currently carried out”.The protocol requires manufactured goods on the market in Northern Ireland to satisfy EU regulations but the British document says the same regulatory authorities would continue to enforce the rules.“The EU have previously noted that any regulatory checks required for industrial goods can take place through market surveillance authorities at business premises or on the market, and do not have to take place at ports. This would be on the basis of risk assessment, which we will look to carefully utilise, both by taking a pragmatic view of the risk posed by goods from Great Britain, and by lowering their risk profile through increased on-the-market activity.

A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"national trust properties taken orcas otters bats rare birds","story":"Wildlife has taken over National Trust properties after they were shut to the public at the beginning of lockdown in March.Now, the organisation is cautiously re-opening some venues, with car park spaces booking up days ahead on the first day the system opened.However, rangers at the sites have enjoyed seeing nature spring into areas which once were busy with humans. Badger cubs have been gamboling in car parks and rare birds including a grasshopper warbler have been seen in areas which are usually busy with dog walkers, which scare away shy animals.Other reports from rangers and gardeners include peregrine falcons nesting in the ancient ruins of Corfe Castle in Dorset for the first time in 40 years, English partridges wandering in an empty car park near Cambridge, and a cuckoo calling at Osterley in west London, having not been heard there for 20 years.David Brown, National Trust ecologist at Corfe Castle, said: “This is the first time peregrines have nested here since the 1980s. With the site the quietest it has ever been, the great curtain walls are an ideal spot for these powerful birds, which look for isolated and inaccessible places to build a nest. Amongst all the uncertainty, it has been heartening to see nature colonising the landscape in our absence.”   On Friday, two male orca were seen in Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, and were believed to have travelled in the quieter waters down from the Hebrides.The lakes and gardens, usually thronged with visitors, are now full of curious creatures. Little Owls have been spotted at Ham House, London, and at Plas yn Rhiw, on the Llyn Peninsula, stoats, weasels and hares have come in from the woodland to explore the gardens. Otters too have been spotted enjoying the quiet at Nunnington Hall in Yorkshire and Mount Stewart in County Down, with those at the Northern Ireland site travelling from the lough to explore the lake in the grounds of the neo-classical house. The National Trust is slowly reopening sites, with customers having to pre-book car parking spaces online. Spaces at Nostell, West Yorkshire and Wicken Fen Nature Reserve, Cambridgeshire already sold out until more spaces are released next week.Mo Metcalf-Fisher of the Countryside Alliance said “The countryside thrives when people are able to get out and explore it. As it gradually opens up again, we need to ensure visitors from across the country are signposted to the right places in a way that’s manageable- certainly in the early days as it will inevitably be a rush. Car parks should be opening across the countryside to ensure there isn’t overspill in just a handful of select few places. Central to visiting the countryside comes safety and respect for the countryside code, as it is a home and workplace to so many.”Ben McCarthy, head of conservation at the charity, said that people need to be careful of the rejuvenated wildlife when they come to visit.He said: We would ask everyone who visits to be especially mindful of the wildlife around them.“Over the last few weeks we’ve seen endangered birds, as well as more common wildlife, expanding their territories and nesting in places they wouldn’t normally.“As the lockdown begins to be eased, we all need to play our part to ensure that this wildlife remains undisturbed.“By sticking to paths, keeping dogs under control, not approaching wildlife and taking any litter home, we can ensure our places benefit both people and nature.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rspb volunteers repatriated remote island 12 day boat journey","story":"Among the thousands of enforced journeys home from abroad when the coronavirus crisis hit, few would have been as arduous as that made by a group of bird charity volunteers.Twelve RSPB conservationists, including three Britons, had been looking after the rare albatrosses on Gough Island, one of the most remote locations in the world, around 1,700 miles off the southern tip of Africa.The British Overseas Territory, home to 24 species of rare bird, is overrun with giant mice, which eat the eggs and kill young birds, wiping out as many as two million a year. The rangers had been laying pest poison, and monitoring the unusual animals on Gough.When the crisis broke, they contacted the Foreign Office, and officials worked out an 18-day route, the quickest available, involving first abseiling down the steep cliffs of Gough, then a 12-day sea voyage of nearly 2,000 nautical miles before a five-day layover on Ascension Island waiting to be airlifted back to Brize Norton – via Cape Verde.Kate Lawrence, one of the group, said: “Sailing in that boat for 12 days, looking at the endless blue ocean around me, made the world feel quite big, in contrast to the previous ease of air travel, and the rapid spread of Covid-19, which makes the world seem so small.”When the stranded group originally requested help, multiple routes for them to return home were considered. As the closest, South Africa was the most obvious destination, but rapidly developing travel restrictions there soon ruled it out.The Falklands were seen as the next-best option, but it was at least a 20-day sail away on the expedition yacht, the Evohe, against prevailing winds, and in deteriorating weather conditions.Ms Lawrence added: “We knew the team back in the UK were working on a plan, though the information and plan seemed to change almost daily due to the ever-changing border closures and travel restrictions around the world.”Andrew Callender, programme executive of the RSPB Gough Project, said: “We received incredible support throughout the repatriation process from members of the FCO, the High Commissioner in South Africa and various administrators and representatives of the Overseas Territories, especially in the Falklands and Ascension.”Despite their exhausting and stressful journey, the team hopes to return to Gough next year to save the critically endangered Tristan Albatross from the mice, which were accidentally introduced by humans.They are hoping to raise the finance to continue the mission to eradicate the rodents entirely from the island.Michelle Risi, who works for the RSPB and lives permanently on the island, said: “It was amazing to see how people from all around the world united and bonded. Unfortunately, this time has now come to an end. For us remaining, we are sorry to see their friendly faces go as we prepare for another winter on Gough, which will unfortunately consist of documenting another year of mice impact on Gough’s winter breeders.”     More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"astronomers discover first evidence new planet born gathering","story":"Astronomers believe they may have found the first direct evidence of a new planet being born.A dense disc of dust and gas has been spotted surrounding a young star called AB Aurigae, around 520 light years away from Earth.Using the European Southern Observatory\u0027s Very Large Telescope (VLT), located in Chile, the researchers observed a spiral structure with a twist near the centre, which suggests a new world may be in the process of forming.The swirling disc is one of the telltale signs of the star system being born in the constellation of Auriga, the scientists said.Dr Anthony Boccaletti, who led the study from the Observatoire de Paris, PSL University, France, said: Thousands of exoplanets have been identified so far, but little is known about how they form.He added: We need to observe very young systems to really capture the moment when planets form.Until now astronomers had been unable to take clear images of young discs to see these twists.Dr Boccaletti and his team of astronomers used VLT\u0027s Sphere instrument to take photos of AB Aurigae, which show a stunning spiral of dust caused by the baby planet trying to kick the gas.The same instrument was used in 2018 to take photos of another infant planet, thought to be just 5.4 million years old.According Emmanuel Di Folco, of the Astrophysics Laboratory (LAB) of Bordeaux in France and one of the study authors, this so-called kicking phenomenon causes disturbances in the disc in the form of a wave, somewhat like the wake of a boat on a lake.As the new planet rotates around AB Aurigae, it causes the surrounding gas and dust to be shaped into a spiral arm.The very bright yellow region near the centre of the spiral is the twist, which lies at about the same distance from the star as Neptune from the Sun.Anne Dutrey, also at LAB and a study co-author, said: The twist is expected from some theoretical models of planet formation.It corresponds to the connection of two spirals - one winding inwards of the planet\u0027s orbit, the other expanding outwards - which join at the planet location.They allow gas and dust from the disc to accrete onto the forming planet and make it grow.The observations are reported in the journal Astronomy \u0026amp Astrophysics.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"councils move block 250000 pupils returning school june 1","story":"More than a quarter of a million children could be prevented from going back to school by local councils refusing to open classrooms on June 1.Sixteen English councils have said they will support local headteachers in any decision to stay closed, while a further ten have directly advised schools not to open.The Government has asked primary schools to open for reception classes and Years One and Six on June 1, and argues that the risk of transmission of coronavirus between pupils is low.Dr David Nabarro, a leading expert at the World Health Organisation (WHO), said it was safe for children to return to the classroom.Analysis by the  shows as many as a quarter of a million students in more than 2,500 schools could be prevented from going back to school by council opposition to the Government’s request.Many of the councils that have refused to order schools to open are in Labour-controlled northern cities, including Manchester, Leeds and Sunderland.Hartlepool, Rochedale and Calderdale have all advised schools not to open, while Sefton and Stockport councils have set later opening dates for headteachers to follow.Bradford and Wakefield councils, which oversee some of the worst Ofsted-rated schools in the country, both said schools were free to remain closed.Cllr Tamoor Tariq, Bury Council\u0027s lead member for education, said schools in the area would not open.“While high levels of Covid-19 infection in the North West remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be reopening schools on June 1,” he said.James Daly and Christian Wakeford, Bury’s local MPs, said the council had no power to keep schools closed.They accused Cllr Tariq of “political grandstanding” and said his opinion “does not appear to be based on any scientific or clinical advice”.“We believe that any statement should be made in an open and transparent manner, based upon the best evidence available to local leaders and would urge Cllr Tariq and the council to publish this advice before making a decisionrecommendation of this nature,” the MPs said in a letter to headteachers.The Local Government Association, which represents most local authorities in England, said councils should be able to see up-to-date figures on local rates of infection of the virus before schools are permitted to reopen.Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the Education Select Committee, said students across the UK were “potentially having their life chances destroyed” by being forced to stay at home.“I understand that there is worry about risk, which is minimal according to the WHO and the Children’s Commissioner, and many other studies in 22 EU countries, who have said that it is safe to send children back to school,” he told The .“But what about the risk to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable children who are not being educated who are potentially having their life chances destroyed, facing safeguarding crises and educational poverty for years to come?”The news comes as the head of an academy chain of seven schools in York said they would close for one day a week for deep cleaning after June 1.A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing.“Plans for a cautious, phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice.

Germany took such steps on the same day, but had reported only 86 fatalities at that time. The UK\u0027s death toll has now exceeded 35,000 people. Modelling from British scientist James Annan suggests that entering lockdown a week earlier would have reduced the number of deaths by three-quarters.Mr Annan, from Blueskiesresearch.org.uk, said an earlier lockdown would have been shorter and had less economic impact. In a related blog, he wrote: Implementing the lockdown one week earlier would have saved about 30,000 lives in the current wave (based on official numbers, which are themselves a substantial underestimate). It would also have made for a shorter, cheaper, less damaging lockdown in economic terms.Modellers said the calculations showed that even small changes in the timing of interventions could make a significant difference. Dr Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, said: In the early stages of an epidemic, the number of cases is growing exponentially. This means even a small change in the rate of spread or in the timing of interventions can make a big difference a short period of time down the line.It is clear that, had we locked down sooner, we would have reduced the spread earlier, limiting the number of cases and consequently the number of deaths. The other benefit of locking down earlier would have been bringing cases under control sooner and potentially allowing the release of lockdown sooner.The modelling was revealed on Radio 4\u0027s More or Less programme, which highlighted differences in the testing regimes used by different countries earlier in the epidemic, with Germany carrying out 50,000 tests daily at a time when the UK could not even achieve that weekly. As a result, at the point both countries entered lockdown, Germany had identified around 27,000 cases, when the UK had confirmed just 9,000, researchers said. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

lectures online go ahead.Up to 23 per cent of prospective students said they would no longer want to take up a place at university this autumn if it is not “operating as usual”, according to a report by London Economics for the University and College Union (UCU).This would mean an estimated 120,000 students may delay attending British campuses when the academic year begins in September and October.The poll of over 500 university applicants asked whether they still intended to go to university this year if classes were to be held virtually, campus activities were severely restricted and social distancing measures remained in place.Usually around six per cent of students defer their places, Ucas data shows, but report found that an additional 17 per cent planned to this year.Dr Gavan Conlon, a partner at London Economics said their analysis shows that there is a “huge amount of uncertainty” amongst prospective students about whether they will take up university places this year.He added that if over a fifth of British students defer their university places, the financial consequences facing universities will be “even more severe” than previously anticipated.Universities are already anticipating a drop in the number of international students this year due to the coronavirus pandemic, meaning that institutions face a significant black hole in their finances.British and European Union students pay up to £9,250 each year in tuition fees, but overseas students are charged around double this amount and the money they bring in is used to subsidise research.The London Economics report also suggests there is a 25 per cent chance that applicants will consider switching institutions through the clearing process.This week Cambridge announced that there will be no face-to-face lectures next academic year.   The 800-year-old university said that since it is likely that social distancing measures will continue, lectures will take place virtually instead.  Tutorials and smaller classes could take place in person, provided they can conform to social distancing requirements, a spokesman for the university said.Earlier this month, Manchester University said that it will move lectures online for the first semester of next year.The University of Glasgow also said large-scale lectures would be impractical at the start of the autumn term if the two-metre social distancing rule remains in place.  Others are likely to follow suit, following the Government’s latest advice that social distancing measures will need to stay in place for the foreseeable future.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the higher education watchdog the Office for Students, said that universities must tell prospective students with “absolute clarity” how courses will be taught next year.She said that institutions should be “as clear as they can be to students” on the type of teaching they can expect before they accept places in June.Ms Dandridge warned universities against making any misleading promises to school leavers about a campus experience if it turns out that this is “not the case”.Over 300,000 students have already signed a petition called for their tuition fees for the current academic year to be refunded as they say that remote learning should not cost up to £9,250-per-year.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and

adults are the most likely age group to be infected with coronavirus, new figures suggest. Snapshot surveillance data suggests that those aged 17 to 29 are the most likely group to carry the infection - although they are far less likely than older people to fall seriously ill.The sampling by Public Health England (PHE), which occurred as the epidemic approached its peak, showed that in early April, around 11 per cent of those aged between 17 and 29 were infected with the virus.Those in their 30s were the age group with the second highest number of infections, at around 10 per cent, with rates closer to seven per cent among those in their 60s.Scientists said the findings reflected the fact young people were the most likely to socialise, and may also have been more likely to flout lockdown advice. The three-week period began on March 23 - the day the lockdown was introduced - meaning many of the findings would reflect social patterns before strict rules came in. Across the capital, levels of infection fell with age, the data suggests. Charts which show prevalence of infection in five age groups from 17-29 up to those aged between 60 and 70, in different regions, over three weeks, show that by and large, levels of infection fell with age. By contrast, the risk of dying from coronavirus rises sharply with age, with 26,800 deaths in those aged 75 and over, compared with around 400 in those aged 44 and under, official statistics show. Professor Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia said: “Young people are the most likely to socialise and the least likely to stick to social distancing guidelines.“So from that viewpoint, it’s not that surprising. In London it shows by April 12 around 11 per cent of 17 to 29 year olds had the infection, compared to seven per cent of those aged 60 to 70 – so a difference of more than half.”Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE\u0027s head of immunisation, said the findings about infection levels were the “exact opposite” to what was being seen in patterns of disease, where older people were far more affected. People who become infected with Covid-19 do not always become ill, with estimates that around one third of those carrying the virus do not show symptoms.Dr Ramsay told a webinar: “We see disease in older adults predominantly, whereas with infection we appear to be seeing it in younger adults.“It’s a very interesting finding and quite possibly unexpected. I think even the modelers found it unexpected that the infection rates appear to be higher in the young adults.“We have limited data from other regions, but the patterns are similar” Health Service Journal reported. The data suggests that over the three weeks ending on April 12, the rate of coronavirus infection rose from 3 per cent to 11 per cent among those aged between 17 and 29 in London.Dr Ramsay said: “We think that probably reflects the incidents just before the lockdown period. “What was fascinating was finding that it suggests transmission in London among young adults was particularly high, even though we were seeing the disease in a very different age group.Since late February, PHE has analysed thousands of blood samples from people across the country as part of a “seroprevalence study” carried out under the fourth pillar of the Government’s testing strategy. Dr Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at PHE, said: “This is ongoing research and needs to be treated with caution, however it is helping us to better understand how the transmission of Covid-19 may be happening and we will be publishing further details in due course.“This is just one element of a range of surveillance systems that PHE has in place to monitor the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/10/22/sunak-budget.jpg","title":"uk investors government debt gilt yields negative","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.As the UK\u0027s Debt Management Office auctions debt with a negative yield for the first time in history, why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money? And what does it mean for the government and for ordinary people?The UK government auctioned a tranche of debt to the financial markets on Wednesday which, for the first time in history, had a negative yield.That means that if the investors were to hold the debt until it matured they would get less back than they paid for it.Government borrowing this year heading to £300bn, says OBRSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut why would investors pay the government for the privilege of lending it money?And why is it happening now?What does it mean for the public finances?And how could it affect the livelihoods of ordinary people?The Debt Management Office, a public body that sells state debt on behalf of the Government, auctioned a parcel of state debt worth £3.75bn to financial investors, a group that generally includes banks, insurance companies, pension managers and hedge funds.The parcel of debt – known as a Gilt-edged security or “Gilt” – is due to mature in July 2023, which is the date that the holders of the Gilt would be repaid their money by the government.The yield on the Gilt is the effective annual interest rate that the investors receive and is determined by the price investors pay to buy the security.The yield on this Gilt, as set by a competitive auction, was -0.003 per cent.Gilt yields have been very low for many years, but this is the first time that the yield on a Gilt has been negative. And the implication is that the investors would ultimately lose money on their investment.Why on earth would investors buy these bonds if it guarantees they will lose money?First it’s important to note that negative yielding government debt has been a feature of several other governments’ bond markets in recent years.Japan and Germany have issued debt at negative yields for some time.Indeed the total value of negative yielding debt around the world at the end of last year was $11 trillion, having peaked at $17 trillion. That’s around a sixth of the total global bond market.Negative yields remain something of a puzzle, but the most common explanation from analysts is that investors, in an era of considerable uncertainty and volatility in markets, are prepared to pay a big premium for the confidence that they will get most of their money back, even if it means a slight loss.Regulation may play a part too, with pension funds, banks and insurance companies effectively compelled since the global financial crisis by regulators to hold more liquid (easily sellable) assets like government bonds as a share of their total assets.

Morgan Asset Management.What does this mean for the Government?In the immediate term it signals strong market demand for Government debt, which is comforting at a time when it is expecting to issue more than £300bn of Gilts in order to pay for its emergency coronavirus spending.Low or negative yields also mean that the Government does not need to worry much about the annual costs of servicing that borrowing.What does it all mean for ordinary people?A government with stable market financing is good news for people receiving state assistance in this crisis because it diminishes the risk these programmes would have to be ended suddenly because the government could not borrow.However, the fact that bond yields are so low probably reflects pessimism from investors about the economy’s medium and long-term economic prospects.If investors thought the economy was going to grow strongly in the years and decades ahead they would be expecting higher inflation in the years ahead and would probably be charging the government more to borrow in the form of higher yields.If investors are right about the bleak overall economic outlook that’s bad news for ordinary workers and households.And low bond yields means the return on many pension saving pots will be lower, meaning people might have to work longer to achieve a financially comfortable retirement.

He told OK! Magazine: “I think it would be pretty cruel to leave us on that cliffhanger. After the response it got at Christmas, you can more or less be certain that, sooner or later, there will be more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLamb, who plays Mick Shipman on the series, added that another one-off episode is more likely than a whole series given the cast’s busy schedules.“The problem is, logistically, it’s a bloody nightmare as so many people involved with it have very active careers. It’s virtually impossible for there to be a whole series, but I imagine there will be another special.Convenience Store Woman is a gothic love story with a capitalist kinkWhat the pandemic reveals about the value of Tom Stoppard’s artCalvin Harris says doctors saved his life after his heart stopped “I’ve always thought a logical thing to do would be a Gavin And Stacey movie, but that’s just my idea.”In April, Ruth Jones dressed up as Nessa to warn fans about the importance of social distancing. “Oh, what’s occurring?” she began. “Not a lot other than a global pandemic, but the question was rhetorical. “Now listen, I am not here to give advice, there’s plenty of others that would do that for you, it’s your life and I am not about to tell you how to live it. I wouldn’t do that to no one. I wouldn’t even tell myself to live my life.”She continues: “If you see me in the morning doing my daily run, my half-marathon around Barry, don’t even think about breaking that two-metre rule, because if you does, I will not hesitate to tell you quite clearly to ‘back off’.”Gavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s an approach Theroux has largely maintained throughout his career his unique brand of bumbling, placid interviewing has won him numerous Baftas and international fame.Some of his films are impossibly moving. Others are so ludicrously funny they’ve spawned countless memes and a Twitter account called No Context Louis Theroux.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo mark Theroux\u0027s 50th birthday, here are seven of his most brilliant documentaries…The Most Hated Family in America (2007)This lid-lifting documentary introduces viewers to the Kansas family at the core of the Westboro Baptist Church, whose members believe the US government is immoral due to its tolerance of homosexuality.Tiger King: Louis Theroux says he ‘liked’ Joe ExoticLouis Theroux launches first podcast series from coronavirus lockdownBBC defends Louis Theroux documentary from damning claimsThe hugely controversial Christian ministry is notorious for picketing at military funerals with homophobic placards, claiming that soldiers were killed because God hates gay people.It’s an extremely uncomfortable watch, like much of Theroux’s best work, and a topic that has been revisited twice by the filmmaker in 2011’s America’s Most Hated Family in Crisis and 2019’s Surviving America’s Most Hated Family.This is one of Theroux’s most heart-rending documentaries, in which he interviews dementia sufferers and their loved ones. In it, we meet a 49-year-old mother who is unable to grasp the seriousness of her own deterioration, and whose husband is anxious about raising their young daughter alone.There are moments of lightness, too, with a mischievous 89-year-old called Nancy teasing and flirting with Theroux in some of her more lucid moments.It doesn’t have the shock factor of some of his most famous films, but it’s a poignant insight into how love can endure such a devastating condition.This film sees Theroux head off to Portland, Oregon, to investigate polyamory. It is 60 minutes of perfect awkwardness.Three groups of people of varying willingness to be in open relationships are interviewed, and at one point Theroux strips off and attends a naked “sensual eating workshop”.Drinking to Oblivion (2016)In this staggeringly moving watch, Theroux embeds himself at King’s College Hospital in south London, where he interviews patients whose alcoholism is so severe that it has put them at death’s door.Joe, who is on his third day of detox, is one of the most memorable addicts featured. When we meet him, he’s spent the last few months drinking a bottle or two of vodka a day and is in withdrawal, petrified and hardly able to stand.From 32-year-old Joe to a woman who’s been on eight cans of cider a day for the past three decades, the subjects are very varied in an astonishing film that gives a face to an addiction suffered by half a million people in England.A Place for Paedophiles (2009)Theroux gains incredible access in this unsettling film shot in California’s Coalinga Mental Hospital. More than 500 convicted paedophiles are housed in the institution, many of whom have already served prison sentences but are deemed too dangerous for release.One of the sex offenders there has undergone castration in an attempt to secure his release, while another confessed to molesting 50 children.At the time, Theroux said Coalinga was “the weirdest place” he had “ever been to”, which, coming from a man who has spent time with Nazis, Scientologists and Tiger King’s Joe Exotic, is quite a statement.Louis and the Nazis (2003)This is one of Theroux’s most famous documentaries. It sees the filmmaker travel to California to spend time with the White Aryan Resistance, a group that includes 11-year-old twin sisters who have been taught to sing racist pop songs by their mother. It’s one of the rare films that shows Theroux almost lose his temper. When he comes face to face with the people who are perpetuating so much hatred, he doesn’t look shy or confused as he often does, instead he is genuinely raging.In this left-field festive special, Theroux brings together four of the characters he met during his Weird Weekends series to pull crackers with him in his Brooklyn apartment. From a man who claims to channel messages from the alien planet Koldas to another who spent 28 years living in a hole in Idaho, it’s an eclectic mix of guests. The show will put any chaotic Christmas dinners you’ve had into perspective.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Inside of it can be seen a spiral structure with a “twist” – which could be the trademark indication of a new world being formed.The research could help us understand how the many thousands of exoplanets that lie scattered through the universe first came about, the scientists say, by allowing them to watch the actual process that gives birth to them.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Thousands of exoplanets have been identified so far, but little is known about how they form,” said Anthony Boccaletti who led the study from the Observatoire de Paris, PSL University, France.While scientists know that planets are born as dusty discs surround young stars, where cold gas and dust are clumped together, the new observations give new information about that process.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien life“We need to observe very young systems to really capture the moment when planets form,” he said.The new images show a hug spiral of dust and gas that has formed around AB Aurigae, a star found 520 lightyears away. Those spirals are an indication that baby planets are being born, since the worlds disturb the gas in ways that can be seen from Earth.As the planet rotates around its star, the wave follows the shape of a spiral arm. It is the “twist” in the new images that indicates one of those disturbances, and therefore an indication that a new planet is being made.“The twist is expected from some theoretical models of planet formation,” said co-author Anne Dutrey, from the Astrophysics Laboratory of Bordeaux.“It corresponds to the connection of two spirals – one winding inwards of the planet’s orbit, the other expanding outwards – which join at the planet location. They allow gas and dust from the disc to accrete onto the forming planet and make it grow.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some countries’ emissions dropped by as much as 26 per cent on average during the peak of the confinement.Visualising the biggest carbon crash ever recordedIf pre-pandemic conditions return by mid-June, then 2020 emissions could decline by a more modest 4 per cent compared to 2019, though this would still be the largest single annual decrease in absolute emissions since the end of World War II.A UN report last year said emissions needed to drop by 2.7 per cent a year keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, and 7.6 per cent a year to keep below 1.5C.“Population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and CO2 emissions,” said lead author Corinne Le Quéré at the University of East Anglia.“These extreme decreases are likely to be temporary, however, as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic, transport, or energy systems,” she added.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailPrevious analysis of data from Carbon Brief and the International Energy Agency revealed the unprecedented scale of the emissions decline.China saw the largest drop in emissions in April, followed by the United States, Europe and India.In the countries with the strictest lockdown restrictions, emissions from aviation plunged 75 per cent in early April, while emissions from land transport fell by 50 per cent and from power generation by 15 per cent.Emissions from industry declined by around 35 per cent, with a lack of data causing some uncertainty. Emissions from residential buildings, however, increased by 5 per cent, the study said.“The emissions reductions occurring because of Covid-19 will clearly be unprecedented. What is less certain is how the economy will rebound in late 2020 and 2021,” said Glen Peters at the CICERO Center for International Climate Research in Norway, which took part in the study.“As different countries and sectors recover, it is unclear if activity levels will return to normal levels or if we may see permanent shifts in behaviour,” he added.The environmental impact of coronavirus containment measures has also led to a huge reduction in air pollution in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions, which are released by cars, aeroplanes and other combustion engines.Satellite images captured by the European Space Agency showed a dramatic decrease in NO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019.Additional reporting by agencies.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That such a galaxy could form so early in the history of the universe indicates that our traditional understanding – where galaxies build up in hierarchies, late in the history of the cosmos – could be wrong.The discovery could help answer the puzzle over one of the most profound questions in cosmology: how the universe changed from its bland, formless state at its very beginning to the complex and structured web of stars and galaxies that surround us today.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as being by far the earliest such disc ever spotted, it is also the most distant ever seen, and it is so far away that scientists are able to see it at a point when the universe was only a tenth of its current age. The object, nicknamed the Wolfe Disc, is spinning at 170 miles per second and has a mass 72 billion times that of our Sun.Our current understanding of galaxies suggests that dark matter “halos” first develop, which then pull in surrounding gas and merge into bigger structures from which stars are formed. As time goes on, that leads to the growth of galaxies.Comet flying towards Earth could be visible with the naked eyeSuch a model suggests that as the gas falls into the disc, it is heated up, leaving a spherical structure that has to cool before it can support the formation of a disc.But the newly discovered galaxy contains a cold, dusty, rotating disc, despite the fact that it formed so early in the universe. That suggests that the gas could have been cool as it fell into the nascent galaxy, allowing for the disc to form quickly.If that is the case, massive gas discs could form 2.5 billion years earlier than scientists had thought, according to the research published by Marcel Neeleman and colleagues in Nature.Such “cold-mode accretion” would change our picture of when and how such disc galaxies – which includes our own Milky Way – are able to form.

Xavier Prochaska, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and coauthor of the paper. “Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.”The finding is based only on one galaxy and so it is difficult to generalise from the findings, notes Alfred Tiley from the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research​, who did not work on the study, in an accompanying article. As such, similar observations of more galaxies are required before scientists can say that the newly discovered disc is representative of a broader trend, he writes.“Nevertheless, Neeleman and colleagues’ findings will excite astronomers, and open up a new epoch of the Universe’s history for the study of early galaxy formation,” Dr Tiley concludes.The research, ‘A cold, massive, rotating disk galaxy 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang’, is published in Nature today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its 48 coaches run a range of sports programmes, including basketball, tennis, table tennis, volleyball and yoga.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLuca Toth, a head coach at the charity, taught volleyball at the Central Foundation Girls’ School in Tower Hamlets. She tells The Independent: “I see sports coaching as a tool to get close to the girls and be a mentor figure. We teach them teamwork, to persevere and to handle disappointment.”Some 67 per cent of the young people Greenhouse mentors live in postcodes classed as “deprived”. Just north of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in Marylebone lies Church Street Ward, one of the most deprived wards nationally. Figures from 2017 suggest more than half of children in the area live in poverty.How to support our campaignA spokesperson for Greenhouse tells The Independent: “Lockdown came in and suddenly kids were completely cut off. One child could have had a breakfast club, a lunch club, a PE session and an afternoon sports session with us. A lot of the kids are going back to home lives that are very difficult, in confined spaces.”Some children that it mentors come from families where sport is not seen as a cultural priority. Others do not speak English at home. “The Joe Wicks PE experience might not actually cut through to them.”Joel Archard, a father of three, calls Greenhouse “a beacon of the community” over the phone with The Independent. His daughter Luna, now 12 years old, plays table tennis with Maria, another coach and mentor. “They didn’t let the lockdown stop them. They do zoom calls, and ask ‘how are you doing?’. It gives the kids a bit of structure to their lives.Greenhouse is also preparing for the end of lockdown. “Everything is pointing to the fact that the recession will hit the kind of families we deal with hardest, especially young people who have missed school,” says a spokesperson.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It now delivers close to 100 food packages a day.Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project and former COO of Greenhouse Sports, says: “The Felix Project is proud to have worked closely with Greenhouse Sports for many years. During this health crisis it’s great to see them open up their amazing sports centre at the heart of the local community. We applaud their innovation.”Help The Hungry campaign to feed vulnerable Londoners raises over £4mVolunteers cook for neighbours struggling without food during crisisMarathons and piggy-back challenges help The Independent raise £3.7mTwo other organisations that have innovated to support our campaign under lockdown are Holland \u0026amp Barrett and Daylesford Organic. Holland \u0026amp Barrett, a regular supplier of The Felix Project, has donated 2,000 units of vitamin D for elderly people stuck at home at risk of deficiency.Daylesford Organic has released a range of fermented vegetables with Felix Project branding. The farm shop offers “ferments” of radish and butternut squash as “unusual” garnishes for meals or cocktails. It expects to raise an additional £10,000 per year, and all profits from the products go to the charity.Luca, the volleyball coach from Greenhouse, expresses her concern about her children’s welfare through this crisis. “There is probably no privacy for many of the kids sharing rooms. I’m worried that the ones who were ok when we left will suffer, and those who weren’t ok at the beginning will come back worse.“We are dealing with so many people who need us. I have seen what a change we have made in these people’s lives.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

The announcement was made less than a day after Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised almost £33 million for the NHS by walking laps of his garden, was given a knighthood. Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, also announced ministers would match the funding raised by the BBC’s BIg Night In to the tune of £70 million. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Queen’s birthday honours list had been due to be published next month. Its contents were agreed before the UK was badly hit by the global pandemic, however. Ministers felt it was more appropriate if the list was delayed to include those who have battled on the frontlines against Covid-19.Mr Dowden also announced that £150 million would be unlocked from dormant bank accounts to help charities respond to the coronavirus crisis. The chancellor has previously announced a  £750 million pot to help charities. Experts warn that charity funding has collapsed, with shops closed and many households tightening their belts. Of the £150 million, £10 million will be for the Youth Futures Foundation to help organisations who support disadvantaged young people into work.Another £45 million will help charities, social enterprises and some small businesses facing cash-flow problems.Mr Dowden said: Charities and social enterprises are playing a vital role in our national effort against coronavirus.This funding will support organisations that are at the heart of their communities, building on our unprecedented package of financial support for the voluntary sector.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The EU wants what it calls a level playing-field clause in the deal, under which the UK would stay in tune with some regulations such as state aid and environmental protections.Former Tory minister calls for ‘phased’ end to free movementUK blames EU’s ‘ideological’ approach for lack of Brexit progressIn a broadside at the approach taken by the UK negotiator, Mr Barnier said: I do not think, however, that an exchange of letters regarding the substance of the negotiations is necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points.He said the EU was sticking to the political declaration that had been signed by Boris Johnson and which spells out the approach both sides would take to their future relationship.In his letter on Tuesday, Mr Frost said Brussels\u0027 proposed deal contains novel and unbalanced proposals which would bind this country to EU law or standards. The UK published its own legal text on Tuesday, which the EU has already been privately privy for a number of weeks.But Mr Barnier said: The UK cannot expect high-quality access to the EU Single Market if it is not prepared to accept guarantees to ensure that competition remains open and fair.

Domino Park, a six-acre park located off the East River in Williamsburg, has been covered with white circles meant to encourage social distancing in the era of Covid-19. A video shared online showed residents lounging in the circles, which are about six feet in diameter and spaced away from other circles to remind residents to not interact with others. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“They’ve made little round human parking spots in Domino Park in Brooklyn,” wrote Jennifer 8. Lee in the caption to her video. Three months ago the idea of positioning oneself in a painted circle to lounge outside would be a bizarre concept. But now most residents have embraced the park’s guidelines and followed social distancing measures by only sitting in the circles when on the turf.“If you were to take video footage from the world today and show it to someone from 2019, they would think it was from some near-future Hollywood dystopian television show instead of real life,” Ms Lee said. Pictures taken on Monday also showed a majority of residents using the circles and wearing masks when at Domino Park. The public park is owned by a private company and not operated by New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other government officials have collaborated with the NYPD to encourage residents to practice coronavirus protective measures when outdoors, such as passing out masks at parks. Signs also popped up at a number of parks and locations around the city to remind people to stay apart from others when out. Last week the mayor said there would be limits to capacity of parks like Domino Park, Sheep Meadow in Central Park, and piers 45 and 46 in Manhattan’s Hudson River Park over the weekend. But it was not clear if or how these capacity limits were enforced. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is intended as an update to a 1 April guidance document issued by Mr Esper.A Pentagon spokesperson said that the new document is outdated. Indeed, since early May it had been circulated among the various branches of the military for feedback, a source told Task \u0026amp Purpose. It is unclear if Mr Esper has yet seen the document.Pentagon sources confirmed to The Hill that there are versions of plans with similar language to the leaked memo, but none have been approved. Senior officials are also discussing plans to continue with the summer 2020 move cycle — also not yet finalised.“All indications suggest we will be operating in a globally-persistent Covid-19 environment in the months ahead,” the memo reads. “This will likely continue until there is wide-scale immunity, through immunisation, and some immunity post-recovery from the virus.”As well as predicting no viable treatment or vaccine until next summer at the earliest, the scenario laid out by the Pentagon assumes successive waves of infection in clusters tied to seasonal flu outbreaks continued shortages of personal protective equipment and testing not being able to completely assure an absence of the virus, and therefore requiring extensive contact tracing and monitoring.As recently as Friday, Mr Esper said that the Pentagon would “deliver by the end of this year a vaccine at scale to treat the American people and our partners abroad.”A spokesperson later clarified that the end of the year was “a goal”, and experts believe that even if everything were to go perfectly, a 12 to 18-month timeline for a widespread rollout of a vaccine would be optimistic.Department of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her opponent, Democratic heavyweight Jerry Nadler, was first elected to Congress in 1992 and has been a fixture of New York politics ever since. But in recent years, progressive candidates have proven adept at challenging the party’s old guard. Insurgent campaigns have won shock victories with strong ground games and community outreach. Ms Boylan’s plan was simple: she was going to outwork her opponent.   Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThen came the coronavirus, and the 36-year-old newcomer was faced with the prospect of an entirely different campaign to the one she had planned for. As it turns out, running for office in the midst of a pandemic is as strange as it sounds. “We\u0027ve shifted in how we connect with people. But I would say if anything, we\u0027re connecting even more because people really do need help now,” she tells The Independent from her home, which is now also her campaign headquarters (her team was looking for office space when Covid-19 arrived). Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?With the New York primary races due to take place next month, Ms Boylan’s own insurgent campaign could answer key questions about the extent to which the political landscape has been affected by the coronavirus. It could also give some clues about what campaigning might look like in November’s presidential election if lockdown measures are still in place. “In terms of the issues that motivate the campaign, it hasn\u0027t changed at all — it has just magnified them,” says Ms Boylan, who has never held elected office before. “If we look at who\u0027s been hit the hardest by this pandemic, physically, mentally and economically, it\u0027s the people who are in the most vulnerable positions in our society and our district. So we have to find ways to change that and help people more.”Ms Boylan, a former state economic development and housing official under governor Andrew Cuomo, concedes that she has had to adapt her strategy on a practical level. For one, she is speaking to The Independent from her daughter’s bedroom, surrounded by dolls. Like lots of parents, she and her husband are now juggling their day jobs with caring for her. “It\u0027s very challenging. But at the same time, there will probably not be another time in our lives where I could be running a congressional campaign and then walk in the other room and see her. So it\u0027s not that I would choose this, this in any way, shape or form, but it\u0027s a real privilege to get to be a mom.”Though she may not be able to press the flesh in the traditional sense, she canvasses by phone — fielding and making dozens of calls a day. She holds community meetings on the video conferencing service Zoom, and weekly meetings on Instagram Live which will often include someone from the community. Predictably, the pandemic is taking centre stage in most of those conversations.  No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I\u0027ve spoken with someone who has been released from the hospital and is now home alone. I\u0027ve talked with people who can’t afford their rent and don’t know what they\u0027re going to do,” she says. In early April, New York became the epicentre of the global coronavirus pandemic. At the height of the outbreak here, the state was recording 1,000 deaths a day and hospitals were overwhelmed. Ms Boylan’s campaign began a year ago with leafleting and face-to-face canvassing, but the lockdown measures put in place to prevent the spread of the virus has changed all that. Her five-person team now mostly works remotely. Her Twitter feed has become a focal point of her output, where she posts videos and jibes directed at Mr Nadler. “I\u0027m actually an introvert, so I have no problem with this forum,” she says of her online campaign. “I got past that idea of having a screen between me and the people pretty early because I realised that the content we would make even before this crisis had a pretty broad reach. And if I\u0027m doing something that makes people feel less alone and makes people feel like they have an advocate in me, then I have no problem with it.” Ground Zero: How New York became the epicentre of coronavirusThe pandemic has already had a significant impact on the nation’s politics. States across the country are rushing to figure out how to conduct an election and campaign while the virus still poses a potent threat. Here in New York, the presidential primary that will be held alongside Ms Boylan’s primary was originally called off, only for a district court judge to reinstate it. Many states have postponed presidential and congressional primary races, and absentee voting has been expanded across the country. Florida went ahead with its election on March 17, only for two poll workers to later ​test positive for the virus. The practical changes that might be needed to address voting in the shadow of the pandemic have been politicised by Donald Trump, who has raged against moves to expand absentee ballots, claiming without evidence that they encourage fraud (research has shown that mail-in voting does not favour one party over the other). On Wednesday he threatened to withhold funding for Michigan and Nevada — both states with Democratic governors — for mailing absentee ballot applications to voters.      Besides the practicalities, there are also questions about how the economic fallout from the coronavirus will change the political debate. Some have speculated that voters may be more willing to accept radical solutions to issues like health care and inequality — that might favour insurgent campaigns.Ms Boylan’s pitch should be familiar to anyone who paid attention to the wave of successful insurgent challengers who ousted establishment Democrats in 2018 primary races. Perhaps the most well-known of them was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (“AOC”), the then 28-year-old activist and former bartender who defeated Representative Joseph Crowley, and Ayanna Pressley, a Boston city council member who beat 10-term incumbent Michael Capuano. “I started out as a real believer in my party, but something has changed in our national discourse. I just don\u0027t think that our party is doing enough to respond to the needs of real people,” says Ms Boylan. “I am absolutely a progressive, and for me that means someone who\u0027s focused on the existential issues of our day, which are extreme inequality and climate change. So where that puts me in line with women like Ayanna Pressley or AOC, I\u0027m all for it.” At the same time, she says she is a little reluctant to accept the comparison, “not because I don\u0027t admire what these women have achieved, but more because when I go to Washington, I know that my biggest job is to represent my community.” Like those campaigns, Ms Boylan has positioned herself as an antidote to the ineffectiveness and complacency of establishment politics, which she argues is personified by Mr Nadler. She has criticised the 72-year-old chairman of the House judiciary committee for being too timid in his pursuit of impeaching Donald Trump — something the congressman’s campaign has touted as his strength. Pandemic or no pandemic, Ms Boylan still faces a huge challenge in defeating Mr Nadler. The longtime congressman, known for his civil liberties activism, has already won a number of high-profile endorsements, among them Elizabeth Warren. “His record shows that he doesn’t just know how to fight, he knows how to win,” she said on Tuesday. Then there is funding. Ms Boylan has raised more than $750,000 so far — an impressive amount for a first-time challenger. According to Politico, much of those contributions came from donors in the financial industry, including many from employees at investment bank Allen \u0026amp Company, where her husband works. She donated around $80,000 of that money herself, and has committed to not taking donations from corporate PACs and the fossil fuel industry. But Mr Nadler’s profile will give him a significant advantage in fundraising. According to the last fundraising report, his campaign has raised more than $1 million. How this advantage will play out in the middle of a pandemic is unclear. Despite the obstacles, Ms Boylan says she just got tired of waiting. “I really got tired of the way that our political system works. Our politics in this city and this state are largely still run by a small group of men. The biggest generational issues we have are very connected to this public health crisis, things like extreme inequality and climate change,” she says.  “I didn’t not see really anyone who represented me doing enough to respond to either of those things. So I decided to do it myself.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Indonesian government has done little to stop the trade of wildlife in the country\u0027s markets.Earlier this month, a coalition of animal rights groups wrote to Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo warning him of the risks posed by the trade of wildlife, as well as dog and cat meat, in the country’s live animal markets.The Dog Meat Free Indonesia coalition wrote: “Despite the worsening situation of the pandemic globally and throughout Indonesia, with all 34 provinces now affected and over 13,000 coronavirus infections and nearly 1,000 deaths nationwide, the sale of wild animals including bats, rats and reptiles alongside dogs and cats and other domesticated animals in markets throughout the country continues unchallenged.“This is in defiance to ever-growing calls from governments, inter-governmental human and animal health experts and key stakeholders from around the world for the immediate closure of live animal markets globally.“It is impossible to ensure that meat sold at these markets is safe for human consumption, and given the unhygienic conditions, it is only a matter of time before the next deadly zoonotic disease emerges.”The Animals Asia Foundation was one of the charities in the coalition who signed the letter. The founder, Dr Jill Robinson MBE, expressed her “100 per cent” support for The Independent’s campaign to ban the wildlife trade.Founder of leading animal charity backs The Independent\u0027s campaignDr Robinson told The Independent that live animal markets are “dirty, dangerous places” that cannot be properly regulated, least of all in countries where “no animal welfare regulations exist, or are poorly enforced if they do”.The trade of wildlife was thrown into the spotlight as the coronavirus is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 27 of the first 41 people who became infected with Covid-19 had been exposed to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, according to a study published in medical journal, The Lancet.Researchers believe the Covid-19 jumped from an animal to a human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Etihad Airways, a state-owned airline under the dominion of Abu Dhabi, the most powerful of seven sheikhdoms that make up the UAE, carried a planeload of goods destined for Palestinians. But shortly after the shipment of 16 tons of coronavirus aid arrived, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei blasted Arab states’ “treachery” against the Palestinian cause in an English-language post on his Twitter page. Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Today, some Persian Gulf states have committed the biggest treachery against their own history and the history of the Arab world,” the account, which is operated by Ayatollah Khamenei’s office, said. “They have betrayed Palestine by supporting Israel. Will the nations of these states tolerate their leaders’ betrayal?”It remained unclear whether Mr Khamenei’s tweet was in response to the aid shipment or what many have described as tentative warming ties between Israel and some Arab countries.  Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?Israeli media reported that the unmarked white plane landed at Tel Aviv’s Ben-Gurion airport late on Tuesday. Photos showed boxes of goods labelled with Palestinian and UAE flags being unloaded from the plane’s cargo bay.The landing marked the first known direct commercial flight between the UAE and Israel, which have no formal ties but are believed to have extensive clandestine dealings, especially to collaborate against Iran. The UAE’s state-run WAM news agency said the shipment was meant to curb the spread of coronavirus in “occupied Palestinian territory.” Neither the West Bank nor the Gaza Strip have an airport, so air shipments to either territory must first go through Israel or neighbouring Jordan or Egypt. Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE’s permanent representative to the UN described the shipment - conducted through the World Food Programme - as a purely humanitarian gesture. “This international crisis necessitates an international response,” she was quoted as saying by UAE media. The airline also downplayed the flight, describing it to news agencies as a shipment of medical supplies with “no passengers on board.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Most Arab states are currently keeping a distance from Israel because of its controversial plans to annex parts of the West Bank. “For the first time, an Etihad cargo plane just landed at Israel’s Ben-Gurion airport,” Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the UN, wrote on Twitter. “Hopefully soon, we will see passenger flights, too.”Rabbi Marc Schneier, who is a special advisor to King Hamad of Bahrain, told The Independent it was a significant “step towards normalisation” between the states.Last June, the prominent New York Rabbi attended the launch in Bahrain of the economic segment of Donald Trump’s peace plan to end the decades-old Israeli and Palestinian conflict.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People wait in line to undergo the coronavirus tests while keeping distance from each other at a makeshift clinic set up on a playground in Incheon, South KoreaFirefighters fighting a fire at a plastics factory in front of a huge cloud of smoke in Ladenburg, GermanyUgandan academic Stella Nyanzi reacts as police officers detain her for protesting against the way that government distributes the relief food and lockdown situation in KampalaA woman sits alone on a bench in a park following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Dublin, IrelandCrematory workers using protective gear are pictured at a crematory in Nezahualcoyotl during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), on the outskirts of Mexico City, MexicoHealthcare workers, nurses and doctors, unified under the movement called Take Care of Care wearing face masks protest against the Belgian authorities\u0027 management of the coronavirus crisis, at the MontLegia CHC HospitalA girl watches over goats on the banks of the Dal Lake during rainfall in SrinagarLife-size cardboard figures with photos of football fans are positioned on the stands of Borussia Moenchengladbach\u0027s football stadium for their next game, which will be played without spectators, due to the coronavirus outbreak in GermanyNurses wearing face masks take part in an event held to mark International Nurses Day, at Wuhan Tongji Hospital in ChinaIraqi protesters gather on the Al-Jumhuriyah bridge in the capital Baghdad during an anti-government demonstration.

The journey has begun, this is one more benchmark along that journey.”Israel and Palestine have reported nearly 17,000 coronavirus infections and at least 270 deaths.

The local administration in the Chinese city said on Wednesday that along with the consumption ban, Wuhan would become a “wildlife sanctuary” where virtually all hunting of wild animals was banned with the exception of measures for ”scientific research, population regulation, monitoring of epidemic diseases and other special circumstances”. As part of the ban, the city introduced stringent controls on the breeding of all wild animals, prohibiting any to be reared for food, CBS reported. Wuhan will also join a wider scheme across the country to offer buyouts to farmers who breed wild animals.​Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFounder of leading animal charity backs The Independent’s campaignWoman jailed for illegal trade in wildlife has sentence doubledArmy of volunteers ‘could be used to fight off invasive species’Coronavirus fears as China plans to entrench mink and fox fur industryWuhan, a city of 11m people in the Hubei province of China, saw the first cases of Covid-19 late last year. The origins of the pandemic are still being investigated but one of the suspected sources is the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city which included a live animal section reportedly selling more than 30 species of animals including live wolf pups, golden cicadas, scorpions and civets. China closed the market in January.On the whole, researchers agree that the most plausible explanation is that the virus made the jump from an animal to human in a “zoonotic spillover” event.China has been under pressure from the global community to tackle its illegal wildlife trade after it was linked to the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Coronavirus: China’s farmers offered buy-out to end wildlife breedingThe global death toll is now 318,789 people from the coronavirus, the World Health Organisation reported today. More than 4.7m people have been infected worldwide. Last week, two central provinces in China announced plans for a government buy-out for wildlife farmers to help transition those whose livelihoods depend on breeding wild species for consumption away from the practice.The plans would give wildlife farmers in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, two neighbouring regions, the opportunity to be compensated for switching to grow fruit, vegetables, tea plants, or herbs for traditional Chinese medicine. There is also an option to breed other animals such as pigs and chickens.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Each wild goose or Chinese muntjac deer will be worth 2,457 yuan ($345) each.In February, China issued an unprecedented nationwide ban on all terrestrial wild animal commerce and consumption, including exotic species raised on farms.The initial buy-out covers 14 species of farmed wildlife and only farms operating legally with breeding permits before the February ban are eligible for the programme.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Especially my track, Alive.”The music didn’t disappoint, either, ranging all the way from the excellent Icelandic entry, Think Of Things, to knock-kneed techno from some Russian live-wires called Little Big.My personal highlight, though, was the nutty Latvian bird, Samanta Tina, who turned up for her promotional video wearing a PPE mask and squirting a bottle of disinfectant everywhere.If ever it got a bit too “Eurovision”, though, there was a special guest on hand to calm the mood down.Sweden’s Mans Zelmerlow sang Heroes in his back garden , Italy’s Diodato slowly murdered Volare in a CGI amphitheatre and Ireland’s Johnny Logan had either aged quite dramatically or had to be replaced, right at the last second, by Julian Assange on the poignant What’s Another Year.The one constant, though, was Norton, who handled Eurovision’s new socially-distanced, time-delayed, non-competitive format as brilliantly as he did the old one and was in no mood to spare feelings.“Samanta Tina. She’s tried to represent Latvia six times, Lithuania twice and now she’s got through it’s been cancelled. You’d think she’d take the hint, wouldn’t you.”“Serbia’s answer to The Pussycat Dolls, when the question is — name a group that isn’t as good as The Pussycat Dolls ”It was a joy to watch after seeing so many hosts and shows fail spectacularly with “the new normal” and my only real complaint was that there wasn’t enough of him or the event.I wanted a vote as well, of course. But by the time I was ready for Norton to annihilate the regional juries, it was all over.Lesson learned, though. If I ever take this event for granted or complain about the running time again, you have permission to shoot me down in righteous flames.Meantime, stay hellzy.The Real Marigold Hotel, Britt Ekland: “I look in the mirror — it’s OK.

a maelstrom of confusion over what to do about the family holiday they booked when coronavirus was still but a glint in China’s eye.You can go to France but will have to quarantine for two weeks when

This is about ‘safe’ being an acceptable level of risk.”Dame Angela McLean, the deputy chief scientic adviser, said an effective track and trace system was needed to isolate those infected by the coronavirus before changes were made to lockdown rules.She told The Times that this should be based on observed levels of infection . . . and not on a fixed date.And scientist John Edmunds, another member of SAGE, told Sky News that a track and trace system must be embedded and working well before schools re-opened.Teaching unions are opposed to the Governments plan to re-open schools on June , claiming teachers, pupils and their families will be at risk of catching the deadly virus.They were backed last week by the British Medical Association, who said unions were absolutely right to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on June .BMA councils chair, Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA councils chair, said at the time: We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK.Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union , refused to back down on Tuesday, saying: “Our current assessment is that schools aren’t safe to open, as our five tests have not been met.Butour five tests are met, then on a national level, it would be permissible to go ahead with reopening schools.”According to the Daily Mail, its leaders were caught making a series of slurs in a Zoom meeting last night.The video footage exposed the joint general secretary Mary Bousted accusing children of being mucky by spreading germs and wiping their snot on peoples clothes.The hard-line leaders also discussed how to threaten head teachers should they try to get their staff back to work.The NEU’s five tests include lowering the number of virus cases, plans for social distancing, more testing, strategies for entire schools and protection for the vulnerable.The reopening of primary schools could be delayed beyond June  as local authorities yesterday advised their schools to stay closed, including the first Tory-run council.The Government made clear today that every school’s circumstances were dferent and thata head teacher felt unable to open next month, they should “discuss options” with their local authority or trust.It comes as France makes a mockery of British demands, with teachers ing to French schools wearing masks and taking simple extra precautions.They are among  European to countries which have re-opened classrooms - and evidence suggests that doing so has not been harmful to kids or teachers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the over s have seen this figure almost double.Previously, they spent just  minutes a day worrying, but this has now risen to an hour and seven minutes.Fty-somethings have also gone from feeling anxious for  minutes a day to more than an hour-and-a-half now.It also emerged one in five adults – including  per cent of those over  – believe they are experiencing anxiety for the first time ever as they adjust to a new normal.Worryingly, more than two thirds who are experiencing anxiety said this was manesting itself in physical symptoms.Dr Meg Arroll, a chartered psychologist working with Healthspan, said: “For a long time, young people have been thought to be most likely to suffer from an increase in stress and anxiety as they find their way in the world, or juggle young families and work.“But while they are still spending a large part of their day feeling anxious, those over  have seen the biggest jump in the time they spend suffering from stress and anxiety in recent weeks.“There is a real worry about people’s mental health as they adapt to a new normal – particularly for older people who may see more changes than most in the way they live their lives in the coming months, leading to feelings of isolation, vulnerability and helplessness.”The study also found  per cent of adults admitted they have times where they feel constantly worried or anxious.Financial worries are the biggest cause of stress, followed by health issues, a lack of sleep and weight gain.A loved one’s health issues and safety, work and the economy are also among the most common concerns.Three quarters of those polled have even lost sleep due to their anxiety – an average of four hours a week.Others have experienced physical symptoms as a result of their stress, including headaches or migraines , stomach discomfortand palpitations .A loss of appetite , a dwindling libidoand even dizzinessare also among the symptoms suffered when feeling stressed or anxious.Sufferers have also made a mistake at work , cancelled a night outor rowed with a friend or family member .But almost four in  admitted to turning to food and comfort eating when they feel under pressure.And more than one in  have called in sick to work,  per cent have argued with a partner and one in twenty have even seen it end a relationship.Dr Sarah Brewer, author ‘CBD: The Essential Guide to Health and Wellness’, said: “Many people are trying to find natural ways to relieve stress with products like CBDworking really well to help reduce anxiety.With people struggling to sleep we are also seeing a growth in self-care products such as Healthspan’s Magnesium Bath Flakes and sleep aids such as Valerian and HTP.”It also emerged half of those polled, via OnePoll, feel they are more prone to anxiety as they get older.And unsurprisingly,  per cent are feeling more stressed about their health at the moment.Coronavirus is the top health concern currently for  per cent, along with mental health , weightand fitness levels .More than half are also feeling anxious about things ‘ing to normal’ after the lockdown.Dr Meg Arroll added: “It’s no surprise that the top three reasons for heightened levels of stress cited in this survey are financial concerns, health anxieties and a preoccupation with not getting enough sleep as these worries are often intertwined.“Therefore, breaking these negative thought cycles is important not only for mental health, but for overall physical health and ing also.“With so much going on at the moment, it can feel like all we do is worry.This type of negative identity can be damaging over time as we ignore the other positive coping traits we have.To combat this there are exercises here that can help to build a more positive self-identity, which in turn will help you turn the volume down on anxiety.This is a great way to also engage in some self-kindness during Mental health Awareness Week.”A massive list can feel overwhelming, so we often do the jobs that aren’t really all that important simply to tick something off the list.While this can feel nice for a fleeting moment, it can increase stress levels as the tasks we have to get done are still there, usually when we’re feeling drained and tired at the end of the day.So split your list – first write down all of your to-dos, then rank these in terms of priorities and finally give yourself a slimmed down version of ‘must-dos’ for each day and deal with this first.As this year’s theme during Mental Health Awareness Week is kindness, make sure one of these must-dos is a self-care to show yourself some much-needed thoughtfulness in trying times.When we’re stressed, indecisiveness creeps in and we can turn into deer in headlights.On a piece of card or paper, draw a large outer circle and smaller inner circle. Divide the outer circle into four quadrants.Then, in the small circle write “I will…”, while in the quadrants add “Tackle this right away”. “Just breathe deeply”, “Let it go forever” and “Put this aside for now”.Next time you’re struggling to make a decision, pop a pencil in the middle and spin.Whichever space the pen tip lands on is how you’re going to deal with the issue or stressor.Andthe Wheel’s decision feels uncomfortable, this exercise enables you to quickly find an alternate decision that you can commit to.Dr Meg Arrolls psychological tips for tackling anxietyTo tackle stress and anxiety it can be helpful to distinguish between the two – stress is a response to a known ‘stressor’, right now that may be trying to manage working from home when the kids are also in the house, whereas anxiety is more about ruminating over the past or worrying about the future, for instance long-term financial security.This distinction can help to figure out our circle of influence, i.e. what we can control in le, as generally we have more practical control over stressors than anxiety triggers but for anxiety, it’s more helpful to focus on our inner narrative to reduce the unpleasant consequences of negative thought patterns.Take - small pieces of paper and write down one of your positive characteristics such as “I’m strong”, “I’m compassionate”, etc. on each.Fold all these bits of paper and pop them into the jar, then next time you start to feel like all you do is worry, pull out a trait.Remind yourself of specic times you were strong or compassionate, for example, and how you can use this characteristic again in the future.Research shows that writing down our fears helps us to process them, but it’s important also to remind ourselves that we will be okay.So, in one column write down your three main concernsand then in a column to the right, put the heading ‘ways this will be alright’.It can be hard to find that comforting voice inside soyou’re struggling, think of the personwho makes you feel safe and think about what they would say and write this down.Over time, your mind will automatically seek-out the internal reassurance and these anxieties will lose their power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but this could be later depending on the reduction in numbers of Covid- infections.Studios will also have to pass several tests before opening their doors again to prove they can ensure the safety of gym-goers amid the pandemic.Currently, people are permitted to exercise outside as many times each day as they wish since coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors.Here, we’ve rounded up what changes could be in place when you finally get to sweat it out in your local gym again...Gyms could follow in the footsteps of ious restaurants and airports across the world and introduce temperature checks.This would involve having a thermometer aimed at your forehead every time you go to the gym to identyyoure sick.If a person has a fever and therefore might be infected with coronavirus, they would then be turned away and urged to seek medical care.Hong Kong gym-goer Virginia Lau revealed on Twitter that she had to give a health declaration on arrival at her gym amid the coronavirus pandemic.This would confirm that youre fit and well and do not have coronavirus.Most gyms and fitness centres have their treadmills and machines packed together pretty tightly, so these could be separated by glass partitions.These iders will help to stop the spread of the virus when two-metre distance, in line with the UK Governments advice, cannot be easily maintained.This has been seen in Hong Kong, China - where gyms are slowly starting to reopen.In a bid to ensure gym-goers are able to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule, do not use signs could be placed on every other machine.Showers and chairs in reception may also be sealed off with signs.While coronavirus isn’t a waterborne virus, gyms may close existing fountains as a precautionary measure.This would minimise any risk, however small, of cross-contamination.Gym-goers will also have to make sure they dont share their reusable bottle with anyone  and clean water bottles between each gym session.Businesses that have been allowed to stay open during lockdown have introduced hand sanitiser stations to help keep customers safe.It could be possible that youll see similar hand sanitiser and phone wipe stations appear at the entrance of gyms as well as next to dferent gym equipment.If you use an alcohol-based hand gel, you need to ensure you use it for  to  seconds, according to the World Health Organisation .Gyms should provide cleaning towels so their clients can wipe down equipment after use.These are likely to be accompanied by sprays, wipes and disinfectant that protect against viruses like Covid-.Like other reopened businesses, you could find social distance signs and markers in your local gym or fitness studio.Gym-goers will have to ensure they keep the two-metre social distancing rule at all times and avoid using equipment directly next to wear someone  is working out.If gyms follow in the footsteps of other establishments that have already reopened doors, youll see your PT and other gym staff wearing a face mask.Staff may also be made to wear gloves when cleaning equipment and checking in members at the front desk.Gyms are likely to increase hygiene measures when they do reopen to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.This would mean all gym equipment and weights being wiped down more often - especially for high use areas such as pin pads, door handles, lockers and equipment.Gym-goers will also have to wipe down the machines theyve been on after use with disinfectant.If gyms follow other establishments, it could mean youll see one-way systems in place when you next visit your fitness studio.This could include doors being used for entrances and exits only.Gyms will likely have to limit the number of people allowed inside at one time.This could mean you may face queuing to get inside.Chatty Dobson, owner of fitness studio FLEX Cha, told The Sun: We will need to reduce class sizes to maintain social distancing, and will be enforcing staggered class check-in time so as not to have a build-up of clients in reception or outside studios before classes.Our bathrooms will be open, but we’re waiting for updates as to whether or not it will be possible for clients to use the showers.As well as the above measures, gyms may also try to focus on outdoor bootcamps, given transmission of the virus is lower outdoors.Chatty added: At the moment everything is very up in the air – we have no indication of how much of our attention should be directed to our reopening.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead, teaching could take place in the sports hall, in the theatre and in the concert hall.All independent schools offer financial help to families, and while it is usually offered when a child enters school, it can be extended to families whose circumstances change.Most private schools have funds available for this situation, and can defer feesthere is a prospect of employment in the future.This is usually up to twelve months, and schools rarely charge interest.Neil Roskilly, chief executive of the Independent Schools Association, said that parents facing financial dficulties should contact their school as soon as possible.Yes, private schools are furloughing staff under the taxpayer funded Covid- scheme.Roskilly also said that many schools were expecting a tough time, as parents hit by the economic impact of coronavirus pull their children out.He said: “There’s this image of private schools being these very well-funded organisations like Eton and Harrow, but the vast majority are nothing like that.They are having to look hard at their teaching staff and think about such things as furloughing.”To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I couldn’t type, because my hands shook so much.”Schultz, who was hospitalized on March , had traveled to Boston to visit his boyfriend, Josh Hebblethwaite, , on March .A week before, they had been to a festival in Miami Beach where at least  people later contracted COVID- and three men died.But Schultz said there were no real restrictions in place, though. No lockdowns.Days after arriving in Boston, he began feeling ill and was soon rushed to hospital with a -degree fever and his lungs full of liquid.He was given oxygen and sedated before being transferred to another hospital where he was intubated for over four weeks.“There was no one  around, and I would be the one to make decisions for him,” Hebblethwaite said. “It was definitely scary.”“About four weeks in, the nurses were nice enough to FaceTime with him.It was pretty much like he was in a coma. It was definitely scary. But I was so happy to see him at that point.”The couple say theyve received a lot of abuse for attending the Florida festival, with some people saying Schultz deserved to get sick.But he said the positive feedback has outweighed the negative comments.After being released from hospital, he enjoyed the two double cheeseburgers, small fries and a strawberry shake he ordered at McDonald’s, although he said his taste was somewhat affected.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

like frogs-  for eating and bans on wildle trading in markets and online.This notice shall come into force on the date of promulgation and shall be valid for five years, the the statement read.Wuhan is now the fourth Chinese city to outlaw dangerous practice of selling wild animals for food.The World Health Organisation has previously pointed the finger at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in the city for the killer outbreak.It claimed many of the first virus victims were stall owners, employees or regular shoppers.The WHO said tests on samples indicated it was the source of the outbreak or had “played a role in the initial amplication”.The Huanan market had a wild animal section where live and slaughtered species were sold for food including snakes, frogs, beavers, porcupines and even baby crocodiles.Close interactions with wild animals have caused numerous disease outbreaks in humans including Ebola, Sars and HIV.Viruses can sp easilyanimals in markets are sick or kept in dirty, cramped conditions, such as in stacked cages.When animals are under duress, viral pathogens can intermingle, swap bits of their genetic code, and possibly mutate in ways that make them more transmissible between species.In the case of respiratory diseases -  like Covid- - the virus can jump to food handlers or shoppers through exposure to an animal’s bodily fluids.Early studies showed the new strain of coronavirus did originate in bats, but scientists have been trying to find which animal then transferred it onto humans.Dferent studies have so-far linked pangolins, stray dogs and snakes to the cause of the deadly outbreak which has so far claimed more than , lives.The search for the source of the virus has become more complex since US-China relations have soured following President Trumps claim it originated in a lab.Mr Trump has repeatedly told the media he has evidence  the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.But China has responded to these allegations with its own conspiracy theory asserting that American soldiers may have been responsible for the outbreak.News of the ban comes as it is revealed more than , people in Wuhan may have been infected by Covid-.The shock figure comes after an antibody sampling showed a positive rate of five to six per cent in the city.With a population of  million in Wuhan, the findings suggest that up half a million people in the city could have already been struck down.Meanwhile the under-fire city has already screened more than half of its population -

Englandaposs primaries were told to prepare to bring back year R,  and  pupils back to class, with other primary years ing later in June.  But those plans were hurled into doubt by a mass revolt from unions and councils. Liverpool, Hartlepool, Birmingham, and even Tory-run Solihull and Essex have warned June  might not be possible. Some are looking at later dates, some are still waiting to see what will happen, and some are suggesting s may be part-time - despite the government saying this isnapost an option.Schools are of course already open for vulnerable children and those of key workers. But plans to open them more widely - which involves halving class sizes, hiding away toys, having staggered breaks and making corridors one-way - have ided many in the teaching profession. They need time to prepare, and also want to see the full scientic evidence on whether itaposll be safe. Scientists have also said the government should wait until after a delayed test, track and trace app is up and running. AskedLabour would back councils refusing to open on June , a spokesman for Keir Starmer said: “Ultimately councils will want to do what is in the best interests of children and families in their respective area. The infection rate ies from area to area so it’s not surprising some councils have particular concerns.” The government has insisted the June  date was at the earliest and schools wouldnapost be reopenedit was unsafe. Today one minister, Robert Buckland, admitted they may not open unormly across England. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland they will remain shut to the wider population.

Simply forcing schools to reopen without taking steps to reduce the risk of the virus spread is unacceptable… We can’t put people at risk by rushing back to normality before it’s safe.” Birmingham We only support Birmingham schools opening to more pupils when it is safe to do so. We are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on  June.  Bradford Bradford Council has no intention of directing schools to open on June  or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open. Parents will not be finedthey choose not to send their children back to school at this time. Brighton and Hove We have strongly advised our schools that they should only reopen to more children when their risk assessments indicate it is safe to do so. It is likely that wider re-opening will happen at dferent times for dferent schools and for dferent numbers of children, given each school’s particular circumstances. Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees: You cannot just make a blanket statement on Bristol. What we’ve said is we will back our schools to make the decision they have to make. Bury While high levels of Covid- infection in the north west remain, and guidance around practical arrangements for social distancing within educational environments, testing and tracing, and supply of PPE is unclear, the borough will not be re-opening schools on June .  Calderdale Adam Wilkinson, lead member for children and young people: We are advising schools in Calderdale not to extend opening on  June. We are keen to get more pupils back to school, but safety is of paramount importance  we have been advised by public health professionals that governments key tests have not been met. Durham Schools in County Durham are being advised that they should only start a phased reopening when they feel it is safe to do so.  Essex Whilst all schools are working hard to respond to the guidance provided by the Department for Education, depending on each inidual school context, some primary, infant and junior schools may not be able to offer full-time provision for the relevant year groups, and any new arrangements may not be introduced exactly from the st June. Gateshead We have absolute confidence that each school will determine the risk, and will make the right decision for their schools, pupils, staff and parents. The council will fully support any school that after careful consideration of all these factors, determines that they cannot comply with government instruction. Hartlepool We have agreed [schools] will not reopen on Monday  June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.

British Airline Pilotsapos Association general secretary Brian Strutton told MPs carriers were “egging the pudding too much to take advantage of the crisis”. British Airways came under heavy attack during a two-hour session of the cross-party Commons Transport Select Committee. There were also hints passengers could boycott the carrierpotential fliers were unhappy with BAaposs actions. BA is among several airlines planning redundancies as the aviation industry battles the Covid- crisis. Planes across the globe were effectively grounded as lockdown and travel restrictions were imposed. Ryanair plans , jobs losses and to cut staff pay by up to a fth.  Virgin Atlantic plans to cut more than , jobs and shut its operations at Gatwick Airport. BA has announced plans to axe , posts – more than a quarter of its workforce – and senior BA cabin crew face a % pay cut under a proposed new contract. IAG, which owns British Airways, claims it does not expect demand for air travel to recover before , while Gatwick Airport has said it could take up to four years. But Mr Strutton told MPs: I believe that airlines are exaggerating the problem. The predictions that some of the airline leaders are saying, of up to a five or six-year recovery, is not in line with industry standard predictions.  Last week, the International Air Transport Association – which is usually the touchstone for these things – issued its new projections and said that by the end of  we would be back to  levels. Weaposre in a trough at the moment, we will be coming out of it over the next two-and-a-half years, and I think that airlines are egging the pudding too much to take advantage of the crisis to make changes and downsize their workforce unnecessarily. Unite union assistant general secretary Diana Holland told the committee she was extremely concerned about the industryaposs future. She said: If there isnapost revenue coming in to the industry itaposs not just the airlines , itaposs the airports, itaposs everything down the line and of course all the people that work there. We are extremely worried about the future, and thataposs why we need to come together now to look at what plan we have to restart, to rebuild confidence and to make sure that jobs, pay terms and conditions – while there maybe temporary changes as we reach that point – arenapost decimated for the future.” Ms Holland admitted there may be temporary changes to jobs, pay, terms and conditions, but stressed they must not be decimated for the future. Conservative MP Chris Loder said Government support to BA was being used “as a buffer in order to allow them to progress considerable numbers of redundancies”. Labouraposs Sam Tarry said: “We see a parent company that has assets in the region of £billion, we see a company that has thousands of staff on furlough.” He accused the firm of using the crisis to “restructure the company”. Mr Tarry urged the Government to tell BA to “hand back the British flag because they donapost seem able to be supporting British jobs, able to represent our country globally”.  Committee chairman Huw Merriman accused BA of an “opportunist an underhand approach to their workforce”. Aviation Minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs Iaposve spoken with representatives at BA and obviously Iaposve expressed my disappointment. She added: I think the British public will make their own views on the actions of certain airlines. Ms Tolhurst admitted “any announcement around job losses or consultation round redundancies or terms and conditions is deeply worrying”. She insisted the threat of job losses keeps me awake at night. I am under no illusions to the impact and the concern that those iniduals will be feeling at that time, and what the consequences could be for some of them,” she said.

Broadcasters have previously been banned from screening matches kicking off at pm on Saturdays amid fears fans would opt to stay in and watch TV rather than attend a game.But with matches due to take place behind closed doors when the season resumes amid the coronavirus pandemic, there is no longer a reason for the protection.Speaking at the No press conference, Mr Dowden said: I think that creates an opportunity for us to be able to get some sport, some Premier League, free-to-air.” He added: Those discussions are ongoing. Mr Dowden also offered fresh hopes holidaymakers might be able to take UK staycations from July. Insisting he “would love to get the tourism sector up as quickly as we possibly can”, he admitted: Clearly, we can only do ititaposs safe to do so because I think the worse thing for our tourism sector would be to start, then see the R rate rise out of control, see a second peak that overwhelms the NHS that we then have to slam on the brakes again.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk jobless table one hard","story":"NewsUKs worst-hit places for unemployment during coronavirus pandemic - see listThe number of people out of work and claiming benefits in the UK is skyrocketing as Brits are warned a recession is on its way and more pain yet to comeShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video no-quick-economic-bounce-back-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics uk-jobless-table-one-hard-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Areas which were already among the worst off suffered most, the Institute for Employment Studies said. Torsten Bell, chief executive of living standards think-tank the Resolution Foundation said it showed “Britain’s jobs crisis has now arrived”. Calling for more support for young people he urged the Government to “repair our social security safety net” to protect those facing financial ruin. But Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Reynolds warned: “Unfortunately, these claimants will now discover the UK has one of the weakest out-of-work safety nets in the developed world.” It came as the number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus rose by  to , and figures suggested around , elderly care home residents have died. Gordon Brown lashed out at an apparent lack of leadership, with Boris Johnson “hiding” from the public recently. Mr Johnson, seen ing from a run yesterday, has led the daily Downing Street briefing just twice since going back to work on April . He has given one Commons statement on the pandemic since it began. While Mr Brown said he would “take into account” the fact Mr Johnson had been ill, he insisted he needed to tell Parliament his strategy for protecting lives and jobs. Mr Brown said: “He has got to get a grip on the testing and he has got to get a grip on what is going to happen to the economy as it moves forward.” The Government is also facing growing pressure from councils and teaching unions to reconsider plans to open primary schools in England. Experts have predicted the unemployment rate could eventually hit %, up from .%. And Mr Sunak told the House of Lords Treasury Committee via video­link “the jury is out” on what the economy will look like after the crisis.  “I certainly won’t be able to protect every job and every business,” he said. “We’re seeing [it] in the data and no doubt there will be more hardship to come. We are likely to face a severe recession the likes of which we have not seen.” The Institute for Employment Studies said many of the areas worst hit by the rise in unemployment were in the North West of England. In Blackpool, % are now “claimant unemployed”, up from % in March. Elsewhere, one in  residents are claimant unemployed in Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Thanet, Kent. In another sign of the bleak employment landscape, there was a record fall in job vacancies, down , to , in the three months to April. There are also fears over the effect that increased unemployment will have on the nation’s health.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said a % rise could lead to a further one million people developing chronic health conditions. Unemployment was already on the rise, climbing by ,, to . mil­­lion in the three months to March. The number of paid employees plunged by , at the start of April to . million but this excluded eight million currently furloughed. Calling for more support for young people Mr Bell also warned against a sharp clf-edge end to furlough.

Little Maisie fell over while her grandfather was mowing the familyaposs lawn and blades severed off her big toe on her right foot and entire left foot last week.

Emma had warned Maisie to stop but she excitedly chased after the sit-on lawnmower when she fell and, unbeknownst to her devastated grandfather, fell under the sharp blades. The mum-of-three feared that Maisie would bleed to death as she desperately stemmed the blood flow until paramedics rushed the little girl to hospital. Surgeons at Addenbrookeaposs Hospital, Cambridge, spent  hours cleaning the wound and reattaching the flesh - and even after two more operations Maisie may still face her foot having to be amputated. Devastated mum Emma, , is now speaking out about the accident to warn others to keep their children inside when mowing the lawn and is crowdfunding to provide for Maisieaposs recovery. for a daily email to help you get through family le in lockdown at  mirror lemonaidEmma, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said: Itaposs heartbreaking.

Despite doctors hoping Maisieaposs foot has been saved and re-attached, her right toe was unable to be reattached and she faces an indeterminate amount of time in hospital. With just one parent allowed to visit Maisie at a time due to coronavirus restrictions, Emma and dad Chris, , are taking it in turns to be by her bedside. The couple anticipate that their daughter will need to leave hospital in a wheelchair and will need physiotherapy and counselling to recover - with the possibility of prosthetics not ruled out. The couple are fundraising to pay for Maisieaposs future treatment and have raised more than £, so far.

Haven, Center Parcs and Butlin’s are drawing up plans to adapt their sites to cater for families’ “pent-up demand to get away” while sticking to vital social distancing rules.They are hoping the Government clears holiday parks and resorts to reopen in July – under what would be Phase Three of Boris Johnson ’s plan to ease us out of lockdown and reboot the hospitality sector.It comes after Visit Britain said the domestic market, worth £billion, has already lost £billion as a result of Covid- measures. The group wants families to make  the “year of domestic tourism”. Acting chief executive Patricia Yates told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee: “To get British tourism up and running this summer – and the summer is hugely important – you’re going to need that domestic audience.” She added there was “a real job to be done” to convince people it is acceptable to “enjoy a holiday and that it’s safe to do so”. But figures from coolcamping. com, covering  locations, show summer bookings for campsites have soared % in the past week. The website said: “There’s clearly a pent-up demand to get away. The mooted date of July  is ideal timing for summer and could save many businesses who have had no income.” Rethinks on how resorts and parks operate will help reassure people mulling a staycation. Haven says planned measures range from Perspex screens at reception and info desks to check-ins from home. On-site grocery stores will have the same social distancing rules as supermarkets, while restaurants will just do takeaways and deliveries. Hand- washing stations will be dotted around all  parks and there will be reduced numbers on sites – with communal areas like swimming pools will staying closed.Haven said: “Our prices have been adjusted to recognise the revised experience. We’ve made signicant changes, which we anticipate will allow us to open as soon as Government deems it safe. We’ll comply with coronavirus restrictions.”Center Parcs, which has six UK sites, is also hoping to reopen in July and said holidaymakers could expect to see “some changes”. A spokesman said: “We are reviewing the whole experience to ensure we can open with appropriate social distancing as well as any other measures required to keep our staff and guests safe. “We know we can adapt and provide reassurance to guests and staff, and will only reopen when the time is right. When we do, we are confident we will provide a great guest experience for families.” Butlin’s said fewer people would be allowed in entertainment venues and it would increase the number of shows. There will be more sittings for meals as well as extra events so that kids do not miss out on activities. The firm said: “We are awaiting guidance as to when we can reopen. “In the meantime, we’re using all of the skills and creativity of our team to plan a break that keeps everyone safe.” The Camping and Caravanning Club, which represents , sites, said caravanners will park six metres apart and tents will also be pitched with large gaps between them. Its plans include asking campers and caravan owners to bring their own portable loos so toilets can stay closed. Bosses offered to do a trial reopening after losing £million of bookings due to Covid-. Camping and Caravanning Club director general Sabina Voysey said: “We’re well-placed to offer socially-distanced holidays and eager to work on trial schemes for how campsites may reopen with all necessary measures. “We urge the Government to provide greater clarity on how the sector can safely open and operate.” The plans to get staycations firmly on the radar emerged as airlines slammed a bid by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to boost uptake of foreign holidays as unworkable. Mr Shapps raised hopes of travel to top hotspots by striking up no-quarantine deals, or “air bridges”, with countries where infection rates are low. Britain’s biggest tour operator, Tui, said it hopes to kick-start the season from June . The firm got a boost after Portugal and Greece revealed they were willing to relax quarantine restrictions for Britsit was a two-way system. Algarve Tourism Board head Joao Fernandes said: “If British holidaymakers are allowed to fly to countries with low infection rates via ‘air bridges’, without having the need for quarantine, the Algarve will be the place to be.” But airlines said the scheme was at odds with the Government’s two- week quarantine rules for anyone coming into the UK, effective from next month, and a Foreign Office ban on non-essential travel abroad. The PM’s official spokesman said air bridges were “an option under consideration but not agreed policy”.

Troy House in Monmouth originates from the th century and the Grade II listed four storey dream home comes complete with a theatre, chapel and two tennis courts. It was built for the family of the Duke of Beaufort, adding to an imposing portfolio of properties which also included Great Castle House in Monmouth and Badminton House in Gloucestershire. The estate was later converted into a convent school and then became a school, but as the condition of the buildings deteriorated the school moved locations in the s and the once grand manor has been left to rot.The , square-foot property has now been put up for auction, with a guide price of between £, and £, - but a look inside at just how dilapidated it has become suggests youaposll need far deeper pockets toit to its former glory.Listed by Allsop, it provides  bedrooms, four dormitories, a principalaposs flat, a staff flat, a caretakeraposs flat, a two storey hostel block, outbuildings and gargaing.The picturesque setting and grand exterior belie the true scale of the renovation job required, with photos of the interior showing floorboards and structures rotten through, with a huge clearance job needed to clear the abandoned school furniture. The description reads: The property is presented in a poor state of repair and requires extensive works of modernisation and refurbishment. The property may afford possible potential for redevelopment and or a number of alternative uses, subject to obtaining all necessary consents. If youaposre able to look beyond the current state of repair, the ultimate do-er upper does come with some incredible benefits, including sprawling land, original fittings and an estate that wouldnapost look out of place on Downton Abbey.

Trees planted in the garden included a weeping beech tree, which is an ideal base for building a den under branches.

A poll of , adults saw the British staple of fried or grilled bacon sandwiched between two chunky slices of bread come out on top. Other popular fillings include cheese and pickle, chicken and bacon, and even a filling of crisps. The results show a sht in tastes, with a similar study from  seeing a plain cheese sandwich top the chart. This was followed by ham and cheese - which has now slipped to sixth place - with the nation favouring sausage, and egg mayonnaise two years on.  It also emerged that when it comes to preparing the perfect sandwich, aposwhite, medium sliced bread with the crusts left on and cut into squaresapos, is the top choice. A spokesman for Warburtons, which commissioned the  and  studies, said: However you prepare it, or whatever you fill it with, thereaposs something that canapost be beaten about a good old British sandwich. Itaposs interesting to see bacon top the list as weaposre all craving comforting, simple and hearty meals as social distancing continues. Itaposs also great to see Brits get more creative in the kitchen with jam and cheese, and even peanut butter and marmalade being used in the nationaposs sandwiches.  The combinations are endless so it comes as no surprise that bread is still one of the nationaposs favourite go-tos. The study also found itaposs not just sandwiches being enjoyed more by the nation, as a third of adults are eating more toasties now than they did before the lockdown, with cheese the most popular filling. And among the best loved condiments to enjoy with sandwiches were pickle , ketchupand mayonnaise . Others choose to spice up their sarnie with a splash of sriracha , a drop of tabascoor a spread of English mustard .  It also emerged almost half of those polled are eating more bread, while a third are enjoying more toast since the start of lockdown. The average person will enjoy four sandwiches and two toasties during a typical week - but a fth are currently tucking into more than seven sandwiches in a seven-day period. As a result, the average household is getting through two loaves of bread a week - with a quarter consuming more than three loaves in that time. Nearly a third Brits said the reason theyaposve had more bread is because they arenapost buying as many meals away from home, and  per cent put it down to having lots of other food in the house which goes well with it. Lunch is still the most popular time to enjoy a sarnie or toastie with  per cent doing so, while a quarter of Brits frequently indulge by snacking on a sandwich.  More than a third actually prefer sandwiches for lunch over a hot meal, and  per cent would even struggle to go a day without enjoying a slice of bread. However, people are no longer creatures of habit as  per cent of those polled, via OnePoll, try to alternate their sandwich fillings, and one in  have been more experimental with fillings during lockdown. Some of the strange and unusual creations put together by the UK were also revealed with one respondent admitting to enjoying a chocolate spread and salami sandwich. Another confessed to eating a chocolate biscuit sandwich, with corned beef and peanut butter also among the inventive combinations.

At the start of lockdown  weeks ago only essential shops were allowed to stay open which led to a huge demand on supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda.Discount stores such as Home Bargains and BM have also been coping with high numbers of customers visiting each day, Liverpool Echo reports.The lockdown meant all other stores, including the majority on high streets across the UK were ordered to close and have remained shut since March . On the Government website the guidance has now been updated to state stores selling homeware are allowed to reopen which is why Matalan today announced it had reopened a selected number of stores.

Zoology student Lucy Patterson began feeling short of breath after a home workout, but put it down to the intense exercise. The University of Liverpool undergraduate had no underlying health conditions and thought she was low risk. But after collapsing eight days later on April , she called her GP who told her to call an ambulance. Lucy had developed pneumonia in % of her lungs and spent eight days on a ventilator at Liverpool University Hospital. The student from Ballymoney, Northern Ireland, revealed her story to student news site The Tab. She said: It just felt like my lungs were tiny. It felt like I was really conscious of the amount of oxygen I was getting in and breathing out. I initially thought, aposoh, this has been a really tough workout, Iaposve overdone it, Iaposve overdone the squats.apos Like most people doing lockdown, Iaposve been so bored that Iaposve just done exercise every day - before, I was a bit more sporadic. Theyaposd been going fine and I was really enjoying them. It was only when the shortness of breath started that I realised something was wrong, because it was the exact same workout that had been fine every day before.  But it took me hours of lying down on the sofa before I was fit enough to go upstairs again. It started feeling like I was a bit more out of breath doing things, so I didnapost take it to be that serious - I just thought maybe I was having a slow day. But as the days went on, it just felt like my lungs got smaller and smaller. Lucy had stayed with her housemates in Smithson, Liverpool to avoid spreading the virus to her parents back home. She had to tell her parents Helen Patterson,  and Michael Patterson, , about the seriousness of her condition over Facetime. She said: Before I was also in the aposuni canapost be over yetapos mentality and wanted to stay on with my flatmates and try and make lockdown fun - ironic.  It must have been very scary for my parents - I called them pretty much every day and they were just getting snippets of how I was progressing, whereas I was seeing it continuously. They saw me deteriorating with every call. I was so blase about it, so my family were much more concerned about me than I was. Lucy spent eight days on a ventilator, but admitted it wasnapost as scary as she had imagined. She now regrets not going to hospital sooner. I was definitely a part of that group before that was really blase about it. I do a science subject, so Iaposd seen the statistics for young people.  I was like, aposthe likelihood of me getting this, let alone it affecting me in any way is so small - I donapost need to worry.apos But when youaposre lying in that hospital bed, you donapost knowyouaposre going to be that .% thataposs going to be unlucky. I wasnapost improving for about five days, so it could have gone the other way for me. Everyone deserves help - just because someone is worse off than you, doesnapost mean that you need to save a hospital bed. If youaposre sick, youaposre helping the doctors more by going in early and getting checked, rather than trying to wait it out in your bed and then getting to the point youaposre so sick an ambulance has to come pick you up.

Prof John Wright, head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research at Bradford Royal Infirmary , said there were  new cases six days after the VE Day anniversary on May . Up until that point, the number of cases at the hospital had been reducing, with only three reported on Monday May . But three days later, on Thursday May , the number of cases shot up to  - a figure Prof Wright suspects has come from VE parties that ended in fist fights or embraces. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here   Writing in a diary for the BBC, the professor said: Itaposs just one figure, and in normal times we might discount it as random iation. However these are times of alertness, and every flicker of the Covid dashboard needle triggers nervous anticipation of a possible spike. There is a delay between infection and symptoms, usually about five-to-seven days.  So these cases would have been incubating since the week before - and possibly since the communal gatherings on VE Day, six days earlier. VE Day - the th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe in World War Two - would have been marked in a huge way at any other time. But in this current climate, communities did what they could within lockdown limitations. Although staff at the AE department at BRI were acutely aware of a lack of care in social distancing as they dealt with many assault cases involving alcohol that night. AE consultant David Greenhorn said: Itaposs not possible to punch someone from m away.

Scott Waring, who runs a YouTube channel and website called ET Data Base, says the peculiar shape is located on a apossmall and uninhabited island in Indonesiaapos.He says he believes it to be a doorway to an aposunderground alien baseapos, as it doesnapost fit in with its environment and is in a secluded location where aposaliens would love to have a hidden baseapos. Using a tool on Google Earth, he measured the opening to find it was  metres across, which he says is big enough to aposget a lot of alien ships in thereapos. You can check it out for yourself on Google Earth by searching the coordinates: °apos.S °apos.E. Writing about the discovery on his website, Scott says: I found an entrance to an underground base on a secluded island in Indonesia. The doorway can easily be seen with Google Earth map and when you add contrast to a screenshot the detail really comes out.We can even tell from looking at it that the UFO that flew through this doorway was leaving the underground base. How do we know this  Because the deeper insides of the tunnel are collapsed and closed in, but the outer surfaces area is still open. This is the perfect place for an underground base on such a secluded island where few people ever wander. In a video posted on YouTube, Scott inspects the image further, saying: That is just amazing to me, that is totally unnatural. That is an alien entrance to an underground base people. He argues the formation of the opening proves the UFO was leaving the base to go aposto the skyapos.  Others praised Scott for the find, with one writing: I think this is entrance specically for the interstellar ships. It is well known that Reptiloidsuse cigar-shaped ships or cylindrical shaped ships. And now. Look at the shape of the entrance! Itaposs clearly for their ships!

Another supporter said: “Everyone shouted at her, but no one paid attention that she was dressed in this way because of the heat. “Maybe you need to yell at the management … because there is no normal air conditioning here.” Marina Astakhova posted: Well done, she raised the mood of the patients.” While Valery Kapnin wrote: “Why punish the nurse, you need to reward her. “Seeing this outfit, no-one wants to die.” "},{"url":null,"title":"thousands pack wuhan theme park","story":"NewsThousands pack into Wuhan theme park after .million tests carried out in cityHealth officials in the Chinese city say they carried out more than , Covid- tests in a day, meaning half Wuhans population has now been tested for the virusShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video wuhan-reopens-theme-park-despite-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news thousands-pack-wuhan-theme-park-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The killer virus, which has claimed more than , lives around the world, is believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan late last year. But the Chinese government claims huge strides have been made in battling the disease, and le is slowly going back to normal in the epicentre. Yesterday the theme park, which was founded in , welcomed , people as it threw open its gates - in spite of fears that China could be set for a second wave of infections. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, click here  It is now allowed to operate at % of its previous capacity. People have to book in advance and have their temperatures taken before they enter. It comes after authorities in Wuhan said they have already screened more than half of its population - including doing half a million tests in a single day this week. Figures released by the Wuhan Health Commission yesterday showed that , nucleic acid tests had been carried out the previous day. Just  new cases - of people who were not showing symptoms - were identied. The city is aiming to have tested every person by May . Described as a apos-day battleapos, the mass testing initiative started on May  - with the central municipal government ordering all  of its districts to come up with their own way to test every resident within its borders. Parks and public squares are being used as assembly points and makesht swabbing stations. Each Covid- test takes about three minutes, while the procedure is free to the public, officials said.  Health officials in Hubei Province in Central China say more than half of Wuhanaposs population has been tested so far, though, according to local media reports, some three million residents had also been tested during lockdown. While it is not mandatory for members of the public to take part in the testing campaign, officials have described it as a responsibility.  The tests are mainly targeting the elderly and children, who would not have been tested in large numbers during lockdown. Wuhan officials believe mass testing is the only way to ensure the safe reopening of schools and businesses. But they remain cautious and have refused to rule out the possibility of a secondary outbreak.

Thankfully, Gimenez was unhurt and referee Victor Carrillo called off the match.Unfortunately, the fans in attendance didn’t see it that way.The suspended match sparked protest from spectators as they responded by throwing objects onto the field and lighting flares.Delia Gallagher contacted BwB with a query from her -year-old father-in-law George ‘Spud’ Martin, a former welder.She said: “Many, many years ago, Georgewent out with a girl who said her cousin was Donald Houston, the Welsh film star.“He thinks her uncle, Donald’s dad, left Dundee to play football down in Wales.“Can you findthere’s any truth in this.”Donald Houston, who appeared in movies such as The Blue Lagoon, The Longest Day and Where Eagles Dare, had a dad called Alexander, who was listed in his bio as a ‘Scottish professional footballer’.An Alexander Houston played for Clydebank, Bathgate and Falkirk in the s.Can any readers add to this tale Returning to a George, he is the author of ‘A Keek Inside’, a book of cartoons and writing from when he was working with Kestrel.Continuing our look back at old Sporting Post Queries.SPQ – In May , “FM” asked: Did Arkle ever run on the flat, and did he win SPA – Arkle ran in two bumper races in Ireland, finishing third and fourth.He then won for the first time in the Bective Novices Hurdle at Navan on January , , at -.I’ve come across some tales regarding football referees which I’ll share in the coming weeks.A Scottish theme to start with, and it was reported in  that . . .Glasgow referee Kenny Hope is now using the coin issued to all officials in Red China before tossing up before kick-off.Instead of asking for heads or tails, bemused skippers are asked to choose from the side with black and gold spots, or the red side emblazoned with a dragon.There has been much correspondence over the years regarding the old and much-loved Saturday evening institution, The Sporting Post.STV reporter Craig Millar revealed he worked for the newspaper in his fledgling years.He said: “The Sporting Post was a magical publication – out in the city centre by .pm with match reports up to about the th minute, then the full edition just after pm.“I loved writing match reports in The Sporting Post, which I did in the late s, mainly following Dundee United around Scotland.“That was partly because a DFC fanatic and senior reporter Bert Young did the Dark Blues games.“Notable matches I reported on included the Dundee derby League Cup Final at Dens in , with swaying crowds on the terracing, the  Rangers v Celtic Scottish Cup Final when the riot took place, and Maradona scoring for Argentina against Scotland at Hampden in .“Unforgettable.”John Hunter commented: “It was amazing how quickly it was out to buy before the digital age we live in now.“It’s definitely missed.

My granddad got out of the hospital and he’s been battling Covid,” the -year-old said.“He’s had it for a while. It’s been a long process which started back in the beginning of March when he first started to feel ill.“He went in to the hospital for  days or so. I was still in Dundee so we had to FaceTime or Zoom call the family to keep updated on everything.“Thankfully, we were able to find some flights and get back over.“He’s healthy now which is great. It’s been great to see him recover and nice to be here with the family.“The challenge now is getting back over to Scotland but, thankfully, I’ve got a UK passport so I should be OK!”Harkes travelled back to the states with fiancée and Celtic Women’s player Sarah Teegarden a few weeks back.Their wedding plans are on hold and the country is in disarray but Harkes insists it’s nice to spend precious time with his loved ones.He continued: “She was able to come back as well which is good.“It’s nice to spend time together but all our wedding plans will be pushed back now.“On the mental side being back with them all helps tremendously, missing them throughout the year.“They came over around Christmas time but seeing them again six months later has been big. It always gives me a lt.“It’s a bit dferent here than the UK. Some things don’t seem so shut down but that’s just America right now – we’re not quite sure what’s going on.“It’s quite crazy just now with the amount of cases and, unfortunately, the amount of deaths we’ve had in America.“I think the country’s a little bit all over the place, some places are opening up and some are closed, but right now we’re still in lockdown in Virginia.“All the states are dferent but it’s been OK here.“I’m not sure how long that will be but we need to be safe, especially with having that experience in my family.“I think we’ve all had a little bit of a dferent view towards it but we’ll see how it goes and hope for the best.“We can still exercise and things like that. I’ve had space to go and run and cycle, do some things in the yard and touch a ball every day.“It’s been good to have certain resources back home and to keep doing stuff.”Like most, lockdown has been a test for Harkes’ mentally and physically. For him, it’s a challenge he soon hopes to rise to on the pitch.Harkes added: “It’s definitely been a challenge on both sides but, thankfully, the club provided us with a great fitness programme before we went on furlough to keep us ticking over.“I’ve been active and all of us want to be flying when we finally get the go-ahead to get back to playing.“We’re all trying to push each other and push ourselves.“On the mental side, the way we ended was a little tough because we wanted to play for the fans and finish out the season.“We really felt like we deserved the title and we knew it then but we just wanted to finish off the games and prove it to everyone.“We’ll have that desire to get back on the pitch and play hard when we finally get it going.”The United support have taken to Harkes since he joined the club in January last year, as much for his flowing locks as his skill on the pitch.He is pleased to inform them nothing has changed on the hair front in lockdown but that he might soon be forced to take matters into his own hands.“I’m still going strong but it will be cut before everything gets going again,” Harkes said.“I think it’s getting a bit ridiculous now.“I don’t want to start putting it up in a bun and everything.

However, I’m getting the sneaking feeling now just isn’t the right time.That might come as a surprise to people who have read this column over the past few weeks andIt seems like we are slowly moving toward the game eventually restarting.Yesterday’s announcement of the Premiership being called with Celtic champions and Hearts relegated came as no surprise.There was no other credible option.The Jambos will, obviously, feel aggrieved and so will some Rangers fans but it is the right call.I said from the start of the shutdown that reconstruction is the only way to ensure no club is unduly affected by leagues ending early.And I still stand by that.However, the situation we are in now a couple of months down the line leads me to pause for thought.Clubs are in such dire straits right now, nobody really knows how many might go to the wall before the game restarts.If we’ve already agreed reconstruction and, say, five clubs go under, we have to start the whole process over again.The decision-makers in the game have shown over the past few farcical weeks that there’s a realI can see where the Premiership clubs were coming from when they canned the revamp talks  days ago.It looks like a mammoth job to get football back on the pitch sometime soon, eventhe SPFL are planning to restart again in July.With that in mind, I’d prefer reconstruction talks were put on the back burner – not binned, by any means – and talked about in a measured fashion over the next few months.Start the new season as normal – eventhings have to wait a few weeks to get the green light – and then get a plan in place for the season after.That way, the new set-up comes from a foundation of stability rather than the uncertainty the game is surrounded by right now and what the future might hold.At the very least, clubs can now plan for the season ahead, knowing who they will be facing eventhere are still doubts around.The big thing for all clubs is getting that stability back, that certainty to then plan ahead.It feels like that’s coming – once it’s back, start talking reconstruction to improve our game in the long-term.I felt for a couple of my old team-mates who were released by their clubs over the weekend.The coronavirus pandemic is obviously a dficult time for everybody but being without a job through it is horrible.Particularly when there’s no prospect right now of finding another employer.With football clubs unable to make moves in the transfer market because of the shutdown, that leaves players like Danny Swanson and Craig Conway in limbo.Normally, I’d expect them to have plenty of offers to think over this summer.Swansonis one of the most talented players I’ve ever seen in training.He was superb at Tannadice.He obviously hasn’t played so much at St Johnstone for whatever reason, leading to his departure.Conway, meanwhile, has had a really successful career since leaving United.He was always such a fit guy and a great lad to have in the dressing-room, he’d normally find a new club no problem.Right now, though, nobody knows what will happen.I was pleased to see Dundee say they were extending some contracts.Christie Elliott’s for another year, a clause he had in his deal, and Paul McGowan, Josh Meekings and Tom Field till July. Even though that’s just a few weeks, it sends the right message – that they are going to look after players.I don’t imagine every club will be doing that.A lot of players will have a stressful summer coming up with no club able to sign them.Theof football with the Bundesliga starting at the weekend was very much a step in the right direction for me.It might have been a bit strange without the crowds but needs must.

qualification","story":"Aberdeen captain Joe Lewis praised the achievement of securing European qualication for a seventh straight season, but admits he has no idea what format the Europa League will take.The decision to end the Premiership campaign with eight rounds of games remaining confirmed fourth placed Aberdeen’s Europa League qualication.However, with the vast majority of European nations still in shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, uncertainty remains over when the Dons’ Europa League campaign will start and what the format will be.At an executive committee meeting scheduled for May  UEFA were expected to set out the plan for completing this season#s Champions League and Europa League.European football’s governing body were also expected to deliver a blueprint for next season’s Euro competitions.That executive committee meeting has been postponed until June .The three options reportedly being considered by UEFA are to play the qualying rounds, which Aberdeen would be involved in, as planned or as a one-leg basis at a neutral venue.Another option is to scrap some,not all of the earlier pre-qualying rounds, but  UEFA have stated it is not planning on depriving clubs of the chance to progress through games, but they may be left with no choice.Lewis said: “It is a great achievement for the club.“It is pleasing that we have Europe from fourth place.“We want to keep kicking forward and to improve next season.“I don’t know how the European competition will work with the travelling for the qualiers.“We are in it and how they structure it and get the games on is not our problem at the moment.”Aberdeen have traditionally started in the Europa League pre-qualiers in July but that will not happen this year.UEFA plan to have the   Champions League and Europa League completed in August, having given European top flights enough time to finish their campaigns suspended by Covid-.In a time of uncertainty over when domestic and European action will start for Aberdeen, the SPFL board at least delivered some clarity by ending the Premiership campaign earlier this week.SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan recently confirmed everything #humanely possible# must be done to secure ato action by the end of July.However, Scottish Government clinical director Professor Jason Leitch insists that time frame is too soon.Lewis said: “It’s our close season now, we have been given our programmes so the lads have to do them ourselves.“Hopefully we will come back before too long, there are a few dates.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSuch is the all-consuming impact of the coronavirus pandemic and response on all our lives, it is something of a relief to report something away from the subject.The relatively new owner of Inveraray Pier wants to encourage community involvement, but people will need to raise moneythey choose to get involved. A community buy-out was, in fact, an option mooted in the bad old days, but negotiations proved dficult at that time.With a new spirit of openness, this has to be an opportunity worth grasping. Inveraray has pretty well lost its connection with Loch Fyne since the pier has been out of bounds. To have full control over the pier is something townsfolk have dreamt of for years.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity. What is yours Already safety rules for the bug are being set by my children.

short term, standards in new development are not prejudiced to stimulate growth.ldquoThe ambitions around climate change, ecology, health and well-being, equality, connectivity, inclusive growth and place-making remain.East Lothian Council wants the National Development designation given to the former Cockenzie Power Station site in previous frameworks to be expanded to include the new town of Blindwells which is underway on nearby land, in the new NPF.The council believes that National Development status for the wider area including nearby Blindwells would support ambitions for sustainable growth and an emerging vision for the area to be an influential, innovative, healthy and carbon neutral location.And they say the larger site could become one of Scotlands top ten low carbon locations.While the boundaries of the area are still to be finalised it could stretch out to cover existing communities of Tranent, Prestonpans, Cockenzie and Port Seton and Longniddry.Councillor Norman Hampshire, East Lothian Council spokesperson for Environment, said it was important the county continued to plan for the future during the Covid- outbreak.And he said it was important the ambitions set out before the lockdown continued to be at the heart of decisions made.He said: ldquoWe are ambitious for East Lothian and want to see it remain as a great place in which to live and work, which is well connected with good employment opportunities and sustainability principles at its heart.The local authority has asked Scottish Ministers to designate an area known as The Blindwells, Cockenzie and Climate Change Zone, as a National Development.Councillor Hampshire said: ldquoWe want to see the new settlement at Blindwells developed as a fantastic community in which to live and work.ldquoIt should be a zero emissions community embracing climate change objectives and embracing blue green infrastructure and bioersity.ldquoThe former Cockenzie Power Station site offers signicant opportunity in terms of economic development and employment and work continues to understand its potential.ldquoIn our proposal for a National Development, we are suggesting that a Climate Change Zone is created between these sites, and including parts of, neighbouring communities and sites.ldquoWe believe this wider area, part of the former East Lothian coalfield, could be one of Scotlandrsquos top  locations for low carbon, sustainable inclusive growth and we are determined to grasp the opportunity.ldquoWe are making our case in a submission to the Scottish Government and will be carrying out public engagement on the extent of our vision for the area in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"capital-fm-hold-virtual-best-summertime-ball---one-direction-among-line-up","story":"Every June, Capitals Summertime Ball usually takes place at Wembley Stadium in

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig. This was recently voted the greatest rail journey in the world and includes the iconic Glenfinnan Viaduct which featured in the Harry Potter movies."},{"url":null,"title":"jura-red-wine-cask-finish-review","story":"% ABVRRP pound for a one-litre bottleTHE Isle of Jura ndash a remote, almost desolate place, sat between the mainland and that whisky Shangri-La, Islay.The population is tiny ndash barely  ndash and therersquos only one road of any note.George Orwell lived there, and completed Nineteen Eighty-Four there.

Keir Starmer has made much of his working class roots. The son of a nurse and a toolmaker, he rose through the grammar school system to take a first at Leeds University then become a human rights lawyer before being appointed director of public prosecutions in England.The Sunday paper in question slipped in that Sir Keir was making pound an hour in his lawyering days, which seems somewhat a bargain for a Doughty Street silk.His mother, we learn, was no longer able to go outside to care for the donkeys towards the end of her le but enjoyed watching them from the window of her home, which overlooked the field.The story also says that Sir Keir has a \"half share\" in his late parents semi-detached house, which is on the market for pound,. Presumably this means that hes inherited the property from his parents, making another unusual step for a right wing paper to be critical of inheritance.Unless he was throwing bunga bunga parties with the donkeys, this isnt much of a scoop. Its surely preferable that he filled a field with donkeys than a cabinet with asses.The land, were told, would be worth pound million, were it not green belt land, which cant currently be redeveloped, and were Sir Keir looking to sell, which he says he is not.I suppose the idea is that the Labour leader is a hypocrite for calling himself a socialist while owning assets worth several million.

Jeremy Hunt bought seven properties and entirely forgot about them.This attempt to discredit Sir Keir by suggesting hes too rich to be trusted comes as his approval ratings rise above those of Mr Johnsons for the first time.As the pandemic wrought its awful effects on the UK, there was a general sense that politics as usual should be set aside and a sense of unity displayed as the government set out how it would deal with the health and economic effects of Covid-.At the beginning of the pandemic there wasnt an awful lot for the opposition to do as the measures being suggested were largely of the left anyway.Mr Johnsons approval ratings were highest when he was away from the role and there was a general consensus that it would be inappropriate to criticise the Prime Minister in his sick bed. Now hes ed to the day job and seems wholly unprepared for Sir Keirs forensic questioning at PMQs, perhaps having grown used to far less pointed interrogation from the Labour leaders predecessor.As furious concerns are being raised about the governments handling of the pandemic, of deaths in care homes, lack of adequate PPE for front line staff, and the effects of systemic inequality, as a small example, all eyes now turn to the opposition.Keir Starmer is currently giving the impression of a sensible man with a robust grasp of what his role is and certainly the reports of his performance so far are positive.At the same time, the measures put in place to deal with the social effects of the pandemic are being rolled back. The Mayor of Manchester has raised concerns the provisions for housing rough sleepers are to be ended. There is a war being raged against teachers.As I wrote several weeks ago in this column, there had been a pledge by Priti Patel to end the surcharge paid by overseas doctors - that has been dropped.There are suggestions that we might, as a society, emerge from this crisis with a positive shake up of the old ways and a greener, fairer, more equal new order put in its place. To achieve this will take radical thinking and hard pressure from the left.The political ceasefire is ending and this brief smear attempt on Sir Keir is a sign of politics ing to business as usual. Business as usual is one thing, but the Labour leader must force policy away from the usual and towards something more progressive.

A shop assistant was palpably distressed as she told me she couldnrsquot go with her pregnant daughter for her scan, or see the twins she usually collects twice a week from school. One of my friends had booked to fly to Australia to be with her daughter when her baby ndash the first grandchild ndash arrived. Instead, she is stranded thousands of miles away, anxiously watching the calendar, and knitting, knitting, knitting.Itrsquos no surprise that the likes of Zoom and Facetime have become emotional le-rafts, with everyone rushing to climb aboard. Earlier this week, my sister was making granola with an eight-year-old, an hourrsquos drive away in Glasgow. With four of her grandsons in one household, portal sessions can be chaotic. The two-year-old usually makes an appearance only at the bottom of the screen, detected by a tuft of blond hair moving at speed beyond reach.If you could see the profiles of those using this technology, yoursquod find it flooded with retirees, desperate for a glimpse of their families and their youngest. It might be a poor substitute for a hug, but most would agree that online chats are better than nothing. Children grow so swtly, time-lapse photography would make you giddy. They shoot up faster than Leylandii, and learn new words every day. My great-nephewrsquos favourite just now is ldquodisgusting. He applies this to his motherrsquos cooking.Half the older population is probably, like me, filling their devices with adorable pictures, and frantically upgrading their cloud storage to contain it all. It makes me wonder, did my grandparents delight in photos of my siblings and me  Irsquoll never know. Thinking of them is like going back to another place and time ndash which is where, as Edwardian Londoners, they came from. When I was a girl, most folk were considered decrepit at . And often they were, worn out from work and hardship. Reaching retirement was the time for pipe and slippers rather than bungee jumping or skying. The grandchildren who visited once a week, or month, or at Christmas, were patted on the head, spoken to in a loud voice, and indulged with sweets. When it was time to leave, there was rarely any protest.I used to envy school friends whose aged relatives were closely involved with their lives. Today, that closeness is taken for granted, as the older folks work a rota, caring for youngsters after school or during holidays, while their parents work.It is one of the loveliest rapports to observe. In a culture that puts a lot of pressure on the young, to do well at school or university, to look good and be popular, the advice and companionship of those who have seen it all, and take a relaxed view, is invaluable. Therersquos much hand-wringing about the state of modern society, with fractured or dysal families causing heartache and instability. Not much is said, however, of the role grandparents play in holding things together and nurturing those on the first and most precarious rungs of le.Adjectives that can be applied to most working mothers and fathers include irritable, harassed and exhausted. Those over , especially once their careers have ended, have shot those rapids and are in calmer waters. Grandchildren instinctively recognise that theyrsquoll find in them a champion who puts them first, whether itrsquos as a bulwark against strict rules and nagging, or simply someone who isnrsquot always watching the clock. Time and patience are the most important gt a grandparent has to give: to play, read, go for a walk, watch a film, or take a child to football practice and roar encouragement from the sidelines. It doesnrsquot really matter what they actually do together, simply having someonersquos attention for a few hours is priceless. And for granddads especially, I suspect, itrsquos a chance to offer something they had in too short supply when they were raising their own brood.In terms of the family machine, therersquos never been a time when this ageing cohort has been more crucial to its smooth running. With most parents working within a year or two of a childrsquos birth, the period when offspring need to be collected from nursery, or be cared for after school or out of term-time, has signicantly expanded. Only recently have economists begun to calculate the worth of this unpaid army of nannies, chauffeurs, shuttlers, carers, cooks, cleaners and counsellors.It wonrsquot surprise anyone who falls into this group to learn that the hidden price of childcare on the national balance sheet is huge. One analysis in  estimated that, on average, such help annually saves a family pound. Thatrsquos pound billion across the UK. Few grandparents would ever see their contribution in pounds and pence, even those who are far from well-off themselves. Yet it is implicitly understood that without their help, countless thousands of households would struggle to hold down their jobs and make ends meet.The ongoing effect of Covid  on contact between generations could be profound. As the world s to work, many grandparents will be obliged to watch on, from relative isolation, for who knows how much longer But for most who are in this predicament, itrsquos not the maths thatrsquos worrying them. It is the absence of physical contact: fingers sticky with chocolate, displays of cartwheels and bunny jumps, revision schedules more complicated than a ScotRail timetable. And it is a two-way loss, children missing out as much as they do. The loving web that binds young and old is usually invisible, and passes largely unnoticed. Yet, as wersquoll soon see, itrsquos a crucial network that keeps the country running.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He suggested the motivation was to ensure the Prime Minister had more support behind him during Prime Ministers Questions on a Wednesday.He added: \"It has even been reported that the Leader of the House suggested that to get more MPs in, perspex screens should be installed between the benches and between members. Someone has obviously told him how things are being done in Tesco these days.\"In recent weeks we have demonstrated that the business of this house can be done from behind a screen, as we do right now, but it is from behind a computer screen not a screen of perspex, the only purpose of which would be to shield the Government from scrutiny and the Prime Minister from ridicule. The Leader of the House must think again.\"SNP MP Tommy Sheppard added the move was going to subject Westminster to \"ridicule\", secically referring to the way voting would be carried out.He said: \" I know that a physical vote has been trialled indeed, I have seen the pictures, and I think once the public see how that is proposed we will be in danger of exposing this Parliament to even greater ridicule.\"Why is the Leader prepared to go to any s, it seems, no matter how ridiculous, not to continue with the system that is already in place and that works Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, replied that the MP was a \"separatist\" and said he \"does not wish this parliament to be the parliament of the United Kingdom\".The Conservative MP also highlighted incidences where technology such a video-conferencing had not worked during committees and debates as one of the reasons to bring MPs back.However he said that the Commons would be a Covid-secure workplace by the time recess ends.The LibDems later said the Conservatives were putting the public at risk, with Mr Carmichael adding: \"It is an insult to those who have suffered and died for Jacob Rees-Mogg to suggest that MPs should put their communities at risk by travelling hundreds of miles to London each week for the whims of the Government.\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmTonight#s television viewing is sorted as Orkney features in two BBC programmes tonight.

The Orcadian is awaiting clarication on how this will be put into practice in Orkney.Speaking about the enhancement of key worker testing, NHSO chief executive designate, Iain Stewart said: “Testing will be undertaken at the COVID- Assessment Centre with results being available within hours rather than days.#Currently our laboratory continues to provide a clinical service and the health board is confident at this time that demand for COVID- testing can be met and will be managed daily. However, it may be necessary on occasions to prioritise other cohorts such as those in Group One when demand for testing exceeds capacity”.   If you are a key worker, and you or a family member is symptomatic of COVID- — a fever or a new and persistent cough for more than half a day, or a change in your sense of taste or smell — you may be eligible for COVID- testing. You can see the full list of keyworkers and their priority categories in Scotland by clicking here.Sara Lewis, consultant in public health at NHS Orkney added: “The testing process will not include a health assessment. It is recommended thatyou are displaying symptoms of COVID- you should visit the NHS Inform website in the first instance or contact NHSto seeyour symptoms are consistent with COVID- infection“If NHS advise symptoms are consistent with COVID- and home isolation is required you should contact your employer to obtain a copy of the testing referral form. A copy of the form can  be requested by visiting NHS Orkney’s website or emailing HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk ”.“Completed testing forms should be emailed from an employee’s line manager or human resources deparment representative, where available, but in any case providing verication that they’re absence from work, on account of self-isolating, is preventing their respective organisation from operating and providing an essential service in Orkney. #Forms should be emailed to the gateway address of HighlandIslandMailKirkwall@scotland.pnn.police.uk which is co-ordinating the testing service on behalf of Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordinating Groupwith the exception of Orkney Islands Council employees or health and social care workers who should continue to access COVID- testing through the process currently in place.“On receipt of the referral the testing centre will contact you or your household member to offer an invite for testing. Test results should be available on the same day as testing, iniduals will be contacted by the COVID- Assessment Centre who will confirm the test results with the inidual and their employer. Test results of household members will be anonymised in line with Scottish Government guidance.“Any iniduals found to have a positive COVID- test result this will be reported to their line manager, their GP and NHS Orkney’s Public Health Department for follow up”OLECG chairman, Chief Inspector Matt Webb said: “We would like to thank all the keyworkers who continue to work so hard to ensure services continue, enabling us to safeguard and protect the residents of Orkney.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL#s modernisation plans would see air traffic control operations at a five airports, including Kirkwall Airport, centralised to a control centre in Inverness, using remote tower technology.Speaking last week, councillor Graham Sinclair, chairman of OIC#s Development and Infrastructure Committee, said:“We need to fully understand the impact on our community before any decision is made to create a remote air traffic control centre in Inverness.”“So it is disappointing that the government and HIAL have disregarded a call by this council, and others, for them to undertake an Islands Impact Assessment before by moving ahead with their plans.“We asked for this earlier in the year and expected the assessment to be completed before HIAL began to undertake a procurement process.”Councillor Sinclair added: “An immense amount of work was undertaken before the passing of the IslandsAct to ensure that Islands Impact Assessments would be carried out to give communities like ours a say when major changes such as this are proposed.“This appears to have been ignored on this occasion, which is why we are asking for the process to be paused until an assessment is undertaken.”HIAL#s position is that impact assessment is being carried out. Spokesman said: “An island impact assessment is currently underway and is being undertaken by an independent consultant. This will include consultation with local authorities and community groups. It is anticipated that the process will be completed and a draft report produced by June .“While every endeavour will be made to maintain this timescale [for the IIA], we acknowledge that the current restrictions and physical distancing requirements may require this timeline to be extended.”“Procuring remote tower technology is part of the next phase of our ATMS Programme. This technology will help deliver sustainable aviation connectivity and deliver a flexible, resilient air traffic service that will be highly adaptable as we ensure our airports are fit for the future.“The procurement process for such tenders is a y process We anticipate that the process to procure the remote tower technology solution will be completed by December  January .“We have reviewed our capital programme to allow us to implement key projects, and have other projects shelf-ready for when we are able toto some semblance of normality.

In Orkney, this currently stands at two and seven respectively.However, the Scottish Government and NHS Orkney have refused so far to confirm the number of people in each area that have been tested, partly on the basis of concerns around patient confidentiality.Mr McArthur said: “In the absence of a vaccine, any move away from lockdown needs to be backed up by a reliable regime of testing and tracing. We need to keep the virus in sight, so we can properly manage the risk.“If there are any issues in getting this set up, local areas need to know so that those problems can be raised and then fixed.“That is why it is essential that Ministers are as transparent as possible.  Being up front about the amount of testing taking place at a local health board level is a key part of achieving that transparency, keeping people informed and building public confidence.“Without knowing the extent of testing in Orkney, it is dficult to know what to make of the relatively low numbers of confirmed cases of COVID. That is a point I have been reinforcing with Scottish Ministers and NHS Orkney over recent weeks.“The First Minister has called for a ‘grown up’ conversation about how we take the dficult decisions in easing lockdown restrictions.  Grown up conversations, however, are founded on transparency and honesty. That is why we need to see detailed figures on a localised basis.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are having to limit the recycling collections to single green bins each week.#So we would ask people to remain patient and,they cannot fit all their weekly items in a single bin, to continue storing some for future collections.”Green recycling bins and boxes should be put out on your usual bin day. You should remove the caddies inside — and the items for collection should be included in your single green bin or box as the council will be unable to pick up more than one at a time.Grey bincollections for household waste will continue on a fortnightly basis — again on your usual collection day.Councillor Drever added: “We’ve tried to make the arrangements as straight forward as possible.“You’ll be putting a green bin or box out weekly — and a grey bin or red bags once a fortnight. The thing to remember is to do this on the day of the week when your bins would normally be collected.“We will be using a mix of waste and recycling vehicles to help us clear the backlog, with all materials collected to be sent for recycling.”The recycling collections will take place as follows:Meanwhile, the council is currently developing plans for the partial re-opening of some Household Waste Recycling Centres in June, in line with the recent announcement by the local government organisation, COSLA, and subject to further guidance from the Scottish Government.The possibility of resuming recycling collections in Westray and Shapinsay and re-opening isles recycling points is also being looked at.More information will be provided soon.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Government needs to step in and underwrite income lost through fees and teaching grants and, in response, universities must promise to work together on plans for safely reopening and when to recommence face-to-face teaching.A Universities UKspokesman said: ldquoNew and ing students can be confident that UK universities will be teaching high-quality courses this autumn while still prioritising the health and safety of students and staff.ldquoAs we await further clarication and advice about next steps after lockdown, universities are already preparing for a range of scenarios ndash including periods of online and blended study in the academic year -.Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ldquoI understand that this is an incredibly dficult time for students, so it is vital that universities are clear to students about how courses will be delivered in the coming year.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#Fernández makes a good point. The Argentine economy is taking a battering and so is our own but we need to see things in perspective:Last month, Morningstar ran an article about the likely effect of the Coronavirus lockdown on share idends to be paid out by U.K. companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.It set out four possible scenarios, best-case, worst-case, and two “realistic” estimates within that range. In the best-case scenario, overall idends fall % to £. billion, and in the worst they more than halve to £. billion.More recent comments in The Financial Times suggest that we are heading towards a midway point between the best-case and worst-case scenarios while Reuterswarned of a possible % drop in idends “ the situation continues to worsen.”If the economy can afford idend payments of £ billion during the lockdown, I suspect that it is strong enough to recover. Of course, the FT and Reuters are known to be simmering cesspits of socialist subversion, so possibly more fake news.p.s.For the avoidance of any unnecessary tantrums:“The Morning Star” is three words with two spaces whereas “Morningstar” is just one word with no spaces.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Best information as of   .On that basis I think we need Nicola Sturgeon down here in England as well!Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful. In all probability Ian will not strike gold but how thankful we would behe did !!Fake news  Trump tried to buy Moussa and replace the old stone buildingswith a shiny new tower and Miss Sturgeon will use the proceeds to building a border wall.The deal came unstuck when China claimed Shetland as part of its North Sea and Atlantic territorial waters.

This Government has bungled it#s handling of the Covid- crisis on an industrial scale. Exercise Cygnus in October  highlighted serious shortcomings in the UK#s Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response Plan to a pandemic. Since then PPE stock levels were run down by %. Being made aware of the virus in December  no preparation was started until March when the herd immunity strategy was quickly jettisoned. Britain refused to participate in the EU procurement scheme for PPE leading to farcical attempts to obtain PPE from some guy in Turkey who made T shirts. Unsurprisingly the PPE was unusable. Rather than get ventilators from established manufacturers The Government ignored their offers of help and went to Tory donors like James Dyson who managed to produce  of the  needed. Flights bringing  people a day into the Uk without test or quarantine only stopped  months after lockdown. People being placed in care homes without being tested. Unbelievably lockdown is being eased in England without test track and trace being implemented. We have the second highest death total in the world.England does not have the highest number of deaths in Europe, and England has a far higher recovery rate than many in European nations.The Care homes in England have about half the death rate of their Scotish counterparts and the Death Rate per capita in England is considerably less than in Scotland. Just to keep you up to date, Nicola has just today,reversed her political decision on lockdown. The statistics are available online however, ferreting the Scotish records is problematic. For some reason, the SG is far less transparent with the Data than the English. Figures below are slightly out of date but show the comparison.The population of England. ,, No of deaths. , Death ratio. .So in summary, the gospel according to Ian Tinkler is that BoJo the clown hasn#t put his size  feet in it at all as the death rate is higher in Scotland than in England.Ian, I think your calculations are the wrong way round and show what you might call a #survival ratio# rather than a death ratio. There#s also a decimal place error but for the purposes of comparison that doesn#t really matter.If you work it out in deaths per million of population you can see that Scotland has a lower death rate.England:  from      per mPlease do not put words in my mouth Robbie. What is happening in Scotland is down to The SG and Nicola, as theFM and former Health Secretary. Trying to make political capital out of people dying is morally reprehensible, obnoxious and malign. Bo-Jo and Nicola have equal responsibility for any mistakes, they both shared and followed the best science they could. For once they were in harmony and agreement. The NHS was not overwhelmed, lives were saved, be thankful for that. Fortunately, the injection of disinfectant, we will leave to a real clown who is now mainlining hydroxychloroquine!!! Perhaps Darwinism will step in soon! God save America.Oh this is too funny to pass by! Mr Tinkler creates his own, entirely , Coronavirusfigures to make a political point and is immediately shot down. He then states that only an idiot would try to use coronavirus figures to make political points. Well, on that we totally agree # only an idiot would.The vaccine is focusing on a very small sequence in the S viral protein which enables it to bind to the ACE receptor on human cells in mucosal linings and infect them. There isn’t much room for mutation there without the virus losing its ability to bind to that receptor. Other mutations mentioned, in other parts of the virus, enable “strains” of virus to be tracked. Reproduction is subject to errorand billions upon billions of virus are being produced, so mutations will take place. However the critical site for immunity is probably conserved.So, the death ratio in Scotland from Covid , according to the self-proclaimed STE expert is .. That, I believe, is patently incorrect, not to mention entirely absurd, and would mean that . people from  person had died from the disease. As an analogy, based on a notional teeth count,someone had, let’s say, ten teeth and subsequently had one removed then the ratio of teeth removed to those not having been removed would be  , or %. The “survival ratio”, as someone referred to, ie the teeth remaining, is the remainder as a proportion of the whole, in other words  out of , or %, assuming that the dentist extracts within remit. The two equations are not inter-changeable. This, however, from the statistical and other real experts acknowledged in their fields is very interesting: .."},{"url":null,"title":"calls to save shetland tourism industry with 12 month covid 19 support package ","story":"Shetland politicians and business leaders are ramping up pressure on governments to provide better support for the struggling tourism industry during the Covid- crisis – and beyond.MSP Beatrice Wishart has added her voice to the growing chorus of calls pushing for the UK and Scottish governments to help the hospitality businesses survive.Ms Wishart#s calls for a -month support plan for the industry follow comments made by isles MP Alistair Carmichael in Westminster earlier this week.At a meeting in Holyrood, Ms Wishart said tourism businesses might survive  just three months without support.She asked tourism secretary Fergus Ewing about working with the UK government to consider a -month support package to tide the tourism and hospitality sector over into next season.Ms Wishart was told the problems had been recognised problems but a -month fund had not yet been considered.After the meeting she said: “In Shetland the tourism season is shorter compared to other areas of the UK. It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

We#ve been looking at the legislation and it doesn#t seem to allow for the FM transmitter we would need to put it into people#s cars, he continued.All it seems to allow for is  nanowatts to be transmitted which would only broadcast from the church to the front bumper of the first car. That#s not enough for people in the car park to hear it. I#ve contacted Ofcom about this a week ago but we#ve had no response. So we still don#t knowthis is even viable.The Executive has said fire ahead with these drive-in services, but they haven#t given us the wherewithal to do them so it#s really a bit of an empty gesture.An Ofcom spokesperson said: Understandably, the church community is exploring alternative ways of reaching their congregations. To broadcast as you describe, however, churches would require a Broadcasting Act licence to stay within the law. Ofcom would consider applications made for a restricted service licence, and information on the dferent types of licences is available on our website. When considering any application, Ofcom would carry out the work necessary to establisha suitable frequency can be identied for use at a power level appropriate for the proposed coverage area.DUP MLA Gordon Lyons said: I#m sorry that churches are not able to be exempt from licences on this occasion. Churches will understand the need to follow the law, but I would hope application processes will be as quick as possible.Elsewhere, a drive-in service is planned for this Sunday near the Giant#s Causeway at Dunseverick Baptist Church. Far from being a novelty, the outdoor services have been a popular fixture for years. Rev Billy Jones last held a service in March just before lockdown measures were introduced.Everyone needs hope at the moment, this isn#t about just going through the ritual of a service. If this achieves nothing , it will give people a lt just from seeing their family and friends across the car park.Rev Trevor McCormick is also aiming to hold outdoor services from next Sunday in both First Kilrea Presbyterian and the nearby Boveedy Church.

Fiadh was born on the very day Altnagelvin hospital introduced restrictions on visiting, which came a few days before Derry went into full lockdown.It meant both Saoirse#s family, as well as her husband Niall, missed out on meeting Fiadh, who is a sister to Sean.Just over a month later, when Niamh and her partner, Peter, welcomed Reuben - a brother to Elsie - to the world, the Costello family once again were deprived of meeting the latest addition to their clan.Taking advantage of the easing of the lockdown restrictions, the sisters met up in Saoirse#s back garden for a much anticipated cup of coffee and a chat - and, of course, a proper look at the new arrivals.Saoirse said: It is so good to have Niamh here and to actually see my new nephew in front of me is amazing, but I want to hold him so much and that#s hard.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFriends Jenner Ferguson, Charlene Dempsey, Rose McCann and baby Emma McCann meet for the first time in two months for a picnic in Cranmore Park, Belfast, yesterdayPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFriends Jenner Ferguson, Charlene Dempsey, Rose McCann and baby Emma McCann meet for the first time in two months for a picnic in Cranmore Park, Belfast, yesterdayWe chat every day, we have been sending each other videos and photographs, but nothing is a good as the real thing.Reuben looks so beautul - all the pictures in the world don#t do him justice. I cannot get over how much hair he has and I am looking over at him and wonderingI can see similarities between him and Fiadh, but really all I want to do is hold him and cuddle him and tell him I am his auntie Saoirse.It has been so dficult being shut away from Niamh, our parents, our other sister and brothers - but not being able to share the births of our new babies properly with each other has been especially tough.Before our babies were born, we talked about how good it was going to be to both be on maternity leave at the same time - how we could take our babies for walks to the park along with our other two children, go for coffee and call up to our parents# house - but none of that has been possible. We have kept to the Government#s guidelines because obviously we realise how important it is that everyone does everything they can to keep people safe and I am so, so happy that the lockdown has been lted enough to allow us to meet up outside, even though we still have to keep to the rules on social distance.For the past  weeks, it has felt as though we live at opposite ends of the world, even though we are just around the corner from each other, but for now, we are enjoying this.Niamh said: It is incredible to see Fiadh, evenshe is six feet away and I am so happy that Saoirse can see Reuben. This is a day we have both waited so long for. Fiadh is so long, her hair is so dark and she has the most beautul big blue eyes, but I feel the same as Saoirse, I want to hold her. The timing of the births of Fiadh and Reuben could not have been worse because no one has been able to meet them properly.We still can#t go to our parents# house because our mother works in a care home and that is the toughest thing for both of us.It is just natural that when you have a new baby, you want their granny and granda to see them, but our parents have only seen Fiadh and Reuben through the windows of our houses.She added: My mother and father just dote on their grandchildren, they love it when we all congregate there, so not being able to see and hold these two new arrivals I know is really dficult for both of them.All we can do is hope the situation with coronavirus doesn#t get any worse, so we can all get together.

Credit:Steve Parsons PA WirePA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappA person on the NHS coronavirus contact tracing app, which Isle of Wight residents have been trialling. Credit:Steve Parsons PA WireMark BainTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA contact tracing programme involving all confirmed positive cases of Covid- has started in Northern Ireland.The region has become the first of the four devolved nations to launch the plan, with all new positive cases now being traced.Finding all the people someone has been in contact with once they have tested positive for Covid- is seen as a key part in preventing the spread of the disease, according to the Public Health Agency .“This is another example of the herculean work right across the HSC system to fight back against Covid- and keep people safe,” said Health Minister Robin Swann.“The battle against the virus is a long-term challenge and contact tracing will have a very important role as part of that.”Dr Jackie Hyland, Consultant in Health Protection at the PHA, said contact tracing at this stage involves new ways of working given the scale and the fact that new evidence is continually emerging about the illness.“We have teamed up with colleagues in the university sector and Health and Social Care Trusts to put in place all the necessary logistics,” he said.“We are now rolling out contact tracing further and working with the public to support people who may have been exposed so they can get tested and self-isolate to help prevent spread of infection.“We are progressing our plans for scaling up the second phase of the Northern Ireland contact tracing service, informed by the learning from the current pilot programme. This work involves testing all aspects of the programme.“From May  we have been undertaking contact tracing for all confirmed positive cases of Covid-.“Testing is also now available to everyone in Northern Ireland aged over five with symptoms, which will form an important part of the contact tracing programme.“The number of staff currently required changes each day in line with workload, but we have sufficient staff trained and available to manage contact tracing and meet demand.”The Department of Health is also taking forward work around digital solutions that can support the wider contact tracing programme when it goes live.The land border with the Republic of Ireland is an important factor in the spread of infectious diseases and therefore contact tracing.There are well-established systems in place to work with colleagues in the Republic on contact tracing and management of infectious diseases, and the health service is working at pace to develop new, more efficient ways of working collaboratively to reduce the spread of Covid-, and help protect cross-border travellers.For now contact tracing is being carried out exclusively by telephone and in a similar manner to the method used at beginning of the pandemic.“Our very first case was an inidual who landed in Dublin Airport then travelled to Northern Ireland back to their home and we saw the Public Health Agency and the Health Service Executive actually working together to do that contact tracing, so we’re taking that approach to begin with,” the Health Minister said.Mr Swann said he had spoken to his counterpart in the Republic, Simon Harris, on Tuesday morning regarding the development of a contact tracing app and he was also monitoring progress on digital technology within the NHS.“We’re still looking to see which will be the best fit for Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that two apps could be used in Northern Ireland until a bespoke app could be created.He had previously said that his preference would be for a single app which would work across the British Isles, butdferent apps were used they would be compatible.Contact tracing was suspended in Northern Ireland in mid-March. A pilot programme resumed on April  and Mr Swann said he expected the contact tracing service to be in place “for the next year at a minimum”.The Executive, guided by health experts, now believes the focus on contact tracing can help limit any impact of a second wave of Covid-.On Tuesday evening, a virtual meeting to discuss the ongoing response to coronavirus on both sides of the border took place between Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, the First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill, Tanaiste Simon Coveney and the two health ministers.In a joint statement, Mr Coveney and Mr Lewis said they discussed the respective plans for emerging from lockdown “given the importance of implementing consistent approaches wherever possible and strong collaborative arrangements”.“Strong data-sharing arrangements North South would be a necessary part of the easing of restrictions,” they said.What is contact tracing Contact tracing aims to identy and alert people who have come into contact with a person infected with coronavirus.The process starts with someone who has been tested positive for Covid- being asked to list all the people they’ve recently been in prolonged contact with.A contact tracing team member will then phone these contacts and talk to them about their risk of infection. Everyone who has the infection and who is a close contact will have to self-isolate. To be successful in contact tracing people need to provide their phone number when they get a test.Why is it important Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lt restrictions in other countries, like South Korea, when combined with stringent testing measures.The most important element is speed.The five-stage process — sampling, testing, communication to a positive case, contact tracing and contact quarantine — all needs to be done in a -hour window to be effective in preventing spread.Why was it halted Contact tracing was halted by the UK government on March , though that proved to be a controversial move as many experts believed it was key to slowing the spread of the virus. The government was subsequently accused of not having the capacity to run it effectively.On April  the Department of Health in Northern Ireland restarted an ‘enhanced contact tracing pilot’, which, it says, is now operating five days a week. It’s felt by the Executive that it could prove crucial in limiting the impact of any second wave of coronavirus.That service is set to be expanded to operate over seven days soon.How does it operate in Northern Ireland For now, Northern Ireland is relying on telephone contact, but the speed of the process should increase dramaticallya mobile phone app becomes available.The process is off to a slow start and on May  the Health Minister said  staff were trained and working on contact tracing. On that date there were said to be  more tracers in training with a further  volunteers having come forward to join the list.In April Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride had said he estimated  to  staff would be needed for contact tracing to work efficiently.Is a contact tracing app likely to be used The development of an app to speed up the process of contact tracing is seen as key to maximising the impact of the scheme, but that has raised questions over whether Northern Ireland should be involved with the UK or on an all-Ireland basis.At the moment the UK and Irish governments are working on separate apps, but Health Minister Robin Swann said no decision has yet been made on the best way to proceed.The app would be able to identy people the patient may not know — like fellow passengers they have been in contact with on public transport or in supermarkets.But there have been concerns about privacy, particularly in Northern Ireland where security workers who may be reluctant to use it over fears their personal details could be compromised.Should contact tracing be organised on an all-Ireland basis Addressing media earlier this week, the Health Minister insisted there needed to be “a clarity of message”.And while a single app that works across both the UK and the Republic of Ireland would be the best solution for Northern Ireland, the logistics of that are proving problematic. Northern Ireland might have to settle for a compromise,it can be agreed, that would see UK app compatible with one in the Republic, arranged as part of the memorandum of understanding between authorities north and south of the border.Since Ireland is one geographical area, andcontact tracing is to be a long term project, then it makes sense to have an all-island approach.Is this likely to be a long term project The NI Executive has maintained that contact tracing is a crucial component for ending the lockdown, and that wider surveillance of the virus in the community is necessary.The system is expected to be in place for at least a year, possibly longer.

The headache was unreal. When it started coming on the news about the coronavirus and there was a list of the symptoms, it made me think. I#m convinced that it was coronavirus. I#ve never been as sick.Though many people are convinced they may have had coronavirus, medical experts disagree. Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Associationand a GP in Londonderry, says he is convinced that the bug making people sick before Christmas was a dferent virus.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it Dr Tom Black, British Medical AssociationThere certainly was a viral illness in December and January, he says. But it wouldn#t have been consistent with what we then found with the Covid virus. From a patient#s point of view you would have got a sore throat, a temperature, felt unwell, some vomiting and diarrhoea as well. So I suppose there are some similarities but that is because they are both viral illnesses. We certainly didn#t see the level of very severe respiratory symptoms that we then saw with Covid.My view would be consistent with the prevalent view that we wouldn#t have seen Covid in December and January, but we saw other viral illnesses that could have been mistaken for it.Dr Black says that he disagrees with suggestions that December#s widespread illness was in fact the first wave of coronavirus and that we have just left the deadly second wave.Our microbiology colleagues are very clear about when the infection came and when they were able to pick it up on their very accurate tests, he says. I think we are still in the first wave. The severity of Covid was markedly dferent from a standard flu. It is a much more severe illness in a minority and we didn#t see those patients until we were in the pandemic.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Tom Black, chair of the BMA in Northern IrelandAnd Dr Black says, although there are less patients presenting to our hospitals, the virus is still out there. We have fewer cases appearing into general practice. We have fewer cases coming into the Covid centres that the GPs man and we have fewer cases in hospital and in ICU. So in all four areas we have reduced numbers of cases, he says. It#s not gone yet, it#s still endemic in the community. There seems to be a concentration in two places - in care homes and among health care workers. So we are going to have start increasing our testing of patients and staff in care homes, which has been announced by the minister. And we are going to have to increase our testing among health care workers.As for how many of us might have acquired herd immunity, Dr Black also estimates the numbers are still very low, saying that just % of the Northern Irish population might have had the virus already.

In labs around the globe they are racing against time in a frantic bid to create a Covid- vaccine ­- seen as the key to vanquishing the virus and setting society on the road back to normality.The world is waiting, hoping, expecting, but it is a pressure to deliver that weighs heavily on the shoulders of the scientic world.It is said the best way to tackle an enemy is to understand how that enemy operates, and that is why understanding the nature of Covid- is vital.There is still a lot more to find out .. This is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. The problem is, this is still a very new virus, said Dr Ultan Power, professor in molecular virology at Queen#s University.We have learnt so much about it in such a short space of time, it#s quite remarkable. But there#s still a lot more to find out.We know the virus does not have the ability to mutate in the way influenza changes. It#s not as dramatic as that, but this is still a new virus as it#s only been around for a few months. We still don#t know what it will look like in one or two years# time. That#s an issue to begin with.The simplest way to imagine Covid- is as a tiny tennis ball with #spikes# around the surface, which are formed by proteins.Those spikes interact with another protein on the surface of the human cell called the ACE  Receptor.The spikes help the virus to roll along the cell until it comes across this receptor.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan Power FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMolecular virology professor Dr Ultan PowerThe ACE  Receptor is the lock, the spike protein is the key. Connection allows the virus to enter the cell using viral RNA, and that is the most important part of the virus. It effectively acts like a photocopier.RNA manages how the other parts of the cell . When the virus RNA gets into the cell, it reassigns everything to one job - make more virus particles.Instead of the cell doing things to keep our bodies working efficiently, it focuses on making viruses. One gets in, thousands of virus particles come out. They infect other cells, and eventually other people. That process happens over and over again, and very suddenly - in just a few weeks - you have a global pandemic.No one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wandThe human immune system reacts to defend the body, but for some people the immune system is overwhelmed. Overactive, it causes damage to tissue and organs. Lungs may be unable to operate. The weaker the immune system in a person, the more likely serious damage is caused, hence the shielding of those most vulnerable in our society.A lot of the drugs - antivirals - being trialled and tested across the world are trying to stop this viral replication.A vaccine is seen as the game-changer, the route back to the world we knew.Vaccines teach your immune system how to create antibodies that protect you from diseases.Having a vaccine also benefits the whole community through herd immunity.If enough people are vaccinated, it is harder for the disease to spread to those people who cannot have vaccines.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDr Anthony FauciAFP via Getty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDr Anthony FauciAnthony Fauci, the face of America#s fight against coronavirus, believes a vaccine may be ready in  to  months.It sounds a long time, but history shows it really isn#t.Fauci#s timeline would shatter all precedents for developing a new vaccine, which can take many years. The fastest vaccine was for mumps, and took four years.Optimism about an Aids vaccine was once high, but  years later we still wait.Dr Power added: Unfortunately, no one is going to be sitting in a laboratory and waving a magic wand and suddenly saying there#s your vaccine. It#s a much more complicated process than that.There are around  vaccines in clinic at the minute, most of them targeting the #spike# protein, which latches itself on to the cells.If that can be nulled then the virus can#t latch onto the cells and cannot become active and infect.But there#s no one definitive process on how to develop the vaccine in the first place, and that#s before you get to the testing stage.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Selfish party-goers will en the time coronavirus lockdown restrictions remain for all of us in Northern IrelandSome of the candidate vaccines involve hugely weakening the virus, before putting it into the body. The idea is to stimulate the immune system to create enough of the right type of antibodies to be ready to fight the real thing. Others involve finding a way to get a virus particle that our systems can easily fight off, and get that to carry the spike protein from SARS-CoV, the virus that causes Covid-. The idea being our cells which make antibodies will learn to recognise the shape of the spike protein, and be ready to stop it entering the ACE- receptorwhen it arrives on the real virus particle. At Oxford University Irish Professor Adrian Hill is heading a team using this method, the current leaders in the race to develop a vaccine to stop the virus.And a final truly modern method is being worked on by several companies, including US-based Moderna. It involves cutting up the RNA of the virus, effectively clipping up the page before it is put into the photocopier. The aim of this is to isolate the bit of the virus RNA that makes the spike protein, and get that into our cells. Our cell machinery will then #photocopy# the spike protein, but never see the rest of the virus particle. Those spikes will be recognised by the immune system, which will make antibodies, ready for a time when the spikes arrive on the virus particle. These are known as RNA vaccines, and many experts believe they will be key to fighting infectious diseases in the years to come, but the technology to produce them has only become viable in the last few years, and none have yet been rolled out. You must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage.Once approved, they would be very quick to produce, but testing of such designs - and all designs - would be crucial. Dr Power explained: It#s very dficult to say what the best method is and the construction of the vaccine is critical.And we have to remember our primary targets are the elderly and they are much more dficult to vaccinate than younger people as their immune system is weaker.But once the method of production of the virus is settled, the next step is to scale up to a level where you can produce millions of doses.Then it#s a case of repetitive testing through several phases, with safety the main issue throughout the whole process.With pre-clinic trials, perhaps involving mice, you allow the virus effect to be minimal but we can determine the capability of immune response toxicity levels, whether the vaccine does too much damage to be useful.If the vaccine gets through that stage, then it is on to testing in a clinic. But, as Dr Power explains, many hurdles still lie ahead.He added: Safety is again the key, making sure there are no problems caused, watching the consequences and toxicity levels. Any signs of toxicity and a decision will have to be made on whether to progress to the next phase.That#s when you introduce the vaccine to a series of trials with a limited number of subjects, again ensuring safety all the way through. You look for dose effects, how much of the potential vaccine produces the best results. Then you select the dose to proceed with to another stage.Using a much greater number of people, perhaps thousands, there must be a robust response. If everything comes together and the vaccine still produces positive results then the steps to authorise can start. A decision will be made whether to manufacture or not and all the details in the dossier will be looked at before a licence to produce is granted.By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.It all sounds like a lot of work, and it is.With this pandemic there is a lot more pressure to produce and there#s a temptation to relax a little in terms of vigilance, said Dr Power.But you must be sure any vaccine will not cause more damage. Normally the whole process takes around  years.I spent nine years working on a vaccine and it fell at the third stage. It#s not easy, there#s a lot that can go wrong. And eventhe vaccine does work, can we be sure it will still work in a year#s time You normally need at least a year to monitor that, take time to draw breath and then move to the next step. If there#s anything viable within the next  months we#re talking about history book stuff. By the end of this year we might have a candidate, but it#s too critical to rush through.There can then still be issueany vaccine is brought to market, Dr Power explains.Read More This has been #worst event to hit us in  years, even after two recessions,# says NI business ownerProblems can develop, a one in a million reaction can be missed.He added: It#s wonderful to see the aspiration to produce a vaccine for Covid-, but the pressure of your country is not what you want on your shoulders, especiallythings go wrong down the line.We all want this so badly there#s a real danger of problems. We have to work out which specic people have a bad reaction - that#s normal with any vaccine.There#s a risk with everything and those risks will be found out in trying to gain approval to bring to market.The risks must be balanced. Those people who have a reaction will then not be given the vaccine and the theory is that herd immunity protects them. The virus struggles to find those without vaccination. The majority protect the few.He added: But in everything we do we can#t lose sight of the fact that we must always follow the data. That takes a considerable amount of time.

Picture by Frank McGrathCatherine FeganMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMiguel Plangca was  when he left his home in Ozamis city in the Philippines for a new le in Ireland.Like many Filipinos who relocate to the Republic, he had come for employment and managed to secure a job in Naas with Green Isle, one of the country#s biggest frozen food producers.For the next  years he did little  but work, clocking up thousands of gruelling hours on the factory packaging line and sending money home to his we Gilceria and his five children in the Philippines.When Gilceria died from cancer in , his heartbroken children came to live with him in Naas, Co Kildare.Last week, tragedy struck the Plangca children once again when Miguelsuccumbed to the coronavirus.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us Mikee PlangcaIt came as such a shock, his -year-old daughter Mikee told the Irish Independent.Dad had been sick for about a week in the house, with a cough and what he thought was a cold and then he ended up in ICU. He spent  days there before he died. It#s very hard for us to take it all in at the minute.Together with her siblings Michael , Johnand Chekie , Mikee is now an orphan.I#m concentrating on minding my brothers and sisters for now, she said.We don#t know what will happen. We would like to stay in Ireland because that#s where we have made a le, where our friends are and our [Filipino] community is, but we don#t know.The Plangca children first arrived in Ireland four years ago. Until then, they had lived their lives in the Philippines, where their only contact with their father was through video calls and twice-yearly visits.Their half-sister Stephanie, a daughter Miguel had from a previous relationship, was living in Abu Dhabi.My father made a decision many years ago to come here to provide for us, said Mikee. holds a photograph of her father Miguel who was a factory worker and lost his le to Covid-, leaving Mikee and her  siblings orphans.

Picture by Frank McGrathHe left so we could stay in the Philippines and have a better quality of le. Every month he sent money home to us.We were like many other families in the Philippines who had a parent in another country working to provide.Then when my mother died, we came here to Ireland to live with him.After completing sixth year at school in Prosperous, Co Kildare, Mikee opted out of going to college.Instead, she applied to be a full-time carer for her brother Michael, who has intellectual disabilities.My brother is my responsibility, said Mikee.When we first came to Ireland, Dad was working day shts but he switched to night shts so that I could go to school. He looked after Michael during the day and worked at night.My Dad made so many sacrices for us. He was a good man and everything he did he did for us.Meanwhile, Miguel#s sister Fely had followed in her brother#s footsteps by moving to Ireland herself in .She later married an Irish man and settled in Naas, where she works as a childminder.I was working in the Philippines, not earning a lot of money and my brother encouraged me to come here, she said. I met an Irish man and got married and I made a le here too.When Gilceria died and the children came here Miguel was finding it dficult to cope on his own and he talked about moving back to the Philippines. I said no, you can do this, so they moved in.My husband said to bring them in to live with us and that#s where they were living when this all happened.After Miguel fell ill with Covid-, Fely also contracted the virus.We were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong Miguel#s sister, Fely Miguel was hospitalised on April  and Fely joined him in Naas General hospital six days later. When Miguel#s children were tested, Mikee and Michael were found to be Covid positive.Michael and I had no symptoms, said Mikee. We self-isolated in the house for a month. We were too scared to go out.Fely was discharged on April , but her brother#s condition worsened.My mother and siblings would call him every night at six o#clock, she said.They would talk to him in his hospital bed and we were all praying he would get better. In the end it was no good, the virus was too strong.Last year, the Green Isle pizza manufacturing site in Naas where Miguel worked was bought over by Birdseye.Colleagues remember him as a kind and gentle colleague. When he became ill, the Filipino community stepped in to look after his young family.We had to try to help out as best we could, said Aina Conway, president of the Kildare Filipino Community.They have recovered but they have lost their father and they are in shock. I speak to Mikee most days and she has cried every day since her father was brought in to ICU. At the moment she is just trying to be strong for the little ones.Together with the Philippine consulate, the Kildare Filipino Community are raising money in aid of the Plangca children.They have their aunt, but Mikee has been the mum for a long time, said Aina.Now that they have lost their father, they need all the support we can give them. Miguel came here to provide a better le for his children. You look at the kids now and that#s them forever, with no parents. It#s incredibly sad.

The parish priest could be seen using a device to line-up the music, but immediately looked confused when the famous Orange Order song began playing - giving his parishioners at home a bit of a giggle at the end of the Mass. While Fr Jimmy declined to comment on the incident when contacted by the Belfastlast night, he dealt with it at the time in good-natured humour. A priest in Lisnaskea had the wrong playlist lined up for his ending of mass hymn on Sunday. He mistakenly played the sash at the end of mass. Fr Jimmy apologises by saying âsorry I picked the wrong one, sorry about that, itâs a bit early for that isnât itâ. pic JDrFqZNK— Brendan MarshallMay , Quick as a flash, just as the The Sash began playing throughout the empty church, he told his online congregation: Sorry, that#s the wrong one. Sorry about that. And in a nod to the fact that it wasn#t The Twelfth of July just yet, he added: It#s a bit early for that, isn#t it . Unfazed, the priest quickly restored order and played the track he had originally intended to - Footprints In The Sand by Leona Lewis. Footage of the faux pas at the altar has been widely shared and viewed on social media. One person wrote: Oh Bless him.

Tuesday saw the ninth edition of the County Derry Post without a match report, without an athletics update and without any kind of preview. Getting bogged down in feature and nostalgia pieces gives sports journalists the opportunity to chat with characters and legends from yesteryear. It is the perfect therapy. Living and working in isolation, is just how le is at the moment. You appreciate a daily run and the chirping birds all the more. Every day seems the same, but some things are dotted in to keep the week structured. googletag.cmd.push Joe McCloskey hosts a zoom quiz for our circle of friends, so that means it is Saturday at .pm. Fr Doherty delivers mass via the webcam, so that means it is Sunday morning at . and proofing pages means it is Monday and deadline time. Our daughter Erins school, St Brigids   Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted in Tirkane, have been excellent at rolling out enough work to keep her engaged. I play Muacuteinteoir Daidaiacute and set out a few tasks. Not a lot, but just enough to maintain some sort of structure. There is so much out there that is learning, the practical stuff. My we Pauline took her on a nature walk to pick wild flowers for a May altar. Granny Sally is teaching her how to grow tomatoes and the treehouse, crafted by Granda Mickey, is getting well tested. And all the teddies made an appearance in the garden to make a zoo, as shown in the picture above. googletag.cmd.push It is just great to be able to spend time with your family. Then one evening came a statement that just stopped me in my tracks. “Daddy, when this is all over, can we go to that Kitchen place in Magherafelt for a chocolate milkshake,” Erin asked. Her this is the coronavirus and she is talking about Shorty McNallyscafe, a hub of chat. Erin always get a milkshake and I get the half and half with chicken curry that always hits the spot. Erin follows up: “Daddy...when will this all be over ” “I dont know pet,” comes my answer. And I dont. I feel tiny and helpless. At this stage, the penny drops. What must be going on in their wee heads  The schoolwork is irrelevant. They will all catch-up sometime. A cuddle and some reassurance that you are there for them is more important. Every Thursday night, a round of applause is dedicated to those working in the NHS and on front line. But me, my thoughts are also dedicated to the children out there. They have also been thrust into a whole world of uncertainty. God love them. One thing is certain though...Shortys next serving of milkshake and curry will never taste better.

Councillors on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were asked to attend the meeting using video conferencing software after the cancellation of meetings during April and March. Cllr Kathleen McGurk said it was important that the council were in a position to adapt to the circumstances of the pandemic. She said: “It is vital that democratic accountability and protection for ratepayers continues during the pandemic. “This is a crucial period for our ratepayers, families, businesses, employees and they will be depending on council to continue to provide service delivery and assist our community to get through this crisis. googletag.cmd.push “Council meetings are a vital part of that and I would expect them and other meetings to be held online now for the foreseeable future.” While there were some minor technical issues, the meeting mostly passed off successfully and there is hope that the public and press will be able to attend future meetings. Cllr McGurk said: “I would hope that this will ensure future meetings will be even more open and transparent. “This may even encourage greater access with members of the public who would never normally have attended a council meeting able to view meetings online from the comfort of their home. googletag.cmd.push “This can only be a good thing for democracy and allow the public a greater insight into the workings of decision-making bodies. “Tuesday’s online meeting of council is proof that we can adapt to work around some of the problems presented by coronavirus. “This crisis has pushed all sections of society to find technological solutions to the way we work and I firmly believe that the lessons learned from this will have a long term impact on how we continue to work after the pandemic has passed.” Details of future meetings to be held remotely will be published on the council’s website.

Speaking at the Executives daily COVID- press conference, she said: Churches and places of worship can reopen their doors for acts of inidual prayer provided they adhere to all of the social distancing and public hygiene requirements over this last few weeks in what has been a very testing time for our people. People of all faiths have turned to prayer in their homes and have used ious digital s to stream religious services. So the decision to open religious venues for prayer has been deemed sufficiently low risk in terms of COVID-. googletag.cmd.push But we do urge those who are availing of this service to exercise common sense. Expanding those relaxations to include religious services will be kept under review. Drive in religious services will be permitted provided people remain in their cars, the First Minister said, and the proper social distancing advice is followed. Deputy First Minister Michelle ONeill said you can meet in groups of up to six people outdoors, take part in outdoor activities such as golf and fishing and attend drive in performances such as music and theatre. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

TheNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject has  members across Derry and Strabane who have formed ayouthcouncil and are currently putting together a manesto for change. The cross border and cross community project is for young people aged  to  and allows them to be the voice for the young people in theNorthWest. It normally includes residential and activity based work, study visits, local workshops, confidence building and skills development. However, these were all cancelled due to the lockdown. Project Manager of theNorthWestMinistryofYou thProject , Barry Fennell, decided to use video conferencing technology to allow the group to continue to come together and share ideas. googletag.cmd.push TheTheNorthWestMinistry ofYouthhas successfully managed to harness the new technology to continue their work and has now set up a series of sub committees to look at employability, learning, health, sport and the environment. As the project progresses the group will put together a youth manesto which will lay out the changes they would like to see in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area. Mr Fennell said the group have adapted remarkably well to the changes in their circumstances. They have been brilliant in terms of their ability to continue and they are very switchedon. We are still having our weekly meetings through Zoom and that allows us to keep those connections at this time and try and continue with this project as well. googletag.cmd.push Co-chair of the group Plunkett Roarty, who is in Year  at Lumen Christi College, said video conferencing is the next best thing to meeting face to face. Due to the coronaviruscrisis we have had to use resources such as Zoom to stay in contact and come together to share ideas and tackle the key issues, he said. Plunkett is part of the Department for Health and Well-being which is tackling issues such as mental health and positive body image. At the minute we are at the discussion stage aboutplans and initiatives to tackle that, he explained. Video conferencing is a useful tool and we are still able to get a lot done. The members of the group are also enjoying the chance to socialise online. With school being off and all my sports training being cancelled the Zoom meetings area chance to meet up and see familiar faces who are facing the same issues as you, said Plunkett.North West Ministry of Youth – Youth Voices Project is delivered by Co-operation Ireland and Education Authority. This opportunity is funded by the EU’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body. Match-funding has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.

Derry  Strabane People Before Profit Cllrs Eamonn McCann and Shaun Harkin said: People Before Profit joins other parties in welcoming the announcement that the Stormont Executive has approved a graduate-entry Medical School at Magee.We take this as a down-payment on the first instalment of what Stormont owes to the working-class people of the North West.Every place in the proposed medical school will be a boost for Derry - and will whet Derry’s appetite for delivery of the rest of what’s been promised.However, we mustn’t allow approval of the medical school to ert attention from the target agreed by all parties of , extra full-time student places. Approval of the medical school cannot be a substitute for expansion of third-level education generally. We wont be settling for  additional students a year when the numbers have been cut by hundreds in recent years.The embarrassing scramble for political credit for getting the medical school approved is in full swing. The fact is that every party in the North West with elected representatives has fully supported the medical school. The task now is not to demand a share of success but to recognise how far short this falls from what Derry has demanded down through the years.And we must keep in mind that all that we have so far is the promise. It is not cynical, particularly not in Derry, to say that we’ll fully believe it when we clearly see it. googletag.cmd.push And questions still remain about who will deliver third-level education provision here. The institution with that responsibility doesnt have the trust of those whove witnessed its deliberate policy of downgrading Derry for decades.It was possible to believe for  years that the reason Derry had been cheated of third-level education was that sectarian unionism didn’t want proper development of gerrymandered Derry. But that explanation won’t wash now.In the last  years, Derry has had Deputy First Ministers, Ministers for Finance, Ministers for Education etc. - all from a nationalist background. Those establishment parties have systematically let the people of Derry and the North West down and delivery of the medical school wont make up for their failures.We shouldn’t stop to savour this interim success, but rather take it as encouragement to push on towards full delivery of Derry’s entitlement. We will continue on our present path, working with other parties and campaign groups, including trades unions and student unions, to bring this saga to success at last. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

The -plus-style exams are due to ahead in November and December, two weeks later than planned. However, given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been calls for the organisations that run the tests to call them off. In his role as Apostolic Administrator for the Diocese of Dromore, Archbishop Eamon Martin has written a letter making the same appeal to Catholic schools in that diocesan area. The Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown, has sent a similar letter to grammar schools in the city in his role as a trustee of Catholic schools in his diocese. googletag.cmd.push In a letter to school principals and governors, Archbishop Martin, a former President of St Columbs College in Derry, said he was aware that anxiety was building. He said parents and teachers had shared their disquiet and uncertainty that was already upsetting some children. I know that teachers have been providing helpful study packs and online resources to assist with home schooling. Parents are doing their best to respond, while juggling work and home commitments, and in some cases overseeing learning for several children at once. Some pupils are responding well others are struggling, without ready access to technology or the one-to-one assistance of their teachers. googletag.cmd.push A school principal observed to me that he anticipates educational disadvantage will be exacerbated given this years special circumstances. There was a likelihood of children ing to school in phases in September, he added, and pupils may require additional emotional support. With this in mind, and in the best interests of our children and schools, I appeal to the whole educational community to support a suspension of the use of academic selection for entrance to post-primary schools in , he added. I urge the boards of governors to publish admissions criteria which do not rely on the use of transfer tests carried out under such uncertain and challenging circumstances. Archbishop Martin added: In making this appeal for a suspension of the use of academic selection in the coming year, I have no desire to simply re-open the arguments for, and against, the transfer tests. I make this call from my heart on behalf of the current Primary Six children, their families and all our school communities, he concluded. In his letter, Bishop Donal McKeown said that socially disadvantaged pupils would be seriously disadvantaged in the transfer tests as they would have been out of school for almost six months. Therefore, in the interest of fairness to pupils and in the interest of maintaining a mix of pupils in the school community, I would ask your board of governors to consider how you could respond to this, he wrote. This may well be a situation where criteria other than transfer test grades should be included for at least a substantial proportion of the  entry cohort.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

Its a cycling pandemic, joked Brian Cassidy of Claudy Cycles, who hasnt seen demand like this during his  years in business. First it was toilet roll and now its bicycles. I have had people queuing right out to the gate and people haveactually texted me thinking there was a wake going on because they saw all the cars parked on the road. Groups of cyclists have become a familiar sight across the city as people take advantage of their daily exercise allowance to get out and about on two wheels. googletag.cmd.push The country is going mad for bikes, said Mr Cassidy, who is working from am until pm at night delivering and repairing them. Everybody is on furlough and once they got their new fences built and painted they all wanted a bike. With manufacturing halted in China due to the globalpandemic, bike supplies have dried up and Mr Cassidy estimates it could be up to two weeks beforehe has them in stock again. Theres not a bike to be got at the minute, he said. I was selling bikes to people as far away as Sligo and people were buying them after only seeing a picture on WhatsApp. googletag.cmd.push Mr Cassidy has also seen a huge upsurge in repairs as people across Derry pull their neglectedbikes out of attics and garden sheds. People are digging up these old relics to be fixed, he laughed. Ive been surprised with some of the things people are bringing to me and of course they all want them done today. Will Ennett from the Northland Road has been getting out and about on his new bike during lockdown, which has a specially built trailer for his two kids Rose, , and Johnny, . The children love the novelty of it and wehave been discovering lots of new places like Ebrington Square and the old railway line at the Foyle Road, he said. Its a new hobby and something I plan to keep up once lockdown is over. Halfords has also seen a surge in bike orders at itsCrescent Link store which is currently closedto the public, but is offering a click and collect service. If you were looking for a bike today you would struggle to find one that is in stock, said storemanager, Colm Shiels. We get three deliveries a week and they come in the back door and we build them and then they are going out the front door to customers. We have been flat out, its been like Christmas. So what is the appeal of cycling during lockdown  People love the freedom to get out and about, Mr Shiels explained. The gyms and swimming pools are closed so people who are used to daily exercise are having to think of dferent ways to do it. For some people cycling is a way to justy some bad habits they might have taken up duringlockdown. Businesshas also gone through the roof for Bee Cycles repair service. A spokesperson for Bees Cycles said they were strugglingto cope with demand. It feels like we are busy  , there had never been anything like it before. It has been hard to keep up with demand but its great to see. News of the massive increase in the sale of bikes in Derry comes just days after plans were announced to create a new Cycling Champion role in the city. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said earlier this month that she wants to appoint a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support our new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better. “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mr McFadden said that the necessary work was done to ensure that the first students can start at the medical school next year. “Everything must now be done to ensure the school is open and ready for its first intake of students in September . googletag.cmd.push The Covid- emergency has highlighted the importance of our health service.

South Derry film fans’ closest venues under the initial plan would have been Derry city, Portrush and Antrim, but plans are currently underway to bring the tour to Cookstown and Dungannon. Conor Moran, from The Big Drive Inn, told the County Derry Post that they hope to show four dferent screenings per day. He said: “We use an LED screen and the brightness is a lot sharper than a projector. Our movies can run from  o’clock in the day til  o’clock at night. googletag.cmd.push “In the afternoon, at pm and pm, we will be showing more family-orientated films. At pm, we’ll show a classic film and at pm a blockbuster. “The plan is to do this as a tour of Northern Ireland and keep it going as long as Covid- lasts.” The company had already begun to tour in the Republic of Ireland before it was placed into lockdown, with shows in Dundalk and Cavan, and are now resuming plans to move north. In keeping with strict hygiene guidelines, the organisers say they will be taking all necessary precautions and implementing social distancing. “We encourage arriving in, staying in and leaving in your car so it’s complete family isolation,” said Conor. googletag.cmd.push “Toilets will be provided, we provide portaloos. Your temperature is taken on entering the toilet by an automated temperature taker. “If your temperature is too high you wouldn’t be able to enter the toilet. All toilets are sanitised and there is state-of-the-art technology checking temperatures. “All toilets are sanitised after each use. There will be sanitisers on site as well and we’ll be encouraging people to sanitise. “We have a host of other processes in place to protect against Covid-. All transactions are cashless, so you buy your ticket online. “We won’t be offering any food yet, until the lockdown eases. If that’s during the tour, we’ll look at doing some food, but for the first few events, we’ll be encouraging people to bring their own. “All our staff members have undergone safety training to ensure we promote and enforce a safe event for all.” If the tour proves to be a success, the organisers have said they may look at continuing the service after the Covid- restrictions have been eased. “We hope to continue with it after the lockdown. It will be almost a funfair operation, staying in each venue for two days. “All of our screens are on trailers and we have four smaller trailers that are shown throughout the car park.” Conor does not foresee any issues in having to enforce social distancing but have insisted that they have a security team in place to deal with those who aren’t complying. “We did it just before the lockdown in the south and to be honest, people don’t want to leave their cars,” he said. “We had hundreds of cars and had no hassle. People are excited to see the film. If they do, we’ll ask them to leave the car park and we have staff in place for that.” More details can be found on the Big Drive-Inn Facebook page.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone.

The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme.

This gaming  is an ever developing technology that makes training a lot more bearable and safer during those cold dark winter nights.With Zwt providing social rides, workouts, structured programmes and competitive racing, it has something for every cyclist mdash and, recently, runners too mdash all from the comfort of your home.So obviously when socialdistancing and lockdown struck, the footfall on Zwt rocketed. I suddenly noticed Shimna Wheelers numbers were increasing, from three or four of us to over a dozen.All were using it for dferent reasons. Alex McMath, Ronan Kelly, Jimmy McVeigh and myself were trying to maintain fitness and, with the aid of other apps, to socialise while riding and basically enabling a virtual club ride during lockdown. To fit in with family le these normally occur early morning or late evening.Along with Kieran Connolly, Brian McLornan and Andrew Porter, we are involved in racing leagues organised by Newry Wheelers and Cycling Ireland. The Cycling Ireland league races are broadcast live on Saturday mornings on YouTube.On the racing side, there has been plenty of banter between club members regarding weight and power. The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. For Gerry, this was his sole success in the saddle.The third race of the day was the Rearsquos Emporium Open which resulted in another nice local success for Nightmaster, owned and trained at Erenagh by John McCauley and ridden by his son Denis.David Wilsonrsquos Wremando, ridden by Laurence Millar, was second and third past the judge, David Shillington, from Dromara, was Blinky Bill in the colours of Comberrsquos Dessie Osborne, the former good amateur Paul Larkin being in the saddle.On the days leading up to this meeting, the dogs were barking, as they say, for a horse called Supplementary Sam. This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley. Frankie Fitzsimons was fourth on Davy Blackrsquos Anns Penny.The winner, making his debut, ran in the colours of Rathfrilandrsquos Sam McKee, better known as Uel, who told me not all that long ago, that they arrived at the track that day in a makesht horse box and parked beside some of the lorries from top stables.The East DownshireOpen Farmers Race went to Grange Valleyrsquo, owned and trained by former good amateur Ballymenarsquos Samy Patton and ridden by Robert Steele, who rode all his runners. Second was Ballymoney farrier John Mawhinneyrsquos Motalee, ridden by Denis Macauley who in later years bred Brave Inca. Strahane Last took third ahead of False Modesy, ridden by Ballygowanrsquos I Kerr for Tom Kerr.This was double success for Lisburn vet-surgeon Robert Steele, as he had earlier won the second race of the day, the R E Hamilton Hunter Chase Championship Qualier, value pound, on Eurowin. Second was Meadow Hawk, ridden by William Gault, from Randalstown, with Downpatrickrsquos painter Kieran McLoughin third on the Leo McGrady-owned Le Bambino.Irsquom not sure where I watched all the races, but I do recall that I went to the second fence on the course to watch the final race, the Ashley Bar Mares Maiden Race. In those days the fence was an open ditch and permanent.The leader going into the fence was Miss Alex, trained by Victor Robinson at Portadown and ridden by Tom Howley. The six year old never lted, firing her rider onto the ground, and in the process brought down Colin McBratney on More Cloud. Somehow the other  runners avoided Howley as the race progressed.The eventual winner was Bonnetys Bridge, a rare ride and a sole career win for Don Ferris from Poyntzpass, Newry, who is now the father-in-law of top local amateur Mark OrsquoHare. Second past the post was Dalaray, owned by Banbridge farmer Robert Mulligan and the mount of Ian Buchanan, who was a dentist in those days. Third was Staboe Lady, ridden by her owner, M CampbellThe meeting was run under the stewardship of Craig Caven and Mrs Doreen Johnston. The hon secretary was Ballydrainrsquos Jim Pooler, while his son, Chris, was the announcer. The clerks of the course were Denis Macauley and Tom Edgar and among the honorary surgeons was Mr Alan Archbold from Seaforde. In those days Billy Cromie from Clough was well known as the board marker.Among the advertisers were Charles Keown, Renault dealer Royal Ascot Roadhouse, Carryduff Seaforde Transport CJ Foy MPS, Irish Street, Downpatrick The Old Tom Bar, Castlewellan Watt and McBriar Ltd, Saintfield Abbey Grill, Downpatrick and Irwinrsquos Superfoods, Ballynahinch.Following on from the only career wins of Lavery and Ferris, it is interesting to record that in  Craig Caven, Ardglass farmer and long time master of the East Downs, was able to achieve a long held ambition to ride in a point-to-point when partnering Nightmasterrsquo, a course specialist owned and trained by John Macauley, in the opening Alan Dunlop Confined Hunt Race.It was a very wet and windy day mdash only eight of the  entries took part mdash but Craig won from ldquoTullumgrange, bred and owned by Ardglass farmer Dick McConvey, and ridden by Darragh Cross rider Paul McMahon. Red Gazette, owned by Frances Haw from Ballynahinch, came third.Felix Burns, who is now over , from Rossglass, had a runner in the race called Bright Spree VI.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants. Sometimes you would see all kinds of fish, jelly fish, and ious types of seals and whales.ldquoYou could be washing the dishes and see a humpback whales outside. It was just ridiculous but absolutely wonderful at the same time.Spending Christmas at Port Lockroy was also special to Kit and the team as they had the pleasure of a day off and a chance of seeing the tiny island from a dferent perspective.Kit said: ldquoThere was a cruise ship nearby who kindly offered us a couple of kayaks. We manged to kayak around the island on Christmas day which was a great experience.While hersquos happy to be home with his family mdash dad Colin, mum Janette and brother Nick , who is also back home having left his former job in the Swiss Alps mdash Antarctica still has its hold over Kit.ldquoSimply being there is something that I do miss but the people I was there with were truly wonderful and I got on fantastically well with them, he says. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange being with them for so long and then everyone just goes their separate ways.ldquoEverything is up in the air at the moment but I really would love to go back..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Soccer.jpg","title":"Soccer over  ","story":"THE local soccer season has come to an end with unfinished business left on the books.Amateur League and Newcastle League officials have brought their seasons to a juddering halt without promotion and relegation issues being decided.Both leagues made their decisions after consulting with their clubs and although no one goes up and no one goes down, there are clear winners and losers.In the Amateur League the biggest losers are Ballynahinch Olympic, who were bidding to become champions of the Premier Division for the first time.They had an eight-point lead at the top of the table when football was suspended two months ago, although nearest rivals Crumlin Star and East Belfast had plenty of games in hand.Also on the losersrsquo list are Dromara Village, who were lying third in Division A and vying for promotion to the top flight.The biggest winners are Drumaness Mills, who have been spared relegation from the Premier Division, despite being rock bottom without a point to their name.Also saved are Downpatrick FC, who were eight points adrt at the bottom of Division A, and Ballynahinch United, who were at the foot of Division A and odds-on to make the .The only section to have an outcome is in Division C where top of the table Rosemount have been promoted.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months.

He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews.

While many all ability schools are of course excellent, those best performing Catholic schools would neverto such heights without a selective intake.That, while a great pity, would ultimately be a matter for the Catholic education sector. If grammar schools as a whole disappear, however, then NI will become like England: selection will be based on wealth, not on any semblance of merit.Academic selection, for all its imperfections, is vastly preferable to a wealth based system. The ruling class in the UK is now dominated by ex public school pupils, because of the disastrous consequences of abolishing grammar schools.Yet the campaign to dismantle NI’s grammars is relentless, evenoften below the radar. Any attempt to move to teacher assessment, for example, could lead to major iations in standards and so to injustices for unfairly assessed pupils. It would be one day be followed by a demand that all selection is abolished, which would be a huge and retrograde step.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

COVID- emergency funding for local councils.By The NewsroomTuesday, th May , : pm\"\"This morningCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, informed the Assembly that the Executive had agreed to provide a total of £. million to NorthernIreland’s  councils by way of an “immediate intervention”.Speaking after the announcement was made, ABC Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell said: “As a Council it is our priority during this crisis to protect and ensure the delivery of our basic services but like many other councils at this time, the future of these essential services such as bin collections, burials and street cleansing are threatened by loss of income“I therefore welcome this announcement of funding, which will provide some interim assistance from now until the end of June.”Editorial Image. : Other rd PartyCommunities Minister, Deirdre Hargey MLA said: “Despite the current COVID- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in deliveringpublic services, such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemeteryservices.“The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring out health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities.“This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time.“It will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.”While the additional funding is welcomed, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council’s Lord Mayor said more will need to be done to ensure council’s can help communities to recover.“It is a first step but it is clear that further investment in local government will be required to ensure that Council are not only in a position to provide continuity of service to our ratepayers but that we are able to help our communities recover,” said the Lord Mayor.“The executive must look at longer term investment to support the financial resilience of our councils so that we are resourced to deliver on strategies for bespoke economic recovery and community support.“Councils will be in the frontline of transformation post COVID- and it is a priority that we are equipped to deal with the signicant body of work ahead.“Meanwhile a spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council said Council will continue to ensure vital public services are protected.“Council welcomes the announcement by Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey, and will continue to work with the Minister, and colleagues across councils, to make the case for support of local government to ensure vital public services are protected,” said the spokesperson.Adam

A poundmillion rates relief package for business sectors hit hardest by the Covid- lockdown was announced by the Finance Minister Conor Murphy today. Building on the poundmillion scheme announced in March which gave all businesses a threemonth rates holiday, the new scheme will result in businesses in the following sectors being relieved of the obligation to pay rates for the full financial year up to  March : * hospitality, tourism and leisure* retail * childcare* Belfast City, Belfast International and City of Derry Airports. All businesses will also receive a one-month extension of the rates holiday up to  July . Minister Murphy confirmed: “The pandemic has had a devastating impact on the economy. The initial rates support package helped businesses with immediate cash-flow dficulties during the lockdown. As the Executive begins to ease the restrictions which have been necessary to save lives, I am pleased to announce this new scheme which importantly provides all businesses with an extended rates holiday for July. “Further support is then targeted at the sectors which will be in greatest need in the months ahead. This includes retail, hospitality, tourism, leisure, childcare and airports. This rates package, which is aligned with the Executive’s pathway to recovery, brings the total support for businesses from rates relief and grants to almost poundmillion.” Education Minister Peter Weir welcomed the Executive’s approval of an income scheme to support substitute teachers who are unable to access secure work during the Covid- shutdown of schools. With many schools closed during the pandemic except those supervising vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers, eligible substitute teachers, who were engaged between  January  to  March , will have access to an income for the period April to June . An additional income through this scheme will top up their income to at least % of that earned in the period. Minister Weir acknowledged: “I am fully aware of the signicant impact this pandemic has had on our pupils, teaching and non-teaching staff. The issue of funding for substitute teachers, who are unable to work and therefore unable to be paid, is one that and I, and my Department, have been working hard to resolve. Today, I am pleased to announce that we will be introducing an income support scheme for substitute teachers through the Covid- Response fund. The estimated total cost of the scheme is around poundmillion. My Department will allocate up to poundmillion and the Executive has agreed to fund the remaining poundmillion. I would also like to thank the Finance Minister for his support in this matter. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey announced the Executive had allocated an additional poundmillion to support the most vulnerable people in housing during the Covid- emergency. The Supporting People Programme provides housing support for approximately , vulnerable iniduals living independently including: homeless people, older people, young people, and people with physical disabilities, learning disabilities and mental health issues. The additional funds will help maintain Supporting People services, which are commissioned by the Housing Executive and delivered through the public and voluntary and community sectors. Minister Hargey explained: “The additional funding will be used to address signicant staff shortages in the immediate term and mounting pressure in this area,the number of Covid- cases continues to increase. The money will fund overtime costs for existing staff and the use of the bank or agency staffing that is necessaryservices are to be maintained. Extra cleaning is also required, and the matter of a sufficient and adequate supply of PPE is being addressed.  “These are unusual times which demand actions and solutions. This funding allocation represents our commitment to the vulnerable people in Supporting People schemes, and the staff providing support to them. We support them and we are working hard to ensure their safety and wellbeing.” The allocation was also welcomed by Health Minister Robin Swann who added: “It is well recognised that supported living services better enable people to live to their full potential and reduce the need for acute health and social care services. Their value in society cannot be underestimated. “Officials across both departments are in regular communication to identy and address Covid- priorities across our Supporting People schemes. As a result my Department has now extended Covid- testing to all staff and residents of Supporting People schemes as well as providing a temporary supply of Personal Protective Equipment.” It was revealed by Minister Hargey that local councils will also be given pound.million to alleviate financial pressures as a result of the Covid- restrictions. The funding will ensure councils can continue to provide essential services and support those in need. Minister Hargey said: “Despite the current Covid- pandemic, councils continue to play an essential role in delivering essential services such as waste collection and disposal, community support, and provision of registration and cemetery services. The restrictions that have been introduced, with the clear purpose of protecting le and ensuring our health service has not been overwhelmed, have created a severe financial challenge for our  councils as they have lost practically all of their self-generated income through the closure of council facilities. “This funding will help assist councils with their cash flow and support them in the delivery of the vital services they are providing to the community at this time but will also help ensure that they are ready to play their key role in our post-pandemic recovery and limit the financial impact on ratepayers going forward.” The Minister previously announced that councils here are eligible to apply to furlough staff through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. This will help ensure that the rights of workers are respected and jobs are protected. This scheme along with this additional funding are supporting councils through this period.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_caabcbddfae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbfaccfdefa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
