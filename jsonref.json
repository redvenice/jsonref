It will be the first time insurers are required to submit so-called living wills to the regulator.The central bank warned insurers: “We have very low tolerance for disorderly failure and its costs for policyholders and the wider economy.“We will expect firms to demonstrate that they have a suitable structure and business model, and adequate contingency plans to be able to exit the market smoothly without detriment to policyholders or spill-overs to other firms.”Banks are already required to submit living wills to the PRA to show that they could afford to foot the bill for their own failures. However, while banks’ living wills will eventually be made public, the PRA is not currently planning to release insurers’ blueprints in the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed9e7a7491c9e2aa402bf0cdc5b894ee22d77f4/0_18_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ecaba3960c41d71133445a175330849","title":"new hs2 study urges government to defer eastern leg to leeds","story":"Northern transport chiefs alarmed as infrastructure report says economy better served by improved regional connectionsThe eastern leg of the HS2 high-speed network should be deferred in favour of developing regional rail links across the north, according to a report by the UK government advisers on infrastructure.The report was met with alarm by transport authorities in the north and Midlands, who have demanded HS2 be built in full and are concerned that promises to the regions may be downgraded.The National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) said that the government should prioritise regional connections, including upgrading links between Leeds, Manchester and Sheffield and in the east Midlands, rather than completing the promised high-speed rail network link to London.Sir John Armitt, chair of the commission, said: “Major rail schemes will be an important component in levelling up the country’s economic geography, but we should ensure public money is carefully spent where it can make the most difference.“The number and scale of rail schemes currently being proposed for the north and Midlands mean that some form of prioritisation will be necessary, and we think there are ways of bringing forward benefits for communities and businesses while keeping options open for additional investments if the circumstances are right.”The report said that better regional, east-to-west rail links would provide the biggest potential improvements in productivity and connectivity for several key cities and also to a range of smaller towns. It would also improve the journeys that people are most likely to take – namely into cities from the surrounding area, rather than long-distance routes.As of March 2019, £7.4bn had been spent. Much of the work done so far has been on paper: detailed engineering designs of the length of the route, years of public consultation, and legislation. Officially launched by Labour in 2009, HS2 was reviewed and tweaked by the coalition government and\u0026nbspgreen-lighted in 2012.So far money has been spent on detailed engineering designs of the length of the route, years of public consultation, and legislation. Buying land along the route, either for direct demolition or to relieve blighted homeowners,\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccounted for a large total of the £7.4bn invested to date.In terms of physical activity, so-called preparatory works have started, although no track or tunnel has yet been built. At the southern end, HS2 has demolished housing estates, parks and office blocks around Euston, and started moving\u0026nbsptens of thousands of skeletons\u0026nbspout of the way.Train depots and industrial estates have been razed to build another HS2 station at Old Oak Common, while brownfield sites in Birmingham have been levelled for the Curzon Street station and approach. According to HS2, work has taken place at 250 sites, including\u0026nbsparchaeological digs\u0026nbspand tree planting as well as construction.The commission said its advice did not rule out further options to complete the eastern leg. The exact route is under review since Boris Johnson’s government gave the go-ahead to the full HS2 scheme in February this year, but the leg would run from Birmingham to Leeds, via Toton, in Nottinghamshire – serving Nottingham and Derby – and a link to Sheffield.The report was met with dismay in the Midlands and north, where transport planners have long argued HS2 is needed to support development.Barry White, chief executive at Transport for the North, said that while the NIC had recognised the “desperate need to better connect the north’s towns and cities”, its proposals fell short. He said: “That such investment in our rail network would also come at the expense of HS2’s long-awaited arrival to Yorkshire is a bitter blow and one we oppose. The NIC was tasked with integrating these projects – not pitching them against each other.“Constraining spending and ambition will lead to cut-price versions of the current plans and promised projects simply not being delivered.”Maria Machancoses, director of Midlands Connect, said the options put forward in the report were “very concerning”, adding: “Sacrificing parts of the high-speed network now would short-change millions of people across the Midlands … HS2 must be delivered in its entirety. To stall, scale down or delay now will cause irreparable economic damage to communities across the region.”Lilian Greenwood, MP for Nottingham South and former chair of the transport select committee, said: “This report is an insult to the people of the east Midlands, whose interests have once again been cast aside by Westminster.”Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Jim McMahon said: “If the government is serious about improving British infrastructure, supporting jobs and improving connectivity in the north it cannot now row back from building HS2 in its entirety. Recent cuts to Network Rail and failures to deliver pledged investment in the north and Midlands show the government is not keeping its promises.”However, Lord Tony Berkeley, the vice-chairman of the Oakervee review into HS2, said the report was sensible and pragmatic and welcomed it as “the first report from a government agency that challenges the runaway costs of HS2”.He said: “I do urge political leaders in the north to welcome this realistic report into the real economic and transport needs of their regions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf78147a95063911e634a5c042e965ed4ef83427/0_334_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=ba1ee77c86cb726fdd0f186108ffd1e2","title":"parents and teachers in the uk how do you feel about schools staying open ahead of christmas","story":"We’d like to hear from parents and teachers about whether schools in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland should follow Wales and switch to online learning in the run-up to ChristmasAs the Christmas holidays approach, many schools are grappling with low attendance rates and staff shortages as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

It is an effective way of getting access to other healthy iniduals. Scientists think the fungi could be producing substances that “dope” their hosts (sometimes colloquially referred to as “zombies”), meaning they can stay fresh enough to live for days after infection – only collapsing once there is nothing left in their abdomens but the fungus.“We suspect therefore that these fungi may produce amphetamine-like substances which keep a fly’s energy levels high up until the end,” said lead researcher Prof Jørgen Eilenberg from the department of plant and environmental Sciences at the University of Copenhagen. Researchers also believe the fungi produce substances that keep microorganisms away from the fly fungal wound and keep it clean, but they are yet to test this.“They work like small rockets,” said Eilenberg. “They are almost shaped like torpedoes and are designed for going fast.” If they land on another fly they stick to the cuticle and then wiggle their way into the abdomen, where they start to proliferate. Thousands of spores will be released out from a single fly.Strongwellsea tigrinae was discovered by Eilenberg in 1993 in North Zealand in eastern Denmark. Strongwellsea acerosa was first seen in a residential area in greater Copenhagen by one of his students, Dorthe Britt Tiwald, in 1998. Both have only now been officially declared new species. There are now a total of five known species of strongwellsea.Dr Matthew Kasson, an associate professor of forest pathology and mycology at West Virginia University, who was not involved in this latest research, agrees strongwellsea may be producing the same “dope” compound as massospora, which he has researched. “It’s unclear how many species we have but I really think we’ve just scratched the surface,” he says.“The reason this discovery is important is because we can’t make broad, sweeping conclusions about host manipulation and behavioural modification based on a single genus. Having a second genus like strongwellsea, which induces the same behavioural response, is important in solving this bigger puzzle of active host transmission … Collectively, this group of insect-destroying fungi may represent the next frontier for drug discovery.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3809ccea525483512c91a371899906004c22b3/0_246_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87c23858cfe1bafc1fa455336ff85886","title":"civil rights activist angela davis launches fashion collaboration renowned la","story":"Renowned LA launches ‘Heroes of Blackness’ collection with 76-year-old professor who rose to fame as a passionate campaigner for societal reformThe author, academic, former Black Panther and civil rights activist Dr Angela Davis has launched her first fashion collaboration, working with the Renowned LA label on a “Heroes of Blackness” collection which features her likeness on T-shirts and hoodies.“She had some requests,” said Renowned LA creative director John Dean, who met Davis through a mutual friend and expressed satisfaction that “she could approve of the charity and that she could approve of the design”.A portion of sales revenue from the project will go to Dream Defenders, which works towards defunding the police, and to Underground Grit, a prison reform group.Davis, now 76 and a professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz, rose to fame in the 1960s and 70s as a passionate campaigner for radical societal reform.For Dean, the collaboration with Davis comes at an important moment, as fashion brands’ commitment to ersity is being questioned. In the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May, many brands expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. More than six months later, their dedication is being questioned.The main logo on the Davis hoodie says: “We not asking no more.”The collage design also features vintage pictures of Davis alongside phrases like “black power” and “organize, unify, rebuild”.“The point behind it is that we need to create a strategy to tear down the current system and rebuild it with us in mind,” Dean said. “‘Us’ being all of us, not just a select few.”Dean said Davis was an inspiration not just as a political change-maker but as a fashion icon.“I think her silhouette is the most powerful,” he said. “If I think about the silhouette of a woman with an afro, I immediately think of Angela Davis. It’s almost like she’s a logo at this point. She’s the archetype for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9accb2b7d7a48915bb0065ec5daebb8b55d83088/0_0_5422_3615/master/5422.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e49092582bfdc5c029ce2d96f70bd0b 1400w","title":"tom cruise decadent cake christmas a list friends","story":"Rosie O’Donnell, Jimmy Fallon and Graham Norton are just a few of the famous recipients of the ‘Cruise cake’, a white chocolate coconut ring which might as well be a haloTom Cruise follows me on Twitter. Until now, I have been relatively proud of this fact, even though he follows tens of thousands of people, and only tweets three times a year, and his account is probably run by his staff, and he wouldn’t actually be able to tell you what Twitter was if you held a gun to his head. Regardless, I was proud.But now I feel like a failure, because Tom Cruise has never sent me a cake. And it turns out that all Tom Cruise does is send cakes to people. According to Yahoo, every year he orders more than 100 white chocolate coconut bundt cakes from Doan’s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California, and sends them to his famous friends. Rosie O’Donnell gets one. Kirsten Dunst gets one. Jimmy Fallon gets one. James Corden gets one. Graham Norton gets one, and his staff eat it without telling him. Henry Cavill called it “the most decadent, the most amazing cake”. Barbara Walters once ate hers live on television, in a power move as yet unmatched by any mortal human.And of course it is a good cake. Tom Cruise doesn’t operate by half measures. He thrives on intensity. He once explained how to make spaghetti carbonara to Oprah Winfrey with such ferocious conviction that I immediately started making it his way, no questions asked, in case he found out and ran to my house and kicked me in the throat. As I said, of course it’s a good cake.The Yahoo story is full of nice details. Cruise chose Doan’s as his bakery of choice because Diane Keaton bought one of its cakes to prove that it was tastier than Katie Holmes’ favourite cake. Cruise’s team takes each cake to a secondary location to be gift-wrapped before they send it out to recipients. Dunst calls it the “Cruise cake”. Despite all this, the most important thing here is the knowledge that Cruise has now officially become more legend than man.In truth, he was already well on the way. This summer, a conversation he had with culture secretary Oliver Dowden led to a Covid travel exemption so that Mission: Impossible 7 could resume production. Not long afterwards, when the rest of the world was sheltering in place, he was filming in Norway, driving a motorbike off the side of a mountain before gliding back to Earth on a parachute. Cruise has always been aggressively keen on reaching the upper levels of his capability, but this year it seems as if he’s forcing things to happen through nothing but sheer power of will.The cake thing leaves no doubt. Sending hundreds of cakes to people during a festive season so miserable that many of us have barely been able to get it together enough to write anyone a card is nothing short of miraculous. It’s as if Tom Cruise has decided that Christmas will happen and now, purely because of that, it’s happening.Yes, it’s true that he isn’t saving the world. But isn’t he sending a message to us all? If we can all go the extra mile and remember other people, and use our near-infinite wealth to direct a team of underlings to purchase, wrap and send a cake to the woman from Interview With a Vampire, then the world would undoubtedly be a better place.Was this entire piece a ploy to get Tom Cruise to send me a cake? Yes it was. Am I ashamed of that? Yes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46efa128d6a5a43aac67707896f4314e980c5912/0_0_7952_4774/master/7952.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026s=456b65453c087df86328c6a3e7e1bc30","title":"the fiver arsenal james bond","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!With games coming at Arsenal thick and fast, poor Mikel Arteta has been facing the microphones again to preview his side’s next humiliating surrender, at home to Southampton on Wednesday evening. After four defeats and a draw in their last five league matches, seven defeats this season so far, and four successive reverses at home, hacks are starting to ask if Arteta can plot a way out of their impenetrable form swamp, and among the people they are starting to ask is Arteta himself.“It’s no time to hide,” sighed the Spaniard, which sounds like a U-rated family-entertainment version of the next James Bond film. It might work, though, with Saka, Bukayo Saka, Arsenal’s No 007, setting out on a mission to find out why the older, more experienced and probably much better-paid players around him are performing so lousily despite his own heroic efforts. What skulduggery has caused these generally successful and highly-motivated iniduals to perform so inadequately? Will Q’s daring prototype Granit Xhaka pacifier work when Saka triggers the secret button embroidered on to his personalised boots? Will the English ace make it out of the club before it self-combusts completely? These questions and more will be answered in 90 minutes of high-octane action, something that can only be created at the Emirates these days with the aid of a considerable special effects budget.“It’s time to put your face and your body on the line and at the moment, I’m sorry, but we have to take the bullets,” added Arteta, clearly following The Fiver down a wacky Bond-themed mind-warren. “I have to put my chest there and you have to hit me, because you have the right to hit me because I’m not winning.

For example Edu, the club’s technical director, could only have formulated his answer with the aid of either outrageous levels of optimism or strong hallucinogenics. “Mikel is doing a great job,” he tooted. “I can see the future. I can see a big and beautiful future.” Pep Guardiola was also asked for his opinion of Arteta’s impact at Arsenal. “If I was part of the board,” he said, “I would not have any doubts about his capacity to put Arsenal in the place they deserve to be.” The most ardent Spurs fan couldn’t have put it better.Join Simon Burnton from 6pm GMT for hot MBM coverage of Wolves 2-2 Chelsea in the Premier League, before Ben Fisher guides you through Manchester City 4-1 West Brom at 8pm.David Squires on … Arsenal, Mike Dean and the general state of things amid football’s chaotic current state.

Frank Lampard’s side have lost two league matches in a row for the first time in over a year.Lampard, ever eager to deflate expectation around his lavishly assembled team, had insisted the defeat at Everton last weekend came as no great surprise, that a team in a relatively early stage of development can be forgiven the occasional lapse. The manager’s lineup did not suggest he was spooked by anything he saw at Goodison Park, as he made one alteration to the side who started there, with Christian Pulisic beginning in place of Mateo Kovacic. But too few players seemed inspired to atone too many seemed to shrink towards the end.Lampard suggested some of his players may have succumbed to complacency after enjoying a 14-match unbeaten run before losing to Everton, hinting they should reflect on their attitudes before Monday’s home game with West Ham.Nuno has been in situ at Molineux for more than twice as long as Lampard has been in charge of Chelsea but Wolves are in the throes of a transition, one complicated by the loss of Jiménez. The fact Podence and Neto attacked audaciously and scored will swell belief they can find an enduring way to win matches even without the prolific Mexican.Tthe spirit Wolves demonstrated confirmed their optimism remains high. “We knew it would be difficult and we said in the locker room that even if the game is not going well we would stay together and play as a team, and that is what we did,” Neto said.Caginess characterised a low-tempo first-half in which play from either side rarely surpassed the prosaic. Only Pulisic sparkled for Chelsea, regularly threatening down the left before tiring. When Pulisic produced a bewildering change of pace to beat Nélson Semedo and cross in the 15th minute, Timo Werner failed to apply a decisive touch from 12 yards. There has been a concerning flakiness to the German since his much-trumpeted arrival and he, like Kai Havertz and Mason Mount, struggled to exert much influence.When Werner switched flanks with Pulisic after about half an hour in a bid to contribute more, Chelsea suddenly started routing their attacks down the right. They still lacked fluency and Chelsea’s clearest chances in the first period came from corners.Giroud soared well before heading a corner by Ben Chilwell over the bar from six yards and then, just before the break, Kurt Zouma went even closer sending a powerful header against the crossbar. Giroud could not adjust quickly enough to nudge the rebound into the net.The only time Wolves worried Edouard Mendy in the first half was when Neto unloaded a volley from 20 yards after lovely work by Podence and Fabio Silva. Mendy plunged to hist right and pushed the shot out for a corner.Wolves were forced on to the back foot immediately after the break. When Werner took down a crossfield pass on the left in the 48th minute, he deftly fed the overlapping Chilwell, who pinged a cross towards the six-yard area. Giroud beat Willy Boly to the ball and swept a volley goalward, Rui Patrício unable to stop it crossing the line.That roused Wolves but it took inidual brilliance by Podence to draw them level. Collecting the ball on the left-hand side of the Chelsea box, the forward, as artful as he is fiery, fooled Chilwell with a neat twist and then tricked Reece James with a feint before lashing the ball past Mendy from 12 yards.Now Wolves scented blood. Chelsea grew weak and ragged. When Neto raced into the box and tumbled as James made to challenge him, the referee, Stuart Attwell, pointed to the spot. But after reviewing the evidence the official ruled James had not made contact with the forward.All of that became moot when Neto capped a counterattack in the dying seconds, running on to a pass by Vitinha before bursting past Zouma into the box and ramming a wonderful shot in the far corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6c2da9bde884217eddf000979a1cd3b470e2915/0_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=924205b7173ecb4b27720d62fb6222c7","title":"manchester city v west brom premier league live","story":"84 min: De Bruyne tries to scoop the ball into Aguero but Dara O’Shea, who has been brilliant in defence, is there again. Then Sawyers superbly cuts out another De Bruyne pass. City are knocking on the door. 83 min: Every West Brom player is parked behind the ball, deep inside their own half. Will City find a way through? Can West Brom hold on?80 min: City play a short corner and Matt Phillips does superbly to prevent Raheem Sterling getting a cross into the box. Phillips and Ajayi have been monstrous. Bilic is barking away, applauding his players like billy-o. Can he eke out anymore?79 min: Sawyers fouls Rodri after Ajayi plays a lazy pass into the midfielder. West Brom look mentally drained. Krovinovic is on for Livermore.76 min: Walker blasts at goal and O’Shea helps it over! You could throw a blanket over all 11 West Brom players, who are desperately trying to keep City at bay. This is excruciating from a West Brom perspective. Semi Ajayi has been a man mountain in defence. He again clears as City chuck another ball into the box.75 min: Sergio Agüero is on! Believe it or not, his last Premier League goal came in January. Phil Foden is withdrawn. Meanwhile, Benjamin Mendy is replaced by Kyle Walker. West Brom need to dig deep, that bit deeper if they can.74 min: The Livermore-Sawyers axis is simply not holding on to possession well enough. They again surrender the ball between them. Livermore looks for Austin but it is a hospital pass, really. It is going to be a long 16 minutes. Ajayi, by contrast, has been superb, so concentrated in the centre of defence.72 min: West Brom gift City the ball after some really sloppy passing 30 yards in front of their own goal. Livermore and Sawyers were guilty of not taking care of possession. In the end Conor Gallagher digs them out of trouble, thumping the ball to safety. Bilic does not look as though he can take much more of this.71 min: Austin is instantly involved, almost nicking the ball away from Rodri on halfway as the Manchester City midfielder held on to possession for a little too long. City get away with it but West Brom seem to be growing in belief.69 min: ... Rodri smashes a shot over from 25 yards! The buildup, like much of their football, was beautiful but the execution left a lot to be desired.68 min: Right on cue De Bruyne hammers a strike at Johnstone at the near post. The West Brom goalkeeper does enough. City want to crank it up ...67 min: De Bruyne is striding around midfield looking pretty miffed. Contrary to expectations, City really have not had things all their own way.65 min: City have struggled to create full stop, but have particularly struggled to carve out those City-like overloads in wide areas. Credit to Grady Diangana and Matt Phillips who have had to dig in and do the dirty work. Mendy almost got the better of Diangana a moment ago but the winger does just enough.64 min: Johnstone smothers well after Gündogan’s shot almost pinballs into the path of Jesus. The striker has had to feed off scraps.62 min: Cancelo makes a mess of a routine header and the City full-back allows Matt Phillips a sight of goal, albeit from 25 yards out. Ajayi had played a mammoth crossfield ball in search of the winger. Phillips sees the headlines and snatches at a shot from distance. It dribbles wide of Ederson’s goal.60 min: Johnstone does well to extinguish a City attack! Gündogan drives at goal, powering forward before attempting to release Jesus. But the West Brom goalkeeper is alert and snuffs it out. Can West Brom survive another half-hour?58 min: City are trying to ratchet things up, to increase the temperature. Sergio Agüero continues to warmup on the touchline.56 min: Ederson comes racing out of goal to scoop the ball up with his feet, denying Grant a chance to charge at goal and the goalkeeper kick-starts the counterattack. City win another corner but Johnstone spreads himself to deny Sterling from close range after Jesus nodded a scruffy header into his path.55 min: City go close! O’Shea recovers after allowing De Bruyne to pick his pass. City win a corner ... and Jesus plants a header on to the roof of the net!53 min: Man City skate forward with the ball after another sloppy mistake by Livermore, who again squandered possession. De Bruyne takes aim but it drops wide. Livermore then takes a few deep breaths. He needs to find a touch of composure. City are sensing blood. 52 min: West Brom clear the corner but then Livermore proceeds to gift possession back to Man City. But, fortunately for him, they fail to make the most of it. Guardiola is bouncing up and down on the touchline. He wants more heart from his team.50 min: Sterling dances along the edge of West Brom’s 18-yard box but the final pass eludes him. Sawyers does well to hoover up and extinguish any danger. Another wave of City pressure results in Foden flashing a ball across goal, and then Johnstone repels a deflected Cancelo cross. Man City get a corner.49 min: ... Dias clears the initial corner but West Brom keep it alive. They work it back into the box and Mendy was fortunate the ricochet did not drop into the path of Karlan Grant, who was lurking on the edge of the six-yard box.47 min: A hairy start to the second half for West Brom, at Sterling flicks on the afterburners. He makes a fool of Matt Phillips, who tries in vain to stay touch-tight to his man. City flash the ball into the box and Ajayi thumps clear. Meanwhile, down on the touchline, Sergio Agüero is limbering up. That’s a sight for sore eyes from a West Brom perspective. Jesus, so far tamed by Ajayi and co, has been relatively ineffective thus far.46 min: Manchester City get things started in the second half.That own goal means Manchester City’s run of more than 10 hours with conceding is over. They have not reigned supreme in defence.We’re all level at the Etihad. Ajayi pivoted and struck, via Ruben Dias, to give West Brom a whiff of the points. Gündogan gave City the lead with an incisive finish and a tonne of pressure but credit to Slaven Bilic’s side, who stuck at it. In fact, Karlan Grant should have given the visitors the lead but fluffed his lines. City have struggled to create clear-cut openings. Might we soon see Agüero?45 min: Ajayi celebrated wildly but that will likely go down as a Dias own goal. West Brom won’t care an inch. There will be one added minute.Semi Ajayi levels as City go to sleep! West Brom recycle an aimless free-kick and Ajayi pokes at goal after springing away from Ake. Replays show his shot cannons off Ruben Dias. Ederson was powerless, wrong-footed by a cruel deflection.42 min: Manchester City and West Brom were both promoted to the top flight together in 2001-02. Just let that sink in for a moment.39 min: Gallagher goes to ground to nab the ball from Jesus, and gets a booking for what was not the best challenge. He inadvertently took out team-mate Dara O’Shea too. De Bruyne sizes up the free-kick, 25 yards from goal ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f615e81af683aad7b99f15938044567df4edd0b/144_68_3554_2132/master/3554.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb75a8562e2f53c8577bfe4b6b0a4343","title":"wolves v chelsea premier league live","story":"Wolves came from behind to beat Chelsea, thanks to an excellent goal from Pedro Neto deep into stoppage timeI’m back! Just to bring you some of the thoughts of Nuno Espirito Santo, who says “today is not the moment” to talk about transfer plans for January. In other news:We reacted well. All the game I think we’re always in the game. Well organised. I think second half we played really good. I think in the first half the game was very tight, Chelsea had the ball but we were organised. We didn’t start the second half well. We conceded a goal, but the boys believed the game was there to be competitive, and we did well. We were really disappointed three days ago, football is until the last minute. It can happen to any team. We had a big disappointment against Villa and we reacted well. Now we’re going to think about the next one. It’s too bad the fans are not here to celebrate with us today.And with that, I’m off. Paul Doyle has filed his match report from Molineux, and here it is. Bye!Pedro Neto fired in a stoppage-time winning goal to crown a spectacular comeback by Wolves and inflict a punishing defeat on a Chelsea side who had briefly threatened to stumble to the top of the Premier League. After a humdrum first period Olivier Giroud opened the scoring with a beautifully taken goal, but Daniel Podence drew Wolves level with an even better one before Neto claimed a precious win for Nuno Espírito Santo’s team. Chelsea have lost consecutive league matches for the first time in over a year.Much more here:At 1-0 we should see the game out. If you’re not playing that well, which we weren’t tonight, hang on to 1-0. Control the game. Don’t allow counter-attacks. And we did. Performance. Performance is what gives you results, and we had a long run of good performances but maybe the lads think we’re playing well, and when you think you’re playing well this is what happens. He’s asked whether the six-day break that his team will enjoy before they next play will come in handy:Maybe it’s for the players to think about the game while they’re resting. Think about tonight, think about Everton. This is the Premier League and if you don’t perform, you lose games.This was a good game for technology, with both the goalline sensors and VAR being called into action and making the correct decision in a timely manner, and otherwise not bothering anybody. The match will be make for a phenomenal two-minute highlight video, featuring the penalty incident, the three excellent goals, and the wacky Kante handball thing. Kante has just had a chat with Amazon, in which he said they lost because they tried to win.We could have managed the game and keep the difference. But when they scored we tried to come back straight away, and by trying to win the game we conceded many counterattacks. What’s happened these last two games is not what we want, and we need to get back to winning ways against West Ham next game.We are very happy. We came here today, we wanted to win so much that we worked hard, and today I think we deserved victory. it’s very difficult. We knew that they are a good team but in the locker room, we said even if the game is going not so well we go together and as a team. We have done very well. We worked hard and we are very happy. 90+9 mins: And that is the final kick of the match! It was a game of two halves, one of which was excellent and the other not so much. 90+9 mins: Wolves get the ball clear, and pass to Neto on the right. Instead of taking it to the corner he attacks the goal, and very nearly scores his side’s third, but from an acute angle he lifts it over the bar!90+8 mins: Chilwell’s corner deflects behind for another, which is headed back out to him, but still he can’t nail the cross.90+8 mins: Chelsea have a corner. Mendy comes up for it!90+5 mins: Chelsea attack, and Chilwell’s deflected cross runs across the edge of the Wolves area. Two passes and a shot later Wolves have the game won. Neto is released down the inside left channel with Zouma blocking his path to goal, bursts past the defender, gets inside the penalty area and from a yard or so within it shoots low and hard across goal and into the far corner!Pedro Neto wins it with an absolute belter!90+4 mins: Nelson Semedo is booked for a foul on Pulisic.90+3 mins: Play has restarted. Wolves put together a very decent attack, at least until the cross floats into Mendy’s arms.90+1 mins: The last time Wolves had a player on the floor and holding his leg, they scored.90+1 mins: There will be five minutes of stoppage time, which start with Boly on the floor and clutching his right leg.90 mins: Podence, the home side’s outstanding player, is substituted in the final minute, Vitinha coming on. One of those substitutions that is just to give the fans an opportunity to applaud the player off the field, and the player the pleasure of soaking up their appreciation. The fans remain sadly nonexistent.89 mins: Chelsea work a good crossing opportunity for Chilwell, who miskicks badly and sends the ball looping out of play.86 mins: Neves brings down Kovacic from behind, a booking every day of the week and two on Sundays. Somehow he gets away with it.83 mins: Play restarts without a booking for Neto, who does an excellent job of pretending to be surprised and upset by the referee’s decision.82 mins: It’s easy to see why Stuart Attwell thought James had clipped Neto there, just by the way his foot landed. But there was no contact, no obstruction and no foul. Neto should be booked for his gamesmanship.81 mins: That was definitely a e, and this penalty will not stand.80 mins: Neto bursts into the area, runs between James and Kante, and goes down just inside the area. The referee points to the spot!79 mins: Kovacic came on for the extremely subdued Havertz at the same time as Abraham replaced Giroud for Chelsea.78 mins: Chance for Wolves! A good move ends with Nelson Semedo being played into space inside Chelsea’s penalty area, but instead of shooting he tries to cross to Otasowie, which was very much the wrong decision.76 mins: More Chelsea ball-handling at a throw-in. This time Chilwell tries to keep the ball from Wolves, stopping them from taking it. Podence tries to get it off him, and he rather than the game-delaying Chilwell ends up in the book, puzzlingly.74 mins: Humiliation for Kante! Chelsea win a throw-in on the left. It’s thrown to Kante, who instead of controlling it just picks it up. There’s nobody challenging him, no pressure of any sort, he just decides to catch it. Wolves have a free kick in their own half.73 mins: Traore has returned to the pitch, but it is Chelsea who look more intent on finding a winner. Twice they find lots of space on the left, but they don’t do anything much with it on either occasion.71 mins: Tammy Abraham has entered the fray, and Giroud has left it.68 mins: There will be some controversy over the goal, because the last touch as Boly’s volley deflected wide for the corner that eventually led to it was in fact off Boly himself.67 mins: Traore has done nothing in the last few minutes. He stood still throughout the attack that led to the equaliser, and is now getting some physio attention.Thiago Silva’s headed clearance is knocked down to Podence, on the left side of the penalty area, who cuts onto his right foot, shimmies to earn a bit of bonus space from James, and shoots in at the near post! 65 mins: Chance! The corner doesn’t come to much, but the ball is recyled, the cross comes in from the left and Boly’s volley deflects wide.64 mins: Traore gets up and hobbles away while Neves takes the free-kick, which flicks a Chelsea head a goes for a corner.63 mins: Traore’s first touch is followed by Giroud kicking his foot, and the Spaniard goes down awkwardly and stays there for a while.61 mins: Traore is on the pitch, and Fabio Silva has left it.60 mins: Otasowie wins the ball from Mount, who tries to pull him down by the shirt, fails, chases after him, and brings him down with an ankle-clip instead. The night’s first yellow card follows.57 mins: A good spell for Wolves, who do a bit of sustained attacking, mainly down the right. Adama Traore is preparing to join the fray.55 mins: Fabio Silva has the ball in the net, after being picked out by Neto’s pass, but he is a good yard offside and VAR is not required to disallow it.53 mins: Here is the goal for those of you who are in the right region to be allowed to watch it. And this is how far over the line the ball was when Rui Patricio punched it clear:52 mins: There was no space for Giroud there, and no time either. He had to get in front of Boly and spear the ball goalwards with his left foot, with a nonexistent margin for error. From nowhere, a breakthrough! Chelsea break, Chilwell crosses, and Giroud conjures an excellent first-time shot, which is hit close to Rui Patricio but with such power that the goalkeeper can’t stop it before it crawls over the line!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a2f574ffd8e6fe352779a9beaef434e96435340/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94498fb1b606ec58be224b236442379e","title":"portable projectors and virtual assistants six of the best gadgets to help you connect with loved ones this christmas","story":"Celebrations don’t need to be cancelled.

You plug it in to your existing router, then add one or more “satellite” stations farther away, and it connects up every inch in between. A mesh system is much more powerful than a signal booster, and the Orbi range is one of the best.

And while the easing of lockdown restrictions over the festive period means it will be possible for households to meet up for a few days in limited numbers, many are still planning for immediate-family-only celebrations. For those, Christmas 2020 is a great opportunity to shake things up and make some genuinely one-off memories by finding new ways to share the day with siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents, wherever they may be.For a start, make sure the grandparents are primed for an impromptu FaceTime, and that everyone knows how to schedule a Zoom. Hopefully, over the past year, everyone’s got the hang of “gallery view” and learned the importance of the mute button, but you might want to throw in some extra pointers for the grandparents, such as raising the screen to eye level to eradicate those huge nostrils and extra chins. It might also be wise to settle on a video calling app that all generations feel happy with – whether that’s Skype, Houseparty, Google Hangouts or WhatsApp video calls.Once everyone’s mastered it, try some tech-inspired fun and games to help you stay connected over this unprecedented Christmas period …1. Remote-binge on Christmas moviesNothing signals the start of the Christmas countdown like sitting down to watch your most loved festive film. Thanks to Netflix’s Teleparty feature, kids and grandparents can watch movies such as Arthur Christmas and The Grinch together, live chatting through the best bits. You’ll need to install the browser extension and when you start a Watch Party, others can join it using the code you send them. Get the grandparents set up beforehand to avoid any delay when the kids are poised to hit play.2. Christmas Eve-olutionLet grandparents get a taste of the excitement brewing on the evening of the 24th by scheduling a FaceTime so they can watch the kids laying out mince pies, carrots and a dram of something fortifying for Father Christmas. If they have unlimited broadband, leave it running and you could even do some cookie decorating together, or why not show them how to make some reindeer food to sprinkle outside the house (we hear muesli and glitter is Rudolph’s go-to). The joy of grandparents having this “window” into your living room is that when the hype gets too much – which it will – they can turn down the volume or simply sign off … Voilà, the perks of remote grandparenting!3. Host a special storytimeA Christmas ritual that never gets old? The annual reading of A Visit from St Nicholas (‘Twas the night before Christmas), just as the children are about to fall asleep on the 24th. For a real tradition-meets-tech moment, send the text to grandparents and schedule a candlelit Zoom for bedtime. The kids will fall asleep dreaming of Donner, Blitzen and the rest of the gang while the grandparents get to be the ones who deliver that famous sign off – “Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!” – and hopefully deal with the endless questions about when Santa is going to deliver too.4. Try a treasure huntAn online treasure hunt is a great substitute for a round of charades, especially if you pitch the kids versus the grandparents. How does it work? Simply draw up a list of festive items that you know your kids and parents will have in their houses (think: a bauble, a colourfully-wrapped chocolate, a Christmas card, a teddy bear) and then set up a video call. You read out the list and whoever makes it back to the screen with the item first wins a point. Make sure you have an unusual tiebreaker on the list in case things end in a draw. It’s a great way to add some physical fun to the day and let the kids run off steam, plus Grandpa gets a workout.5. Get your game face onSome kids find video calling difficult – either losing focus or struggling to engage in conversation through the screen. And that’s OK – there’s nothing remotely festive about forcing the fun if one side isn’t into it. A great alternative for older kids and grandparents to stay in relaxed contact is to set them both up with some online games that don’t require face-to-face interaction – Uno, Boggle With Friends and Scrabble Go let you play against friends remotely. And an online game of Trivial Pursuit will satisfy the family’s appetite for some friendly competition, proving that you really don’t need to be in the same room for a game to descend into childish arguments.Vodafone #KeepConnectingFamily traditions help keep us connected to the ones we love, and that’s more important than ever at Christmas.At Vodafone, we’ve built a strong mobile and broadband network that keeps you close to your family and friends … so that we’re still together, even if we are apart.Find out more about how we’re helping you to keep connecting to the magic this Christmas.Third party products mentioned in this article are not Vodafone products and are not associated with Vodafone or endorsed by Vodafone in any way.

But a year ago it lost some of its most prized seats to the Conservatives – and so far voters appear to have few regretsExactly a year ago this past weekend, the Conservatives won a thumping majority by taking seats across the midlands and north of England. These constituencies had once been so safe for Labour that they had come to be known as the ‘red wall’. But in recent years there were ominous signs that support for the party was faltering. The Brexit referendum was the first time many broke with Labour and then on December 12 2019, the red wall crumbled.  One brick to fall was Leigh in Greater Manchester, a place that had voted solidly Labour since 1922. Helen Pidd tells Anushka Asthana that as part of a five-year reporting project she has been following voters in the town to gauge their current sentiments about the government they helped elect. Despite a torrid year and a looming Brexit crisis, she finds few willing to express regrets about switching their votes.

For the latest coronavirus updates from around the world, head to our global blogAnd ITV’s Paul Brand says no decision has yet been taken.PA Media also report talks are expected to resume on Wednesday. A Welsh government spokesman said: “The leaders of the devolved administrations and Michael Gove met this evening to discuss the arrangements over the Christmas period. They will reconvene tomorrow to confirm the position.”The meeting was scheduled as the UK government came under increasing pressure to tighten the rules for the holiday period. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Boris Johnson should order a rethink because taking the wrong decision now could have “severe” consequences. (See 1pm.) Two leading medical journals, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, said allowing up to three household to mix over Christmas, as planned, would be a “major error that will cost many lives”. (See 10.45am.) Before this afternoon’s meeting chaired by Gove, Downing Street said the rules were being kept under constant review. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told MSPs that her government was considering whether the proposed rules should be tightened in the light of the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus, nine cases of which have been discovered in Scotland. (See 3.06pm.) But Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told MSs (members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament) that he was concerned that not allowing an easing of restrictions at Christmas could lead to a “free-for-all”. (See 2.28pm.) A YouGov poll suggests people think the government should abandon plans to relax the restrictions over Christmas by almost two to one. (See 5.30pm.)That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here.Education unions have objected to the suggestion that teachers should be involved in administering the lateral flow tests (or rapid result tests) being rolled out in all secondary schools in England from January. (See 12.26pm.)In its announcement the Department for Education said that, although staff would not have to give up time over the holidays to learn how to use the new tests, “existing staff meetings or inset days can be used for training as appropriate”.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said that although these tests could be “potentially helpful”, they were “not a panacea”. In a statement he went on:The NASUWT will be seeking urgent further clarification from the DfE about how these tests are to be administered and by whom. The NASUWT is clear that it is not the responsibility of teachers or school leaders to undertake testing of pupils or employees and will be expecting the government to confirm that it does not expect teaching staff to carry out this work.And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers union, said in a statement that the government should consider getting volunteers to administer the tests, not teachers. He said:Removing school staff from the classroom and retraining them to administer clinical tests is a deeply flawed proposal. Schools and parents alike will want every education professional focused on supporting pupils to catch-up on lost learning throughout the spring term.The government must look at alternatives to asking school staff to administer these tests. One solution could be to use the volunteers who signed up earlier in the year to support the NHS. They could be trained, accredited and insured and then sent in to support schools. This could then be expanded further if it was seen to be successful.This is broadly in line with the findings of an Ipsos MORI poll on the same topic (see 3.55pm), although YouGov, which posed the question in a different format, found even less support for the Christmas mixing plan drawn up by the four nations of the UK.According to YouGov, support for tougher rules over Christmas than currently allowed is relatively consistent across region, class and gender.Labour supporters are more in favour of maintaining restrictions at Christmas than Conservatives, YouGov found. And Lib Dem supporters are most in favour (making them, on this, the most illiberal).All of this supports a theory my colleague John Harris floated on Twitter earlier.Huge disparities in the amount of classroom time pupils have received across England since schools re-opened in September have been revealed for the first time by stark new figures on school attendance.The 10 boroughs in England where children’s education has been most disrupted since schools re-opened following six months of lockdown are all areas where deprivation is worse than the national average.In Oldham, one of the worst-hit areas, one headteacher said “self harm has gone through the roof” after almost 200 Year 11s missed five weeks of learning.Concern that schools in the worst-hit local areas are getting a “quadruple hit” was voiced by the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, who said that disruption to attendance and increased pandemic costs came on top of existing poorer educational outcomes and deprivation.The total number of Covid-related deaths across the UK as per the three statistical agencies, the ONS, National Records for Scotland and NISRA, which count all deaths where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, now stands at 78,256.A further 3,031 deaths have occurred since these agencies last reported, bringing the overall Covid death toll across the UK since the pandemic began to 81,287. The figure is higher than the government’s Covid death toll of 64,908. The latter figure only covers people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.The UK government has updated its coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures.NHS England has recorded 293 further coronavirus hospital deaths. There were 75 in the north-east and Yorkshire, 63 in the Midlands, 55 in the north-west, 35 in the south-east, 31 in London, 21 in the south-west and 13 in the east of England. The details are here.A week ago today the equivalent figure was 325.But he has said the most pressing problem is staff numbers with 1,500 more NHS workers off than in September – the reason why some non-urgent operations are being postponed.“We simply don’t have staff in place to keep everything the health service wants to do going,” he said.Drakeford did not say whether he would take up the UK government’s offer to treat some non-Covid patients in England. (See 12.45pm.) Asked about the offer at first minister’s questions he said a mutual aid system had operated through the Covid crisis, which included Wales sending 11m items of PPE to England.This blog often starts in the morning with quotes from whichever minister was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, it’s almost never a woman.The chair of the exams regulator in England, Roger Taylor, is to stand down at the end of the year after what he described as “a very difficult summer”.Taylor was at the centre of the furore that followed the summer exams fiasco, and saw the government abandon GCSEs and A-level grades determined by Ofqual’s algorithm, in favour of school-assessed grades.As a blame-game got under way, the  revealed that Taylor issued an ultimatum threatening to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, gave the exams regulator his full backing. While Taylor stayed on in the immediate aftermath, Ofqual’s chief regulator Sally Collier resigned soon after results were published in August.Announcing his resignation, Taylor said: After what has been a very difficult summer, I am leaving the organisation in good shape and in good hands.We have put in place measures for young people sitting exams in 2021 which represent the best approach in these difficult times.Taylor, who has been Ofqual chair since 2016, will be replaced temporarily by an interim chair, Ian Bauckham, who has been on the Ofqual board since 2018.This is from Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, on Dominic Cummings’ huge pay rise when he worked for No 10. (See 3.34pm.) She said:Boris Johnson defended Dominic Cummings when he broke lockdown rules - then awarded him a £50,000 pay rise. Yet he’s freezing pay for key workers and refusing to give our care workers a pay rise to the living wage.Cummings’ bumper bonus is an insult to key workers denied the pay rise they deserve. It’s another example of how under this government it is one rule for the Tory Party and their friends and another for the rest of us.Dominic Cummings was handed a pay rise of at least £40,000 for his role as the prime minister’s top adviser, new figures suggest. Cummings – whose trip to Durham during the height of the first national Covid-19 lockdown prompted an outcry – was paid between £95,000-£99,999 in 2019 but a report reveals his pay packet was bumped up to £140,000-£144,999 this year.The disclosure is included in the publication of a Cabinet Office report (pdf) which details the £9.6m total cost – including salary, national insurance and pension contributions – for 102 government special advisers – referred to in Westminster as Spads – from April 2019 to March 2020.Last month, it emerged that Cummings was leaving his No 10 post, as was his ally, the communications chief, Lee Cain. The Cabinet Office report states: “Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings are in the process of leaving their government posts and are not included in the above list. They are, however, included in the December FTE numbers. Both iniduals were in PB4 and pay band £140,000-£144,999.”Meanwhile, the newly appointed No 10 press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who will be fronting televised Downing Street briefings next year, earns between £125,000 and £129,999, according to the report.In her statement to the Scottish parliament, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said that the rise in Covid cases, which is currently less severe in Scotland than parts of England and Wales, but also news about the new variant, made this afternoon’s four nations call about the Christmas rules “sensible”. She went on:I’m not going into it with a fixed view because I think it’s important we have that discussion across the four nations given family patterns across the UK, but I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting.She said that it would be preferable to come to a four nations agreement but said that, if that were not possible, “of course we would consider within the Scottish government what we think is appropriate”.Here is a summary of the main points in Nicola Sturgeon’s statement to MSPs about coronavirus.In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has just told MSPs that her government is considering whether any “additional precautions are necessary” over Christmas in the light of what has emerged about the new variant of the coronavirus, which may be causing the virus to spread more quickly. She said she would be discussing this with the other four nation governments in a call this afternoon which she said she requested yesterday.A senior source at a London hospital trust expressed astonishment that the government was planning to relax the rules for Christmas and warned it would lead to “disaster”. The senior executive said:I know I may come across as a Scrooge when I say this but if we relax the rules, it will hurt badly. Travelling and mixing households are the right ingredients for disaster. We are already seeing the figures rising in London, things are already looking quite bad. Relaxing the rules will only make it worse.London will move into Tier 3 restrictions at midnight tonight. Hospitals will inevitably have to cancel surgery if the five-day Christmas release from the rules leads to even more beds filling up with people who have got Covid as a direct result of the temporarily permitted mingling, the executive added. We are doing our very best to keep all our services open but if we get more Covid-19 cases we may have to shut down some services again and this will be to the detriment of the country. I would like to see a more rational approach.These comments reflect widespread and mounting anxiety and alarm among hospital bosses that the Christmas plan is misguided and could leave hospitals struggling in January and February - which are usually their busiest months anyway - to cope with a new influx of Covid patients.

ESPN reports the deal will earn the Greek star $228.2m.The 26-year-old forward announced the deal on Tuesday on Twitter.“This is my home, this is my city,” he posted. “I’m blessed to be able to be a part of the Milwaukee Bucks for the next 5 years. Let’s make these years count. The show goes on, let’s get it.”The deal ends months of speculation about Antetokounmpo’s future. Most of the talk centered around whether Antetokounmpo would opt to enter free agency following hints in the offseason that he wanted to be paired with another superstar.With an average annual value of $45.6m, it is the largest contract in NBA history, according to The Athletic.Washington Wizards guard Russell Westbrook signed a five-year, $206.8m contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2018, with an annual average salary of $41.4m. Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry signed a five-year, $201.2m extension in 2017.Antetokounmpo’s agent, Alex Saratsis, confirmed the details of the contract with ESPN. It includes an opt-out after the fourth year. His decision means the Bucks will hang on to their biggest superstar since Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who led Milwaukee to its lone NBA title in 1971 but demanded a trade and was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1975.Antetokounmpo won defensive player of the year honors along with his second straight MVP award in 2019-20. He posted career highs in scoring (29.5) and rebounding (11.4) and led the Bucks (56-17) to the best record in the Eastern Conference.The four-time All-Star has career averages of 20.1 points, 8.9 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.3 blocks and 1.2 steals in 528 games (463 starts) with the Bucks. He was Milwaukee’s first-round pick (15th overall) in 2013."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20a5ec530910fabdd8bedfc81c64b335fe4b0487/0_390_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n\u0026s=6fc6cdf895c69fe910a34916f99d9df7","title":"best true wireless earbuds airpods samsung jabra sennheiser anker compared and ranked","story":"Our updated list of great Bluetooth truly wireless earbuds – at the best prices right now It wasn’t long ago that true wireless earbuds, those that don’t need any wires even between the earphones, weren’t very good. Solid connectivity was a challenge, dropouts were infuriatingly common and battery life was woeful.But they all offered that taste of freedom from wires that is like a ratchet – once you’ve experienced tangle-free listening, you’ll never go back.Now there are loads of truly wireless earbuds on the market offering all sorts of features, designs and sound. None of them are bargain basement, and it’s difficult to know which ones are worth buying. So here’s a guide to separate the wheat from the chaff.This  buyer’s guide to true wireless earbuds was last updated on 15 December, and represents the best available models at the time. As new models are released and tested, this guide will be updated to help you choose the right earbuds for you.Welcome to one of the ’s new buyer’s guides. This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.Samsung’s fourth-generation true wireless earbuds may not look all that different from 2019’s Galaxy Buds, but the Buds+ have a few meaningful changes that keep them at the top of the pile for regular, everyday earbuds in 2020.Physically nothing has changed, meaning they still small, light and super-comfortable. If you have issues with bits of other earbuds pressing uncomfortably on parts of your ears, try these. You have to like the feel of a traditional silicone earbud tip in your ear canal, but they have the added advantage of staying put and blocking out background noise.They do not protrude far from your ear, fitting under hats just fine, and come with a series of soft stabilising wings if you need them.A touchpad on the outside takes care of controls. Tap to pause or play, double and triple-tap to skip track. A touch and hold gesture can be switched between turning on or temporarily piping ambient sound into the earbuds, triggering your voice assistant or to change the volume (left to go down, right to turn it up). Take both earbuds out and the music automatically pauses. Hold both for three seconds to pair another device. It all works very well.The Buds+ sound really good producing detailed, balanced audio with a good amount of low-end punch. They can be cranked up to be uncomfortably loud, and come with a basic preset equaliser. They sound far better than most rivals at this price, but can’t match the most expensive earbuds for pure sonic quality.A solid connection is a minimum requirement these days. The Buds + support Bluetooth 5.0, have a rock solid connection with a large range of devices, can be used inidually, and have improved support across Android and Apple products, thanks to the Buds+ app on both platforms. They work well with Windows and can be hotswapped between devices without having to manually disconnect each one. The standard SBC and AAC codecs are supported alongside Samsung’s proprietary scalable codec and a Samsung-only low-latency mode for gaming. Samsung devices also get instant pairing and pairing syncing between devices such as phone and tablet.Call quality is improved over the original Buds, with better clarity and reduction of background noise for the recipient. Battery life too is much improved, lasting up to 11 hours between charges which is far longer than most. The compact flip-top case is one of the best, easily fitting in the money pocket of a pair of jeans and is capable of fully charging the earbuds once for a total of 22 hours’ playback. The case can be charged via USB-C or wireless charging.The earbuds are even rated a seven out of 10 by repair-specialists iFixit for repairability, including the ability to replace the battery, which makes the Buds+ far less disposable than rivals.The Galaxy Buds+ sound great, are small and comfortable, have a great case, last a long time on a charge, are potentially repairable and work with everything, making them the best general-purpose earbuds available.Buy if: you want a simple set of truly wireless earbuds that sound good and just workDon’t buy if: you don’t like canal-budsThird time’s the charm for Sony. The WF-1000XM3 finally live up to the Sony heritage with not only effective noise cancelling but truly great sound too.The M3 part of the name aligns them with Sony’s excellent WH-1000XM3 headphones from 2019, which have class-leading sound and noise cancelling. The true wireless earbud version inherits the same noise cancelling chip and are almost as effective, reducing or eliminating train, road and plane noise, leaving you free to listen to your music at lower, more comfortable volumes.The sound sparkles with detail, energy and clarity, while punchy bass produces a lovely full sound, just edging out the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2.Bluetooth 5 means connectivity is strong and lipsync issues have been eliminated. While the design is attractive, particularly in the black and copper colour, the earbuds are massive and took a bit of trial and error to get the fit right with the correct earbud tip (seven pairs are included). On-earbud controls are good including volume controls following a software update. Touch and hold one to activate ambient passthrough to listen out for announcements.Battery life is solid too, lasting up to six hours with noise cancelling active or eight with it off, and up to 32 hours with trips in the case. Like the earbuds the case is also fairly large and difficult to pocket. They’re not cheap, but if you want genuinely great sound, the WF-1000XM3 are the ones to buy still a year on from release.Brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling and solid connectivity, complemented by solid battery life and an attractive design, the WF-1000XM3 are still the best-sounding true wireless earbuds.Buy if: you want the best sound and great noise cancellingDon’t but if: you want something smaller and more pocket-friendlyJabra’s fourth-generation true wireless earbuds are the company’s best yet.Building on the slimmed-down and more comfortable design of their predecessors, the Elite 85t now have a lighter, more balanced fit with redesigned oval-shaped ear tips that don’t enter your ear canal quite so deeply.They stay put and are more comfortable for extended periods. They are also fairly compact for earbuds with active noise cancelling and don’t protrude as far as their Bose or Sony rivals.A button on each earbud takes car of controls, including volume, with full customisation with the Sound+ app. Connectivity is rock solid, with Bluetooth 5.1, SBC and AAC support, plus the ability to connect to two devices at the same time, such as a phone and a tablet. Only the right earbud can be used on its own, but call quality is good.They sound a lot better than previous efforts and just beat Apple’s AirPods Pro, producing rich and highly detailed but balanced audio with deep bass that doesn’t overly dominate. The noise cancelling is also very effective, blocking most unwanted tones. It can be turned up or down, should you want to let a little of the outside world in.Battery life is good too, with up to five hours with noise cancelling active and an excellent, compact case that can recharge the earbuds 3.5 times for a total of 25 hours’ playback.They have the best combination of brilliant sound, excellent noise cancelling, long battery life, competition-beating connectivity, a comfortable fit and a compact case.Buy if: you want comfortable and compact noise cancelling earbudsDon’t buy if: you exclusively use Apple gear – the AirPods Pro may be betterIf you don’t like blocking out the world, or can’t get on with canal-bud style earphones that enter your ear, look no further than Apple’s AirPods, now in their second generation.They gently rest in your ear with little white stalks sticking down, projecting the sound down your ear holes rather than sitting directly in them. As a consequence you can hear everything happening around you meaning you won’t be able to hear your music on something as loud as the tube in London, and if cranked up to maximum they bleed sound, although not as badly as Apple’s non-wireless EarPods. They sound pretty good considering the lack of isolation, with reasonable bass and clarity.The AirPods work best with Apple gear, automatically syncing pairing across any Apple devices you might have, but can also be paired with Android or other devices. Connectivity is rock solid with an iPhone and recent Android devices and PCs.Where they fall down is on-board controls - there’s basically just one, a double tap. When connected to a non-iPhone it pauses or plays music. Hooked up to an iOS device you have the option to trigger Siri, pause or skip track on each earbud, which means one can summon Siri while the other pauses. There’s no volume control. Take them out and it pauses the music.With the second generation AirPods you can also just say “Hey Siri” at any time without having to tap anything to activate Apple’s voice assistant. After having to re-teach Siri to recognise my voice, it generally worked well, even with music blasting out. But Siri can be a little slow, particularly when you have poor connectivity on your smartphone. You also get odd looks doing so on public transport.The AirPods’ other strengths are that you can use either of the earbuds in mono, call quality is pretty good, and the charging case is the best in the business. The AirPods last about five hours of music and can be fully charged around five times by the case, which itself is charged via a Lightning cable. They are also available with a new wireless charging case (£40$40 extra) for powering up on Qi-compatible chargers.Seamless connectivity with Apple products is key, but they sound pretty good, have an excellent case and are a decent alternative to canal-buds, even for Android users.Buy if: you use Apple products and don’t need sound isolationDon’t buy if: you want to block out the sounds outside worldIf you wish Apple’s AirPods had better isolation and gripped on to your ear like a vice, look no further than the Beats PowerBeats Pro.Like the AirPods the PowerBeats Pro have great connectivity with an iPhone, which courtesy of the Beats app even extends to Android. Rock solid connectivity in all conditions is paired with excellent controls. Both earbuds have proper volume rocker controls, plus a multifunction button for controlling playback, skipping tracks or activating Siri or Google Assistant.The flexible ear hook loops over the back of your ear and with a bit of adjustment holds them firmly in place on your head - no amount of jumping, giggling or pounding the tarmac is going to shake these free. They’re also sweat resistant so will be fine in the rain or hard workout just don’t run them under a tap.The silicone earbud tip offers some isolation from the world around you. The forward, energetic sound is ideal for powering through a run or gym session, while also doing a good job with most music genres, banishing the all-bass Beats sound profile to the history books.Call quality is excellent too, while battery life is a class-leading eight hours with another 1.5 charges in the case.The enormous case is the worst thing about them. It’s robust and works just fine, but you’re not going to be able to fit it in a pocket. They’re also pricy, so if you just want basic buds for the gym, these aren’t for you.You want the AirPod-like convenience of connectivity and features with an iPhone (or Android with app), with class-leading battery, good sound, excellent controls including a real volume rocker, plus an ear hook design that’s unshakeable.Buy if: you want rock-solid all-rounders that won’t come off no matter what you doDon’t but if: you want something smaller and cheaperAnker have several good value true wireless earbuds to pick from, but the Liberty Air 2 have the best combination of sound, call quality, sound and price, particularly when picked up on a deal.They have an AirPods-like design with stalks but a well-fitting traditional silicone ear tip that provides solid noise isolation. They’re comfortable for hours, come with five different sizes of earbud tip and are IPX5 sweat-resistant, so fine for using on a run.The earbuds have excellent Bluetooth 5 connectivity supporting SBC, AAC and aptX audio formats, which is rare at this price. Each earbud can be used independently and call quality is excellent on both sides of the call with very good background noise reduction.The Air 2 also have on-earbud touch controls, including playback and volume, plus the music pauses when you remove one from your ear. The battery lasts for up to seven hours on a single charge. They slot into an good, small and pocketable flip-top case for charging up to three times for a total of 28 hours’ playback. The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is also rare at this price.Sound is good, with punchy bass, strong treble and bright highs, plus a fairly open tone that’s generally pleasant. They won’t trouble the best on the market, but they’re good for the money.The Soundcore app for Android and iOS has an equaliser and HearID, which gives you a hearing test then customises the sound accordingly. The app also handles control settings and updates.One of the few downsides is that they don’t support seamless switching, meaning you have to manually disconnect them from one device before connecting to another.Good connectivity, battery, fit, sound and design, plus solid controls including volume combine with a good pocketable case and excellent call quality to make fantastic value true wireless earbuds.Buy if: you want great all-round truly wireless earbuds on a budgetDon’t buy if: you want better sound and seamless switchingThere are many different types of wireless Bluetooth headphones, but the newest and neatest are the truly wireless earbuds.Unlike neckband earphones or regular Bluetooth earbuds, truly wireless earbuds have no cables connecting between them, freeing the wearer of all cords and cables.Removing all cables means transmitting audio and data between them through your head, which is not an easy task. Many early versions could not maintain a solid connection and therefore had frequent, annoying dropouts.A codec is the system used to transmit the audio signal over the Bluetooth connection which both the phone and headphones must support. There are a variety of codecs available for Bluetooth headphones, with SBC being the default, which is the lowest quality and supported by all Bluetooth audio devices. AAC is an upgrade that most support, with Sony\u0027s LDAC and Qualcomm\u0027s aptX, aptX HD, aptX Low Latency and the newest aptX Adaptive supported by some.Apple\u0027s iPhone notably does not support Bluetooth codecs higher than AAC, but many Android smartphones and newer Bluetooth headphones support at least aptX.Along with variances in audio quality, different codecs have different latency in their transmission of sound. Latency is the time it takes for a sound to be sent to the earphone and be played, which is important because if it is too high the audio track does not match up with video, leading to irritating lipsync issues.Most headphones that only support SBC will have lipsync issues, while AAC and higher can help negate the problem.Some earbuds have the ability to play sounds from the outside world picked up by microphones through the speakers, providing an awareness of what\u0027s happening in the world through the earbuds. Some automatically activate ambient sound on pause, while others can mix it with music or have dedicated modes for listening out for announcements or similar.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEach earbud has to have a battery in it, therefore to squeeze everything into a small enough package to fit in your ear has mean small batteries and fairly short runtimes. But they are not all born equally with some lasting as much as five hours between charges.Short battery life and lack of wires means most truly wireless earbuds come with a charging case with an integrated battery to keep the earbuds safe and topped up. Some charging cases are huge and heavy, others small and light - important to note if you want to carry it in your pocket.Most will have a canal-bud design with an ear tip of varying sizes that enters the ear canal. Alongside the tip many have wings or a body design that is intended to lock into the hollow next to the ear canal called the concha to hold it in place.Here is where the most comfort problems arise, as too much pressure on the soft bits of the ear around the concha will cause pain.These truly wireless earbuds are still worth buying, if the top five don’t fit the bill.Amazon’s first true wireless earbuds offer a lot for the money with noise reduction (not full cancellation), touch controls and good sound, plus full Alexa integration. A recent update also added fitness tracking options.But their large size, average battery life, larger than the best case and sometimes unreliable touch panels hold them back from being truly great.With good sound, great connectivity with Apple devices, solid noise cancelling, good call quality, a compact case and a set of squeezable playback controls on the stalks, the AirPods Pro are some of the best true wireless earbuds you can buy.But they are just pipped to the top noise cancelling spot by the Jabra Elite 85t with better sound, longer battery life and cross-platform support. Still, the AirPods Pro are a great choice for anyone who exclusively uses Apple gear thanks to a range of smart features such as spatial audio, instant pairing and seamless switching – particularly when bought on a deal.If you want the most effective noise cancelling in true wireless earbuds, the new Bose QuietComfort Earbuds are the new kings. Unlike rivals they don’t block up your ear canals with little earbuds – instead the soft silicone tips rest in your concha. holding themselves in place with a flexible fin.They’re very comfortable, sound good, block out more noise than the competition and have up to six hours’ battery. But they’re also huge, expensive and have a large case that’s not as pocketable as the Jabra Elite 85t, holding them back from being the very best.The Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 come very close to delivering on all counts. They have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with AAC and aptX support, a long eight-hour battery, good controls including a way to adjust volume and they even sound good, with balanced, rounded audio.The case is also one of the best available, adding up to 36 hours of playback to the earbuds while still being very pocketable, fitting into the money pocket of a pair of jeans long with only a handful of the best.The problem is, they’re huge. They have a really large aperture, making getting the earbud tip to fit without blocking your ear canal a bit of a chore and they stick out a mile, looking like something Nichelle Nichols’s Uhura would use in classic Star Trek. The big trunk is uncomfortable in my ears, meaning any 30-minute-plus listening becomes painful. A real shame.The Creative Outlier Air are good budget value and have solid sound, connectivity, battery life and controls. Call quality is pretty good and they’re sweat resistant.But they are a bit on the large side and the case is pretty big compared with the best in the business, meaning they have been replaced by the Anker Liberty Air 2 as the top budget option.Google’s Pixel Buds are essentially the firm’s AirPods rival with a set of features reserved for Android devices. Used with an Android device with access to the Google Play Store – and the Pixel Buds app – they have instant pairing, seamless device switching and Google Assistant integration that includes real-time language translation.The touch controls are excellent, they are low profile but have a unique fit with both a traditional earbud and a small silicone wing that may prove uncomfortable for some. The small case is great and battery life is solid. The sound is good, but they don’t isolate very well – the vents prevent a “plugged-in” feeling but let background noise in too.Huawei’s latest Bluetooth earbuds have a very familiar design and noise cancelling, but fall slightly short of the AirPods Pro. They have a traditional silicone earbud tip with a light and comfortable fit, rectangular stalks with both squeeze for playback and swipe controls for volume, plus auto-pause on remove.Noise cancelling is solid, switching between modes depending on background sounds. Audio quality is good, but is affected by turning on the noise cancelling, which reduces bass and range. Call quality is good, while battery life is just over four hours and a total of 20 with the case, which is a little chunkier than the best but recharges via USB-C or wireless charging.They have Bluetooth 5.2 with AAC, but their ace in the hole is the ability to connect to two devices at once. The Huawei Ai Life app is needed for updates and settings, but isn’t available on iOS. They can also be fiddly to get out of the case.The Jabra Elite 75t are excellent alternatives to the Samsung Galaxy Buds+ with a new and improved design. They sound great with plenty of bass, rock-solid connectivity, long battery life, good controls and a customisable equaliser in the Sound+ app.Call quality is good and the case is compact, charges the buds 2.5 times for a total of 28 hours’ playback. They’re smaller and more comfortable than their predecessors, but are still on the larger side and are more expensive and slightly less comfortable than the Galaxy Buds+.LG’s Tone Free earbuds have solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity, comfortable fit with a traditional silicone earbud, up to six hours of battery life and a small round case that can charge them twice more.The touch controls are a bit hit and miss, the sound quality is a little muddy at times and they are significantly undercut by the competition. But the they have one party trick: the case blasts the earbuds with UV light to kill bacteria when charging.Although they were one of last year’s better true wireless earbuds, the Track Air+ are beaten by newer rivals.The Libratones are attractive, have rock-solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with aptX support, great sound and limited noise cancelling. Add to that a tiny case, battery life of about six hours and wireless charging.The downsides are lack of volume control on the earbuds, lack of AAC support for an iPhone and an easily marked case.Microsoft’s Surface Buds are unusual true wireless earbuds that have a completely different fit and design to most. They have an open design that doesn’t fill your ear canal and so doesn’t block any noise, but also has a wing that holds them in place and a duct that pipes the sound into your ear.The outside is large, flat touch-sensitive disc that protrudes from your ear and is rather attention-grabbing. But they sound good, last a decent time on battery and have unique features for Windows such as real-time transcription in Office. They lack AAC support so are not best for Apple users.Like black Apple AirPods but with a traditional isolating earbud on the end to enter your ear, the RHA TrueConnect 2 – now in their second iteration – sound good with strong bass, solid isolation and better call quality at a cheaper price.Connectivity is much improved, but only supports SBC for audio. Battery life has been more than doubled to nine hours. The buttons have been replaced by taps for controls. The case is attractive and provides up to 44 hours of playback, but is large compared with the best.Samsung’s novel bean-shaped earbuds have an open fit similar to the Surface Earbuds and AirPods but fit entirely within the concha of your ear. The Galaxy Buds Live sound better than rivals, too. If you want compact earbuds that don’t block your ears, these are for you.They have noise cancelling but it can only handle low rumbles. Battery life of eight hours plus a small case that can charge them 2.5 times for a total of 28 hours’ playback is very good. They have touch controls, good call quality, solid Bluetooth 5 connectivity with SBC and AAC support (plus a the proprietary SAC audio format for Samsung devices), and fast-pairing for Android and Windows.They’re more expensive than Samsung’s excellent Buds+ and won’t be for everyone, but they’re great for those looking for the open-type fit.The second generation of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds offer top-quality sound and solid but not class-leading noise cancelling. The earbuds are quite large but they last up to six hours between charges. The case fully charges the earbuds three times, for a total of 28 hours’ playback, but is a bit bigger than the best on the market.Connectivity is excellent, supporting Bluetooth 5 with SBC, AAC and aptX. Call quality is good but a bit distant. Only the right earbud can be used on its own. Silver touchpads handle playback and volume control.The best bit is how they sound: rich, lively and warm, producing sparkling audio second only to Sony’s WF-1000XM3.Jabra Elite Sport – Big, bulky and bettered by the newer Jabra Elite models – £200Jaybird Run – Solid for runners, but unacceptable latency issues – £159JBL Free X – Large case and terrible latency issues – £120JLabs JBuds Air – Sound fine, but only SDC support means latency issues – £50NuForce BE Free8 – OK sound, but constant hiss and connectivity issues – £200Skullycandy Indy – Sound ok, but get stuck in the case and suffer lag with an iPhone – £70TicPods Free – Good sound and controls, but terrible latency – £120Urbanista Stockholm – AirPod ripoffs with poor fit and weak sound – £89 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But does this rural soap reflect the reality of country life, or is it a fantasy liberal never-never land for urban audiences?The longest-running drama in the world is a soap opera about life in an English farming village. Every week, 5 million people listen to The Archers on BBC Radio 4. It is also the broadcaster’s most downloaded radio show. It first aired 70 years ago – that is to say, during the era of the horse-drawn plough and tea on the ration. One of the current cast, June Spencer, who plays the formidable matriarch Peggy Woolley, appeared in the first episode on New Year’s Day, 1951. She is 101 years old.Because it is middle England’s omnipresent soundtrack, it can be easier to see The Archers as some kind of naturally occurring phenomenon than, say, an experimental, durational artwork that blurs the boundaries between fantasy and reality or a “peculiarly English epic” as its former editor, or showrunner, Sean O’Connor describes it. To the uninitiated, on the other hand, it can appear somewhere on a scale between charmingly quaint, deeply bewildering and insufferably smug. An Irish friend told me she regarded the entire Archers mis-en-scène – “the village green, Bonfire Night, the slightly mysteriously located Big House, the cider club and the posh livery stables, even the Bull’s beer garden” as “utterly exotic”. A puzzled Texan, invited to listen by the hosts of the BBC’s Americast podcast, described it as “like Downton, except without the interesting period detail or drama”.The Archers was pitched in 1950 by Godfrey Baseley, a Birmingham-based producer of farming programmes, as a means of encouraging improved postwar food production. And, though the Ministry of Agriculture ceased sending memos to the BBC about warble fly and swine flu in the 70s, the shadow of this didactic past remains a key part of the show’s unlikely fictive mixture, its longevity, and its success. Abstruse details of pig husbandry and milking-parlour technology are woven into a narrative in which the idealised rituals of rural life (jam-making, the flower and produce show, endless cups of tea), form the weirdly eventless, diurnal backdrop to waves of high drama that may or may not be typical of life in the English countryside.Aside from floods, fraud, suicide, manslaughter, diamond smugglers, spies, a near-fatal stabbing, a plane crash, a collapsing church tower, rape, arson and a formidable tally of horrific motor-vehicle accidents, these have included a hostage-taking situation in the village shop (scripted in the 90s by the great screenwriter Sally Wainwright, before the multiple Baftas), and, recently, the accidental exploding of the kitchen wing of Grey Gables, a country house hotel, by a hapless labourer in the clutches of a villainous modern slaver.It is a mark of The Archers’ status as a British institution that Billy Connolly once jokingly suggested that the show’s theme tune – the aggressively catchy Barwick Green, a “maypole dance” from Arthur Wood’s suite My Native Heath – ought to become the national anthem. While it has not yet ousted God Save the Queen, snatches of it were heard during the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, and royalty has condescended to appear on the show, as itself, twice: the Duchess of Cornwall in 2011 and Princess Margaret, who opened the fete in 1984. (Asked by the director to sound a little more as if she were enjoying herself, the latter replied: “Well, I wouldn’t be, would I?”)Some unlikely figures have pitched for cameos in the show. O’Connor told me that in his time he’d received calls from representatives of Bill Gates (“I couldn’t think of how the Women’s Institute would imagine they’d get him”), and from the office of the Evening Standard’s proprietor Evgeny Lebedev (“I told them I’d come back to them if the Borsetshire Echo was taken over by a larger syndicate”). O’Connor invited the Pet Shop Boys to play themselves headlining “Loxfest” in 2015. Neil Tennant told me that despite not being a regular listener, he nevertheless considered himself part of a kind of “ambient listenership” of a show that “has been there all my life”. Appearing on it was, he said, “definitely a highlight of our career”.Ambridge, the village at the heart of the show, is said to be about 20 miles from Birmingham, where the show has always been made – though characters are largely confined, as if by a mysterious force field, to the county of Borsetshire, with its market town of Borchester, cathedral city of Felpersham and scattering of quaintly named villages. The nomenclature of the dwellings in Ambridge is both slightly generic (there must be hundreds of Grange Farms and Home Farms in England) and nostalgically pastoral: Hollowtree, Honeysuckle Cottage, Willow Farm. You won’t find these places on a map, and yet it seems crucial to the drama that it is neither of the south or north of England, but of the Midlands. There is just the faintest trace of Middlemarch, Middle-earth and the Forest of Arden in the DNA of The Archers.Its viewpoint is firmly of the social middle, too. Baseley invented a structure in which the Archer family would be flanked, in class terms, by the “squire” on the one hand, and a less progressive, more foolish farmer on the other – Walter Gabriel, who provided much early comedy of the rude mechanicals variety. Though the social stereotypes have loosened up, The Archers retains this basic shape, with the landed gentry, the Pargetters, on one extreme, and the Grundys and Horrobins forming the community’s lumpenproletariat. This marks it off from the biggest British TV soaps, EastEnders and Coronation Street, which focus, in their urban locales, on working-class characters. It says a great deal about the British weakness for a buffoonish posh boy that the audience has still not quite forgiven its former editor of 22 years’ standing, Vanessa Whitburn, for having Nigel Pargetter plunge to his death from the roof of his stately home a decade ago, as a 60th-anniversary plot shocker. (She received death threats. “Even now, if I give a talk at a Women’s Institute, people ask why I killed him off,” she told me.) On the other hand, former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has recalled that The Archers sharpened his class consciousness as a child. The former Labour leader Neil Kinnock once called for it to be renamed The Grundys and Their Oppressors.The genius of The Archers lies in the fact that farming is inherently dramatic, according to O’Connor. The vagaries of the weather, government policy, Brexit, disease, crop failure – any number of catastrophes may sweep away your livelihood, which is also your home, and your inheritance, and what you hope to pass on to your children – a cue for King Lear-like plots about intergenerational and sibling strife. But its appeal, O’Connor said, lies also in the symbolic power of the English rural landscape.Baseley was alert to the British nostalgia for the land. His pitch, written in August 1950, was focused on a listenership not just of farmers, but of “the general listener, ie, the townsman”. Urban audiences liked – and still like – to feel that they were in touch with the land, with the farming year, with birdsong and lambing and harvest. “There’s a reason Country Life magazine is so popular, and Country Living, and TV programmes like The Great British Bake Off and Springwatch,” O’Connor said. The Archers, wrote its editor of the 70s and 80s, William Smethurst, “is more than a mere drama. It has become a fantasy of England that contains a little bit of the national soul.”‘Real life overheard” was the impression Godfrey Baseley wanted The Archers to create. He succeeded. “For years the listeners believed it absolutely – whatever we did was real to them,” original cast member June Spencer told me. “When listeners wrote to us, we didn’t disillusion them. If we replied, we replied in character.” She remembers receiving a letter in 1966 solemnly informing her of the scandalous, out-of-wedlock pregnancy of her on-air daughter, Jennifer, and asking why she didn’t seem to know about it: “Don’t you listen to the show?” The producers played hard on the listeners’ credulity, or willingness to suspend disbelief, mingling the real and the make-believe: when Christine Archer, owner of the stables, entered her Red Link for the Badminton horse trials in 1957, a real-life horse of the same name competed.Nor was it just the listeners who were sucked in. Norman Painting, who played Phil Archer until his death in 2009, recalled that as the 50s wore on, the actors – who were expected to appear in character at myriad public events – began to identify more strongly with their roles. The idea of being written out, he wrote in his memoir, Forever Ambridge, felt “akin to murder”.The blurring of fact and fiction had troubling consequences. Amid overwork and sudden celebrity, the actor playing Doris Archer, Gwen Berryman, “started to slip over the edge” in the late 50s, according to Smethurt’s history of the show. She had her personal writing paper printed with the fictional address of “Brookfield Farm, Ambridge” (in reality, she lived in industrial Wolverhampton). She even stopped calling fellow actors by their real names. “Gwen Berryman believed implicitly that she was Doris Archer,” Spencer told me.This somewhat disturbing aspect of The Archers may have faded, but to many longtime listeners, among whom I include myself, The Archers certainly feels real. (This, it is true, requires the swallowing of myriad dramatic conventions, including, but not limited to, the near-universal silence of children until they reach their late teens the lack of discussion of politics, the telly or social media and the curious immunity of Borsetshire from the early months of Covid-19.) When, for example, the social-climbing village gossip Susan Carter was imprisoned for harbouring an escaped criminal in 1994, the then home secretary Michael Howard was petitioned by a campaign called Free the Archers One, which argued that her sentence might set a real precedent. Howard declared that he considered the incarceration overly harsh. It is a mark of The Archers’ cultural status that it seemed perfectly natural for a holder of one of Britain’s great offices of state to opine on the fate of a made-up person in a soap.A great deal of The Archers’ illusion of reality derives from its audio form, the way it “drills into people’s brains”, as O’Connor put it. “It gets under the skin: it embeds itself into people’s lives,” said Charlotte Martin, who plays Susan Carter. “Radio does this better than any other medium. Listeners create their own Ambridge.” (In real life, Martin has a second career as a psychologist one of her research areas is auditory hallucinations.) This effect is magnified by the inexorable drip-drip of material: the show airs six 13-minute episodes a week (four under current pandemic conditions), each of which is repeated. There is also an omnibus on Sundays. If you are a Radio 4 listener, you have to be pretty quick to the off button to keep yourself entirely out of range of its charms, and pretty old for it not to have been around all of your life.I can chart my own life through The Archers: its theme-tune was the first music I recognised, according to family legend listening with my mother after lunch was the drowsy daily ritual of the school holidays. Voices like that of Patricia Greene, who has played Jill Archer since 1957, or Trevor Harrison, Eddie Grundy since 1979, are as familiar to me as those of my own family. When I listened to archive recordings to research this piece and heard the comforting voice of Norman Painting, I wept, because it was as if I was hearing the voice of a lost relative, and because I was stepping back into memories of my younger self.Attachment to The Archers is expressed in any number of violently opinionated internet forums: there’s a paradox, or maybe a kind of yearning, in the fact that scattered, online communities cluster so strongly around a fictional community sustained, at least before the pandemic, by unlikely amounts of real, physical contact. (In Ambridge, people pop by for a cuppa with a frequency that would doubtless be oppressive in real life. Texting isn’t great on the radio.) The most venerable of these groups is UMRA, dating back to the infancy of the web, but there are many more, catering for every mood, taste or fan subgroup: Ambridge Addicts, Archers Appreciation, even the Archers Singles Social. Roifield Brown, host of the Archers fan podcast DumTeeDum (named for the theme tune’s insistent rhythm), told me that “the way to understand this world is in terms of extreme leftwing or rightwing politics. These groups are the result of endless schisms and splits.”Academic Archers, a Facebook group that came together through #Archers tweetalongs, hosts an annual conference. Four volumes of half-serious scholarly essays have resulted, with titles such as The Ambridge Paradox: Cake Consumption and Metabolic Health in a Defined Rural Population, and Foucault, Freda Fry and the Power of Silent Characters on the Radio. (Fry, after decades of muteness, was swept to her death by the Borsetshire floods of 2015, a flourish O’Connor told me he pinched from the death of Maggie Tulliver in Mill on the Floss.) Conference speakers are well-advised to hold back on showing photographs of cast members, organisers Cara Courage and Nicola Headlam told me, lest members of another longstanding fan group, Archers Anarchists, start booing (I admit that I, too, have resisted seeing pictures of the cast all my life). “The Archers is a real-life fly-on-the-wall documentary about one of the strangest villages in England,” insists the Anarchists’ website.Declaring The Archers a documentary is an arch joke. But in an important sense the show is “real” – in that it is the authentic material of its audience’s lives, of memory and emotion. When, between 2013 and 2016, the show famously ran a storyline about coercive control, there were listeners who understood the iniquity of their own domestic situations for the first time. A harrowing storyline about Alice Carter – pregnant, alcoholic, in denial – is, at the moment, taking some listeners into difficult, but deeply recognisable places. And Ambridge is inescapably part of the actors’ reality, not least in the ordinary ways that workplaces insinuate themselves into private lives: the actors who play trainee vicar Shula Hebden Lloyd and arch-capitalist Brian Aldridge are a married couple, for example.Harrison, who has played lovable chancer Eddie Grundy for 41 years, since he was 22, developed a strong bond with his on-air father, the late Edward Kelsey. “I knew how Ted was going to deliver a line,” he told me, “and he knew how I was going to deliver a line. It was like a real family.” He told me that when he acts in the studio, he sees the faces of his fellow performers – but behind them, in his imagination, the farm, or the field, or the pub where the scene is set. He listens to the show, too, at home in his own Worcestershire village. “I had the radio on on Sunday, and I closed my eyes and transported myself to Grange Farm and the Bull,” he told me.And yet, of course, The Archers is not real. It is the result of a brilliantly fabricated illusion. Not for nothing was Godfrey Baseley known as “God” by the cast the producers and writers are the deities that preside over the Ambridge universe. Sustaining the illusion of The Archers is the result of a relentless production line. Making the show, Norman Painting recalled, is “like feeding some insatiable monster, some Moloch”.The Archers is created in interlocking five-week cycles, or blocks. “Day dot,” as producer Jessica Bunch calls it, involves an all-day script meeting, usually held in the studio in Birmingham, to prepare the five weeks’ worth of episodes that will be broadcast 10 weeks later. Writers, producers and the agricultural story adviser, Sarah Swadling, come to the meeting armed with a “story pack” issued a few days earlier by producer David Payne. This details the direction of the show, family by family, farm by farm, over the whole cycle. The work of the meeting is to decide how to transform this prose outline into drama.Five out of the 12 writers on the team are assigned to write a week of scripts each. After producing a scene-by-scene synopsis, each writer has two weeks to produce a first draft of their (normally) six episodes. This is quite the deadline: Sally Wainwright, who was driving the number 73 bus in London when she joined The Archers in 1989, told me the only way she could do it was by “getting up at 5am and really putting the hours in – something I’ve done ever since”. She recalled: “You had five scenes per episode, no more than seven characters, and you were supposed to avoid two-handers if you could. You also had to use each character at least twice. But it was a fantastic discipline it enforced a structure that really worked.” (Wainwright is perhaps the most illustrious alumna of the show, with the possible exception of actor Tamsin Greig, who still appears as the Hungary-based farmer Debbie Aldridge from time to time, and Felicity Jones, who graduated from playing Emma Carter to being nominated for an Oscar for her role as Jane Hawking in The Theory of Everything.)The Archers studio, part of the BBC’s Birmingham base, is a curious combination of hi-tech and scruffy, filled with a miscellany of surfaces and objects that magically combine to create the sonic impression of meadows, pig sheds and farmhouse kitchens. A “live” area is covered with parquet flooring conveying the acoustic of large interior spaces: St Stephen’s church, or the banqueting room at Lower Loxley, the Jacobean-fronted pile of the Pargetters. A carpeted “soft” area is used for bedrooms, sitting rooms, the seating area of the Bull here are some nondescript plastic chairs and an old leather-effect sofa. Leading off from it is a “kitchen” with a lino floor, a row of kitchen units and two sinks: a smart Belfast sink for the grander families and an ordinary metal one for less elevated households. A “dead” area, lined with foam acoustic panels to cut out all trace of echo, is used for exterior locations beyond that is “the snail”, a short corridor from which characters can seem to enter scenes from a distance, or sit in “the naughty corner” to record the distant half of a telephone call.As the scenes are recorded, a further, ghostly figure is present, performing a curious shadow-play alongside the actors. Vanessa Nuttall creates foley effects – added sounds that, alongside recorded material dropped in from a vast digital library, create the illusion of Ambridge. Known in BBC-speak as a spot-effects artist (since the effects are made “on the spot”, rather than in post-production), her private term for herself is a “spot ninja”, since she creeps around scenes like a “stealth warrior”. If the characters Harrison and Fallon are in bed together, for example, Nuttall will be in there with them, rustling their duvet. If Shula is out riding, Nuttall will be at her side, jangling a bridle. If a meal is in progress at Bridge Farm, she will be creeping around the table, appearing at an actor’s side from time to time to scrape a fork gently against a plate.According to Barry Farrimond, “There’s a really nice synergy that should happen between the actor and the spot-effects person: their movements and your effort-sounds have to synchronise perfectly. There’s no point me making an effort-sound and three seconds later that being expressed through an object. As an actor you are reading the script, watching the spot-effects person out of the corner of your eye, being aware of where the mic is and where your fellow actors are, and how all of that maps together.”Sometimes sound effects are created by the object itself – only a real Aga door closing can adequately communicate its particular solid clink, Nuttall told me. At other times, a sound must be impersonated, either for practical reasons or because it will not successfully “read” when created by the real thing. Piles of old half-inch magnetic tape become undergrowth or straw. An ancient ironing board, opened and closed, stands in for the farm gates. Hands are squelched through a bowl of yoghurt when a lamb is born. When Helen Archer stabbed her husband, it was a knife through a watermelon, and when brothers Ed and William Grundy have one of their punch-ups, a spot-effects artist will be smashing the living daylights out of a cabbage. The day the script required a canine character to eat crisps, Nutall gamely chomped, doglike, through a packet. She even dials a mobile phone when someone makes a call, convinced that however subtle the sound, every detail counts in creating the world of The Archers in the minds of its 5 million listeners. Nevertheless, Farrimond told me: “For all that how constructed it is, when you are in the zone and you are there with those other characters, The Archers is real.”Time itself is a character in The Archers. The story unspools at the pace of real life its actors age with it, as do its listeners. Its unity of time offers the illusion that we are eavesdropping on lived lives (an aspect of the show that also offers dramatic opportunities, since we so often know more about events than the characters). It also creates the impression that life in Ambridge might even chug along in the absence of its makers. “Just because it doesn’t go out on a Saturday, it doesn’t mean things aren’t happening in Ambridge on a Saturday,” Jessica Bunch told me. “If we stopped the show for a year, I have a pretty good idea of what everyone would be doing all that time. We’d pick them all up again … It exists without all of us, in a funny way.”The day-by-day pace, and continuity of characters, lends the show a kind of resilience. If life takes you away from The Archers for a year or five, it will feel familiar when you return. “I don’t listen to The Archers religiously,” said Wainwright, “but if I drop in I always feel like I know where I am, and who everybody is, and if I don’t, it’s not long before they are talking to someone I know.” TV soaps, with their responsibilities to ratings, are more reliant on the kind of sensational stories that “ravage through characters”, as Wainwright put it, departing after they have served a particular narrative.The Archers, by contrast, with its dynastic focus on a handful of families, can afford to go slow. Once, in Vanessa Whitburn’s time, Tony Archer lost his glasses for an entire year, which became a ridiculous, enjoyable leitmotif. Listeners often claim that this banal, nothing-much-happening quality of The Archers is what they particularly treasure: the passing of the year, the seasonal rituals repeated. But the real-time quality can also bring significant gains for more dramatic storylines – such as the agonising, three-year unfurling of the Helen Archer and Rob Titchener coercive control plot, until Helen finally cracked and stabbed her abusive husband.It is not just this feeling of presentness that gives power to The Archers, but also the ever-deepening territory of its past. The expanding archive of The Archers operates as a kind of “Cumaean Sibyl’s cave”, according to its current editor Jeremy Howe: you can enter it and return with encoded clues to the characters’ possible futures. In practical terms, this archive – which is also the collective memory of its creators and listeners – exists as 20,000 typed index cards, transferred in recent years to a computer database. From here the writers can glean details necessary for continuity: the fact that Brian Aldridge doesn’t like meringue, for instance, or that the Woolleys’ late Staffordshire terrier, Captain, was partial to smoky bacon crisps. But they can also extract “real” memories, such as the books Ruairi Donovan liked as a four-year-old, which, when neatly deployed, can help round out a character’s psyche years later. The past, said Bunch, gives the show “its own momentum … We are the gardeners of this thing, and we plant stuff in different places and shift things around, but we are never starting from scratch.”Nevertheless, it is clear that the editors of the show – its gods – reshape the landscape substantially to reflect their own personalities and preoccupations. William Smethurst’s Ambridge of the 70s and 80s was, for example, identifiably a Tory world, one of conservative class distinctions and gentle social comedy. His impulses, said O’Connor, came from “Austen and Stella Gibbons”. Vanessa Whitburn, who edited from 1991-2013, came in during the era of the big TV soaps such as EastEnders and Brookside. She wanted, she told me, “to re-galvanise the programme. I felt it should have big stories – it had got quiet about that. I was very clear I wanted to have a story about Elizabeth Archer having an abortion. I like stories that allow you to debate the grey areas of life, the pros and cons of what people do.”In Whitburn’s more socially conscious era, for example, Ambridge acquired its first significant non-white character in the form of solicitor Usha Gupta, who was subject to racist attacks. The Grundys were evicted from their farm and rehoused in the ironically named Meadow Rise, a Borchester housing estate. This had the effect – at last – of putting working-class characters at the tragic heart of the show. O’Connor was then a young scriptwriter he borrowed a motif from Hardy’s Jude the Obscure, he told me, when he had Joe Grundy kill his son’s ferrets with a hammer, incompatible as the creatures were with cramped council accommodation. (Like the murder and suicide of Jude’s siblings, it was “done because we are too menny”.)When O’Connor came to edit the show himself, from 2013-16, there was more creative plundering from the English novel. He put the Archers family and Brookfield at the centre of the action, because: “That’s your Wuthering Heights, your Thornfield, your Mansfield Park, and you need to fight over that.” Aside from presiding over Helen Archer’s coercive control story, O’Connor imperilled Ambridge with floods and a trunk road, and put Brookfield up for sale – almost too much plot for some listeners. By contrast, the current editor, Jeremy Howe, told me he was pulling back from the “very issues-based, or story-based” approaches of his immediate predecessors. “I am character-based,” he said. “The goldmine that is The Archers resides in the characters and the actors who play them. It’s about people.”The futures of these characters are dictated, in practical terms, by a long-term planning document presided over by Bunch, which sets out, month by month, what will happen to each family, business, farm, and character, sometimes many years in the future. In practice, the document exists in a state of flux, affected by a number of factors. These include, naturally, the changing and capricious whims of the makers – but also unintended consequences created by short-term plot devices, unexpected chemistry between particular actors that might spark off new storylines, and real-world events such as Covid-19. O’Connor told me that, had he stayed at The Archers, he would have turned Pip Archer, the future inheritor of Brookfield, into a kind of lonely Bathsheba Everdene figure, beset by dramatic and destructive romances, like the heroine of Hardy’s Far from the Madding Crowd. He also had plans for the charming posh boy Freddie Pargetter, son of the unfortunate Nigel (who died falling off his roof). “My story was going to be that Freddie burns down Lower Loxley, which would then be taken over by hoteliers. He would have to become a businessman to buy the family home back. But you would have to spend 15 years with the story to get that moment.”Brexit is exactly the kind of unstable, real-world event that will affect the characters’ futures it needs to be accommodated within the story-world of The Archers, not least because the exit from the EU will have such a significant impact on British farming. But so far it has been recognised through only minor motifs, such as the difficulty of finding seasonal fruit pickers. Sarah Swadling, the agricultural story adviser, commissioned an economist to model the effects of a various kinds of post-EU deal (or no deal) on the Ambridge farms. This, Howe told me, will help inform long-term, post-Brexit stories. But this most noisy, isive and bitter of British debates has so far been all but inaudible. We don’t even know how most of the characters voted – only that Brookfield patriarch David Archer voted to stay, and gay progressive farmer Adam Macy voted to leave.Fans can surely be forgiven if they have enjoyed a space on the radio where talk of Brexit does not have to be endured – I certainly have. Nevertheless, its absence is a clue to an important aspect of the show: that despite its commitment to “real life overheard”, and to Baseley’s early insistence on keeping the show as topical possible, fissures such as Brexit, and arguments over identity politics, have driven themselves so deep into Britain’s soul that the nation is unrepresentable in the form of “Ambridge”.And so The Archers is a parallel universe – an impossible, liberal never-never land of the shires. The Chinese-born writer and film-maker Xiaolu Guo has observed that the drama, with its apparently apolitical presentation of “an oasis of rural England outside the currents of history” is really offering a supremely political position, a peculiarly British ideology: one that privileges endless indirectness and lethargy, endless deflection of real anger and debate, and endless acceptance of the status quo. Limited outbursts of British revolutionary spirit – such as 70s punk – have been, she wrote, “a jagged reaction to the kettle-boiling and cake-baking families who dwelt eternally in the village of Ambridge”.From its first episode in 1951, The Archers “opened a window on to a more desirable world”, wrote Norman Painting, one that offered an antidote to the “apocalyptic, doomsday feeling” that lingered after the war. Ambridge was, and remains, a place to which listeners can retreat: plausible-sounding, but so much safer than real life. There are serious limits on what can be allowed to happen there. Ken Loach’s version of Ambridge – let’s imagine it starring Emma Carter, with an exposé of conditions in the chicken factory and a hard look at the rural housing crisis – wouldn’t quite wash. Nor would Matt Groening’s Ambridge, for a million reasons, including the fact that “you can’t build a nuclear power station on Lakey Hill,” as editor Jeremy Howe put it. (A similar attitude governed The Archers’ depiction of Covid-19: “If you want bodies piled up in front of St Stephen’s church, The Archers is not going to provide it,” he told me back in May.) The ideology of The Archers, in fact, was most clearly set forth as long ago as 1955, after its most sensational episode went out – the death of the glamorous Grace Archer in a fire in the stables at Grey Gables, a broadcasting event that utterly eclipsed the opening night of ITV, Britain’s first commercial television channel. The significant part of the story was not so much the death of the young wife in her husband’s arms, but the dialogue that took place the following day between patriarch Dan Archer (the father-in-law of the dead woman) and his daughter, Christine, who has been played for 67 years by Lesley Saweard.Addressing his distressed daughter, Dan said: “… Me and Simon, there … in the milking shed … we’ve got the same feelings as you and everybody else, but we’ve still had to carry on milking … And all we can do is the same as folks somehow manage to do in similar circumstances. Just carry on.”“Just carry on” is the real story of The Archers. People may die, disaster may strike, but life will endure. There will always be cows to milk, there will be lambs born in the spring, there will be harvest in the autumn. The months roll, the years turn, and The Archers is still there, embodying its own ideology, by itself continuing and enduring. And in this fictional world, everything will be all right, even if it won’t – it really won’t – out here in the real world, in our cold and fractured world. “I don’t know what the final episode of The Archers will be,” said Howe, “and I hope I’m never tasked with it. But whatever happens, it will” – and he slapped his kitchen table twice for emphasis – “end well. All will be well and all will be well and all manner of things will be well.” • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4409770.1605434900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"400 yes 400 irish retailers for all your online christmas shopping","story":"A number of Irish independent retailers describe how lockdowns and Covid restrictions have impacted their businesses - and what they’ve had to do to adapt. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish retailers are facing a tough Christmas with new Covid-19 restrictions closing non-essential outletsWe have been overwhelmed, in the best possible way, by the response to our original list, a few weeks ago, of 100 Irish websites where you can buy lovely, unique and good-value presents in the run-up to Christmas.Almost as soon as it appeared, business owners and many of their customers emailed us, tweeted us, sent us Instagram messages and contacted us on Facebook to champion more Irish companies doing the business online.That response matters, because we all know that the run-up to Christmas,\u0026nbspwith so many physical shops in lockdown,\u0026nbspis going to be incredibly hard for many businesses. It is also going to be a challenging time for shoppers, as they try to get organised for a Christmas like never before with more than 40 shopping days taken from them almost overnight.We know the problems all too well, but we know the solution, too, or at least part of it. The internet. But,\u0026nbspas we have said before and will say again,\u0026nbspshopping online comes with a caveat.

As we are learning, there are many, many local sites that need our support this month and every month. If we could keep just 10 or 20 per cent of our online spend this year at home it would inject tens of millions of euro into our local economies.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe first Covid-19 vaccinations could begin before the new year depending on approval from the European Medicines Agency, the Minister for Health said on Tuesday.Stephen Donnelly said: “It is possible that if the EMA does authorise this vaccine that an initial – it would be a very low level – but that an initial round of vaccination could actually begin before the new year”.The Minister’s comments came after the agency said it would seek to approve “if possible” the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine on December 21st, eight days earlier than planned.The committee was originally scheduled to convene on December 29th. The new date may shift forward the vaccination schedule for the EU by more than a week.The EU body said its human medicines committee (CHMP) had been “working intensively” to check data sent by the pharmaceutical companies over the past few weeks, and on Monday had received additional information it had requested.“Pending the outcome of its evaluation, an exceptional meeting of the CHMP has now been scheduled for December 21st to conclude if possible,” the agency said in a statement.In a statement to mark the publication of the report of the Government’s high level vaccination taskforce, Mr Donnelly said the vaccination programme would be rolled out in three phases.An initial rollout will be followed by a mass ramp-up and finally, open access. The highest priority groups – those over 65 in long-term care facilities, and frontline healthcare workers in direct contact with patients – will receive the vaccine first.“It will be bigger and more complex than previous vaccination programmes. It will play a central role in our exit from the pandemic”.He said over time, “it will allow us to return to reopen our society and to reconnect in the ways we once took for granted”.However, Mr Donnelly cautioned: “A vaccine won’t have a positive impact on the direct trajectory of this disease for at least months to come.”Dr Lorraine Nolan, the chief executive of the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), said that if the EMA made a positive decision on the Pfizer vaccine on the December 21st, it would be several days before a conditional marketing approval was granted, which would allow for the distribution of the vaccine. She said that could happen by the 23rd.“It will then take a number of days, potentially up to a week for the initial vaccination here,” Mr Donnelly said.Training materials would have to be developed for vaccinators which would take seven to ten days, Professor Brian MacCraith said. But this could not happen until the conditional marketing approval was granted, and that cannot be completed until the CMA is granted.Prof MacCraith, who chaired the taskforce, said there were a “number of unknowns” at the time the report was being written, including approval dates, delivery schedules and in some cases the specific characteristics of the vaccines.He said consequently there were some open issues on how the programme would be implemented. In addition to the two sites mentioned in the report as potential mass vaccination centres - Citywest and the National Exhibition Centre in Dublin - Prof MacCraith said he had held talks with the presidents of NUI Galway, Waterford Institute of Technology, the University of Limerick and UCC.Disease trajectoryDr Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer, struck a more cautious tone, welcoming the report and warning against misinformation, particularly online. He said, however, that the virus “doesn’t care that the vaccine is on the horizon”.He said that in “medical and technical terms”, the virus is just as big a danger to those who are infected as it was in March. “A vaccine won’t have a positive impact on the direct trajectory of this disease for at least months to come. And in the meantime, we need to continue to do all that we can to save lives now,” he said.Dr Holohan said the State is “actively planning” to vaccinate people in early 2021, but speakers at the launch repeatedly emphasised that the first consignments of the vaccine will be limited in scope and scale.Paul Reid, the chief executive of the HSE, said “it is widely expected that the delivery of volumes in the first phase will be smaller.” He said the HSE is establishing a plan for the workforce for administering the vaccine, and has selected an IT provider - a joint venture of IBM and Salesforce - to administer the “digital process” underpinning the rollout. That system will cover making appointments, the administration of the shots needed, and ongoing monitoring and reporting after vaccination, he said.A backup IT system, Healthlink, which currently manages GP referrals, would be ready to support the first wave of vaccinations if the full system was not ready to deploy. “If it’s not ready we have a backup solution that will work. So we won’t be delaying the rollout”, he said.Mr Reid said the HSE was working on a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) of the project, and was in dialogue with the Data Protection Commissioner.In addition to trained vaccinators, GPs, pharmacists and other medical professionals, recent retirees may play a role in administering the vaccine, as might the national ambulance service, he said, adding that the HSE would be engaging with GP and pharmacist representative bodies. Some 26 private nursing homes will be part of the first deployment, he said.The news conference heard that the first batch of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines would be produced in Belgium, before being shipped from Karlsruhe to the State’s central cold storage facility in Citywest, where ultra low temperature freezers have been installed. Mr Donnelly said he did not anticipate Brexit impacting on the delivery of the vaccines “at all”. The first phases of rollout will be on a “hub and spoke” model, done by mobile units or through hospitals.Adverse reactionsAsked about the potential for adverse incidents and associate legal actions, Dr Nolan said an “absolute guarantee” that the vaccines would be risk free is “simply not possible”.“We know this vaccine will have the typical profile of any vaccine and we can expect there will be effects,” she said, adding they would be mild. She said that moving from clinical trials to real world use of the vaccine, however, “you have to be open to the possibility that that widespread use and that scale may show up rare effects that the clinical trials haven’t shown”.Dr Holohan said he hoped that daily updates on the number of people vaccinated would be issued next year, along with the daily case numbers.In his statement, Mr Donnelly said: “Today is a really positive day for all of us. After a very difficult year, we are hopefully that Covid-19 vaccines will be approved for use in Ireland in a matter of weeks.”Mr Donnelly thanked Prof MacCraith for his work on the strategy, which he said was the result of close co-operation between the Department of Health, the HSE and other stakeholders.Vaccines will be administered from long-term care facilities, mass vaccination clinics, GP surgeries and community pharmacies, and will be carried out by trained healthcare workers.The Minister said Ireland had largely avoided a significant rise in ICU admissions and many deaths due to its pre-emptive action in recent months, but that Covid-19 is “still out there”.“Cases of Covid-19 have crept up again in recent days, and so we must all be careful,” he said.Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Tuesday the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines would in part be determined by drug companies’ capacity to produce doses, as well as authorisation timelines.Mr Martin told reporters before Cabinet on Tuesday morning that the rollout of the State’s immunisation “all depends on the manufacturing capacity within the various companies, and the timing of the various vaccines getting authorisation”. He said the timing was “very much subject” to these factors.Mr Martin said earlier this week that the “optimal” time for administering the inoculations would not be until late spring, tempering expectations that the rollout will quickly follow the approval of the first vaccine by regulators, which is expected before the end of the year.Up to 14 million doses may be purchased by the State, depending on whether a sixth advanced purchase agreement is signed off by the EU with drug company Sanofi.Sources have said the cost of the drugs will be about €112 million.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4436515.1607963594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"paying 15c more for a loaf after brexit irish bakeries eye flour beyond britain","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael McCambridge, managing director of McCambridge’s, says they are pointing more towards the EU for anything they can get in the future rather than defaulting to the UK. Photograph: Nick BradshawIrish bakeries have stockpiled flour, sourced alternative supplies from Europe and sought ways to minimise tariffs on British flour in preparation for a potential collapse in EU-UK trade talks. About half the flour used by Irish bakers comes from England with the other half sourced from three mills on the island of Ireland – Allied Mills and Andrews Flour in Belfast and Odlums in Portarlington, Co Laois. These mills have limited capacity to substitute for supply from English mills.The large proportion of flour coming from Britain could mean heavy tariffs on imports, €172 per tonne, or an increase of 35-40 per cent on the cost of flour imports under a no-deal scenario. Increased costs could be passed on to consumers, adding up to 15 cent to a loaf of bread. Under no-deal contingency planning, Irish bakeries have sought to open new supply lines from continental Europe, sourcing flour from Germany and France. “The fear of the year ending without an agreement has risen so no-deal planning across the board is really switched on,” said Alex Waugh, director of the National Association of British and Irish Flour Millers.The large quantities of flour required by bakeries – about 4,000 tonnes of flour are imported into the Republic from the UK every week – means there is limited capacity to stockpile ahead of World Trade Organisation tariffs applying if there is no trade deal by January 1st. “There would be efforts that the silos are fully stocked by the end of the transition period,” said Linda Stuart-Trainor, director of prepared consumer foods at industry group Food Drink Ireland.“For product categories that use a lot of flour, that can only get them so far because of the volume of space and the way it is stored, they cannot store too much of it in advance.”Turning to EuropeShe estimates that about 30 per cent of grocery products contain flour. Irish firms have had to turn to Europe to reduce reliance on UK-imported flour.“Every company has certainly looked at it. We would still intend to import large quantities of flour from the UK in the short term. Maybe in the longer term, things may evolve,” she said.Buying flour from French and German mills carries additional costs.“That is a perfectly sensible thing to do but we shouldn’t kid ourselves that that means that nothing changes. The cost of freight is quite high so it is not cost neutral,” said Mr Waugh.Michael McCambridge, managing director of Dublin bakery McCambridge’s, buys packaging in the UK for which he has “a hedge” until June to give him time to find other sources. “We are pointing more towards the EU for anything we can get in the future rather than defaulting to the UK,” he said. UK mills are looking at milling EU wheat which, Mr Waugh estimates, could shave €100 off the per-tonne tariff on exported British flour.Large amounts of baked goods made with British flour are sold back into the UK so some in the industry believe customs arrangements can be put in place. “You could get relief on your tariffs. It is not as simple as saying that there is going to be €172 a tonne and no supply,” said an industry source.Costs could be passed on to the price of a loaf of bread with tariffs.“The likelihood is that there will be an inflationary impact,” said Mr Waugh.Mr McCambridge said the pandemic might not make this inevitable.“Whether the price of a loaf of bread will rise is another issue because of the competitive issues in the marketplace between retailer and bakery,” he said.“Given the economic situation with pandemic unemployment, all the retailers are quite correctly focusing on value.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) is to oppose the proposed new public service pay agreement. The TUI leadership said “the limited measures contained in the proposed agreement will not end the ongoing scandal of pay discrimination for second level teachers employed on or after 1st January 2011.”It also maintained the proposed new deal and would not address the two-tier pay issue at all for the other recruitment grades in which TUI represented members. The TUI executive unanimously recommended that members should reject the new public service agreement proposals in a forthcoming ballot. Meanwhile the executive of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors (AGSI) on Tuesday unanimously criticised the process that led to the proposed new public service agreement. It said that promises that there would be parity of esteem between groups affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and those outside the body in the negotiations with the Government had not been adhered to. It said it was not part of the group that negotiated the new proposals. The AGSI did not comment on the content of the deal but is concentrating at present on th process involved in its negotiation. It said while it was being briefed on the new agreement , its representatives were reading the details in the media. Earlier on Tuesday the Government and two of the larger public service unions backed the proposed new accord for State employees. The Cabinet formally approved the proposed €906 million deal on Tuesday while the executive committees of the primary teachers’ union, the INTO, and the largest public service union Fórsa said they would urge members to support the proposals in forthcoming ballots.Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the agreement provided for “affordable pay adjustments weighted toward those on lower incomes”. He said the proposed agreement also set out a reform agenda which sought to “embed the agility demonstrated during Covid into enhanced public service delivery in the future”. The Minister said the deal sought to move beyond the era of austerity and “to provide a new basis for managing public pay and industrial relations in a sustainable and balanced way”.The Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said on Tuesday it expected an overall decision on whether unions will ratify or reject the proposed agreement on February 15th. It said inidual unions would commence balloting members on the proposals early in the new year. Difficult backgroundThe overall decision on whether to ratify the proposed new deal will be based on a weighted aggregate of the outcomes of the ballots of its inidual affiliate unions. The chairman of the Public Services Committee, Kevin Callinan, who is also general secretary of Fórsa, said the proposed new deal represented a positive short-term package, negotiated against a difficult background, to build on the momentum of recent pay restoration and public service flexibility and service quality.He said the proposals were substantially weighted towards lower-income civil and public servants, and had achieved solid progress on the priorities unions had set at the outset of the talks. Under the new proposals, most public service personnel would receive a 1 per cent pay rise in October 2021 and another in October 2022. Teaching entrantsThe equivalent of another 1 per cent, €237 million, will be earmarked for sectoral bargaining to deal with awards and claims in particular parts of the public service. Alternatively it could be used to increase pay for all in a particular sector. The INTO said its central executive committee (CEC) would urge its 42,000 members to back the proposals. It said it welcomed moves in the proposed deal to address lower pay arrangements for more recent entrants to teaching. “The CEC welcomes the commitment that post-2010 entrants to teaching will skip point 12 of the payscale, thereby ensuring that those who graduated from 2011 to 2014 and who suffered the most from pay inequality, will have no future losses. The additional increment skip begins on March 1st, 2021, for the first cohort who entered the profession nearly 10 years previously and restores the length of the teachers’ salary scale to 24 points. ““The Central Executive Committee has committed to use the lion’s share of the 1 per cent quantum of primary teachers’ payroll dedicated to sectoral bargaining within the proposed agreement to deliver long-awaited increases in salaries for primary school leaders by February 1st, 2022,” the INTO said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4437593.1608056363!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in td apologises for tweets stressing homophobia is abhorrent","story":"After a week away from politics at the request of party leader Mary Lou McDonald the Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley has attended a sitting of the Dáil and apologised for two separate tweets.

Image: Oireachtas TVSinn Féin TD Brian Stanley has apologised in the Dáil following controversies over two separate tweets.Mr Stanley, head of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said he was “committed to learning” from his mistakes, and stressed on the question of one controversial tweet about Leo Varadkar that “homophobia is abhorrent to me”.Mr Stanley took a week away from politics at the request of party leader Mary Lou McDonald. He also deleted his social media accounts following criticisms of two separate messages.Less than 24 hours after apologising for that tweet, Mr Stanley was forced to defend himself against alleged homophobia in a tweet posted on the day Mr Varadkar became Fine Gael leader in 2017.In that message Mr Stanley wrote “yippee 4 d tory. it’s Leo. U can do what u like in bed but don’t look 4 a pay rise the next morning.”Regarding the Kilmichael tweet, Mr Stanley said it was insensitive and caused upset and anger “and for that I am truly sorry”.Mr Stanley said “we need to be able to talk about the past in a way that doesn’t cause ision, deepen ision. We must be sensitive in how we talk about the past and be respectful of the views that others may hold about the past that may be different.”In his tweet about Mr Varadkar in 2017, he said “the point I was trying to make was that’s great” that someone who was gay was elected “but let’s also focus on workers’ rights and rights of people on low income and economic justice,” he said.“I accept that it was a point I did not articulate in a very good way and that the tweet was open to different interpretations.“Homophobia is abhorrent to me,” he added.“I did try to contact the Tánaiste today to express my apology personally and I will do so again, after this.”Mr Stanley said “I hope that those I’ve hurt accept my apologies and that my colleagues accept the sincerity of my statement.”He added: “I own my own mistakes and the hurt that I caused. I’m at fault and I’m responsible for the accusations that have been levelled at me.“I’m committed to learning from these mistakes and be sure of this to work even harder to promote the causes of equality, inclusion understanding and reconciliation.”Before he started Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said that under Dáil rules “no debate or statements by other members can arise in the aftermath of Deputy Stanley’s contribution”.Meanwhile members of the Oireachtas public petitions committee are due to decide this afternoon whether to meet on Thursday to hear from Sinn Féin TD Martin Browne about a recent interview with Tipp FM.Mr Browne was forced to adjourn the first official meeting of the committee last Thursday after members called on him to explain comments about the IRA and party discipline.The Tipperary TD said that apologies “should stop” when asked about IRA killings during the Troubles and Sinn Féin’s approach to their remembrance.In the wake of former Sinn Féin member Christine O’Mahony leaving the party after a member called to her door to ask her to remove critical tweets, Mr Browne also said he had gone to the homes of members with whom he disagreed.Separately, Mr Browne apologised for sharing controversial Facebook posts in recent years, including one pushing a conspiracy theory that the 911 attacks in the United States were faked.An index of selected articles available exclusively to our readers with an  digital subscription "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4437803.1608065502!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu and uk under pressure to seal trade deal this week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels. Photograph: John ThysAFP via GettyThe UK and the European Union are in a race to conclude talks by the end of the week, after which implementation of any accord in time to avoid disruption on January 1st is seen as difficult.Progress is inching forwards between the negotiating teams led by Michel Barnier and David Frost, sources close to the talks said, but with serious differences still remaining on the outstanding issues of fisheries and how to ensure fair competition.Both negotiating teams view the fact that talks are ongoing as a positive sign. But the remaining differences are those that have been hardest to overcome, and negotiators are locked in talks in Brussels to try to avoid a trade shock in just over a fortnight.UK prime minister Boris Johnson briefed his cabinet on Tuesday that the talks were still “most likely” to end without a deal, and that his administration wanted an agreement but not at “any cost”, the BBC reported.The Irish Government is more hopeful, with officials believing the path to a deal is possible and that both sides’ willingness to keep talking despite missing a deadline last Sunday reflects political will for an accord.With so little time remaining, discussion has turned to whether ratification of any deal by the UK and European Parliaments could be held after January 1st. But ideas of provisionally applying the accord or creating a “bridging” arrangement are seen as legally and politically challenging.The European Commission has warned that this could be a period of no-deal until an agreement is approved, meaning a few weeks in which member states would legally be required as members of the World Trade Organisation to levy tariffs, with additional widespread disruption as legal arrangements dissolve overnight.Legal risksLeader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said a deal could theoretically be ratified after it came into force, but that this would involve significant legal risks due to the gap between domestic and international law.“If both sides accept that ratification is done in a different way, that is theoretically possible,” Mr Rees-Mogg said when asked about the issue on a ConservativeHome podcast.The European Parliament has piled on the pressure for a conclusion, with prominent MEPs warning that unless they have the text of a deal to examine by the end of the week they may refuse to vote on it by the end of the year, in a demand for more time to scrutinise the details.German MEP Bernd Lange, who chairs the parliament’s trade committee, described a decision to extend talks as “irresponsible and bitter” and said that “serious ratification is becoming increasingly impossible”.The outstanding differences centre on Britain’s demand to claw back most of the €650 million in fish caught by EU boats in its waters annually and determine access in annual quota talks, and how to manage ergence between the two regulatory systems to ensure fair competition.There were reports that negotiations on Erasmus+ had concluded unsuccessfully and that students in the UK would be locked out of the popular exchange programme, but this was denied by sources close to the talks.“Negotiations with the EU are ongoing. It would not be appropriate for us to pre-empt the outcome of these discussions,” a UK government spokeswoman said. Britain is, however, preparing a contingency plan of a domestic UK-wide Erasmus programme in case negotiations are unsuccessful.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4437625.1608065739!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mitch mcconnell congratulates joe biden on us election victory","story":"Senior Republicans recognised Joe Biden as the president-elect of the United States on Tuesday as President Donald Trump continued to deny the outcome of the election. In a significant break with the president, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell congratulated Mr Biden and vice-president-elect Kamala Harris on their victory, a day after the electoral college confirmed the election result.“As of this morning our country has officially a president-elect and a vice-president-elect,” Mr McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Many of us hoped that the presidential election would yield a different result, but our system of government has processes to determine who will be sworn in on January 20th. The electoral college has spoken. Today I want to congratulate president-elect Joe Biden.”Mr McConnell also congratulated Ms Harris, a colleague in the Senate. “Beyond our differences, Americans can take pride that our nation has a female vice president-elect for the very first time,” he said. Mr Biden phoned the majority leader to thank him, he confirmed afterwards, describing it as a “good conversation”.Though much of his speech praised the achievements of the Trump presidency, including Republicans’ success in confirming hundreds of conservative judges to federal courts, Mr McConnell’s definitive recognition of the election outcome is a blow to Mr Trump’s efforts to change the result. Minutes after Mr McConnell spoke, Mr Trump indicated that he was showing no signs of conceding to Mr Biden however, tweeting: “Tremendous evidence pouring in on voter fraud. There has never been anything like this in our Country!”Mr McConnell’s statement followed an acknowledgement by several senior Republicans that Mr Biden had won the election. On Monday, Mr Biden passed a key procedural hurdle in his path to the White House, when state electors across the country voted to confirm him as president. The development, though typically a procedural formality, prompted several Republican senators to break with the president. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Mr Trump, said that Mr Biden was the president-elect, and confirmed that he had spoken to Mr Biden by phone. Others such as Chuck Grassley and John Thune also said that the election was now over. The move by Senate Republicans to acknowledge Mr Biden’s victory is a belated recognition of a political reality ever since Mr Biden won the required number of electoral college votes more than five weeks ago. Russian president Vladimir Putin also congratulated the US president-elect, weeks after most other countries had done so.House Republicans – more than a hundred of whom supported an ill-fated lawsuit brought by Texas to the supreme court seeking to overturn the result in four other states – have been less willing to acknowledge the election result.Mr Trump, however, seemed as defiant as ever, tweeting unfounded conspiracy theories about election fraud several times on Tuesday. He also tweeted a Breitbart News article about Alabama congressman Mo Brooks, who has suggested he could question the electoral college vote when it comes to Congress for ratification on January 6th.Addressing the nation on Monday night, after the electoral college declared he had won the election with 306 electoral college votes, Mr Biden said that “once again in America, the rule of law, our constitution, and the will of the people have prevailed”.“Our democracy – pushed, tested, threatened – proved to be resilient, true and strong.”He said that recent threats to election workers were “unconscionable”. He also hit out at Mr Trump’s efforts to overturn the election result, noting that the president himself also won the 2016 election with 306 electoral votes. “By his own standards, these numbers represented a clear victory then – and I respectfully suggest they do so now.”Mr Biden travelled to Georgia on Tuesday to campaign for the two Democratic candidates running in a pair of run-off elections in the state on January 5th. Should both win, Democrats will control 50 seats in the 100-seat chamber, with vice-president Kamala Harris holding a tie-breaking vote.US presidential election: Read more of our coverage of the transition to the Biden White HouseStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Moscow capable of second Salisbury-style poisoning that could kill thousands in UK, Defence Secretary warnsMan who ‘expressed affinity with’ incel-motivated mass murderer found guilty under Terrorism Act in ‘unprecedented’ caseSNP accused of presiding over ‘national tragedy’ as Scotland reports highest number of drug-related deaths on recordClimate lawyer faces jail after tweeting outcome of Heathrow Airport third runway judgementMI6 failed to tell Foreign Secretary about rogue agent involved in \u0026#39serious criminality\u0026#39MPs primed to vote for a potential Brexit trade deal next weekSocial media firms whose sites are accessed by under 13s will face multimillion pound finesPalm Beach average age drops rapidly as lockdown-weary New York families flee to Florida Mass testing to be rolled out at secondary schools in JanuaryTest and release firms ‘overwhelmed’ by travellers as Government accused of underestimating demandHalf of carers too worried about Covid to risk seeing loved ones this ChristmasMiddle-class girls groomed by gangs being overlooked by police because of victim stereotypesComment: Sorry politicians, but if you think you can cancel Christmas, you\u0026#39re sadly mistakenFounder of \u0026#39wellness latte\u0026#39 company backed by Duchess of Sussex is daughter of wealthy businessmanScotland lockdown: what are the new Covid rules and Tier 4 restrictions?Nicola Sturgeon warns she could toughen up her tiers as she increases restrictions in three areas Canadian fashion designer Peter Nygard arrested on sex trafficking chargesCovid variant has high number of mutations but there is ‘no evidence’ it is more severeMan is jailed for travelling to the Isle of Man by Jet Ski to see his girlfriendSenior White House staff to get Covid-19 vaccine soon to ensure \u0026#39continuity of government\u0026#39Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could area also see new lockdown tier week use postcode tool","story":"London and swathes of the South East of England will be placed into the Government\u0027s toughest lockdown tier from Wednesday - but many elsewhere in the country are still in the dark about the local coronavirus rules they will face in the run-up to Christmas.Residents of areas like Manchester or Kent are keen to know whether their Tier 3 restrictions could be loosened, while those in Cornwall — one of just two Tier 1 local authority areas — fear a tightening of rules as Covid-19 spreads across the South. While no decision has been announced for the rest of England yet, the Government has previously published the exact datasets ministers are examining when deciding on what lockdown tier to place areas in. Use our postcode tool below to see if your area is heading in the right or wrong direction on these key Covid-19 metrics. Some areas are seeing clear signs of positive progress under England\u0027s tier system, raising the possibility of a loosening of lockdown.  York, currently under Tier 2, has not only seen its case rate drop well below the Tier 3 and Tier 2 averages to just 57.9 per 100,000, but also witnessed a clear reduction in infections among the over-60s as well as declining hospital admissions since the beginning of December.Likewise, parts of Greater Manchester — a region plagued by local lockdowns throughout the summer and then Tier 3 just before the November national lockdown — are seeing good performance on their metrics.  Wigan, for example, is seeing a decline in the share of swabs coming back positive, an important indicator for assessing whether testing is keeping up with the spread of cases. Prospects for other areas are less promising. Though Liverpool was moved down from Tier 3 at the beginning of September, its case rate still remains above the Tier 2 average, and its metrics are beginning to tick back up again.These numbers pale in comparison to some of the case spikes seen in the areas placed into Tier 3 from Wednesday. Basildon in Essex - one of the areas we know will be placed into a tougher tier this week - currently has the third highest case rate in England — at 562.5 per 100,000 people — and is 1.6 times higher than when national lockdown ended.Its rate among the over-60s, however, is half that of the worst affected areas of the country, at 251.2 per 100,000. While hospital occupancy and admission rates remain low in Basildon, the case positivity rate sits at 12.3 per cent — much higher than the five per cent the World Health Organisation considers to be appropriate to catch the vast majority of cases.Other hard-hit areas in Essex include Brentwood and Thurrock, where case rates are high and rising fast — currently at more than 360 per 100,000.The worst-affected London boroughs include Havering, Barking and Dagenham, Waltham Forest, Redbridge and Newham.The case positivity rate — the percentage of tests that come back positive — is above 11 per cent in each borough, and the case rate above 300 per 100,000.Havering is currently faring worst in the city with a case rate of 470.8 per 100,000, having risen to 1.5 times the rate when it emerged from national lockdown. The case positivity rate in the borough is 12.5 per cent - among the highest in the country — and hospital occupancy rates standing at above 20 per 100,000.However, London is not spread evenly. In Richmond-upon-Thames the case rate is considerably lower at 115.1 per 100,000, and 4.2 per cent of tests are returning positive.The over-60s rate is half that in the general population in Richmond, and hospital occupancy and admission rates are below the national average.In Southwark and Lambeth, the case positivity rate is below five per cent, and overall case rates below 200 per 100,000.Both boroughs are also seeing some of the lowest hospital admission rates in the country - at 0.2 per 100,000 in Southwark and 0.3 in Lambeth.Of the areas currently subject to the harshest restrictions, many hope to see restrictions relaxed for the final weeks of 2020.They include Stratford-upon-Avon, where the district council recently dropped its threat of legal action after a government response.The case rate in the area is now just 65.3 per 100,000, and only 2.1 per cent of tests are now returning positive.After the whole of Derbyshire was put into Tier 3 restrictions, the Dales in particular could have the strongest case for leniency at this week\u0027s review. The latest case rate is 76 per 100,000 and falling, with a rate among the over 60s lower still, at 43.9.Higher than average hospital occupancy rates in the Derbyshire Dales could pose a problem, at 13.5 per 100,000 and an admission rate of 1.4 per 100,000.Based on an average score across all metrics used by the Government in deciding tier risk, local authorities currently in Tier 3 which are faring better with Covid include Gateshead, Trafford, Tameside, Rushcliffe and Fylde.If any additional areas manage to move into Tier 1, the lightest restrictions, candidates include areas of the South West - South Hams, Plymouth, Dorset and Torbay.Adur and Worthing, in West Sussex, are also seeing some of the lowest Covid prevalence rates.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can trust government not perform another last minute u turn","story":"Christmas can be a nightmare at the best of times. Carefully crafted plans, good intentions and high expectations swirl until the critical point when Uncle Pete is drunk, the turkey is drier than the Sahara, sprouts have become projectiles and Grandad wants to hit the road before the weather sets in. For parents up and down the country, as they wake on Boxing day with a thumping head to survey a kitchen that resembles a dystopian apocalypse movie, the question of whether the eye-watering cost and sheer logistical operation required was all worth it hangs in the air with the scent of gravy and pine.Now the nightmare before Christmas has become a Russian roulette of delicate negotiations with the added threat of Government yuletide U-turns while working out how to combine cross-tiered relatives, whether a turkey crown will suffice and who deserves a hallowed place setting complete with tinselled deely-boppers. Normally at this point bookies are lining up bets on a White Christmas. This year, odds on Downing Street decision-making must be longer than meteorological guesswork. Normally by mid December we have bemoaned the ever-rotating playlist of dire Christmas classics and premature arrival of naff street lights and chocolate coins for at least a month, festive fixtures that seem awkwardly juxtaposed with the chaos of a Covid Christmas. For some reading this, a normal, nuclear family nativity may be safely beyond the reach of whatever stuffing Sage has in store. Yet for others, there is a very human toll. Isolated elderly relatives worried that it may be the last time they can live vicariously through boisterous grandchildren. For others, for whom Christmas represents an annual migration for a family feast, train and plane tickets and portable presents must be procured while spare bedrooms are spruced up and boughs of spruces laden with gifts for all. Despite having been promised repeatedly that sacrifice today means Christmas tomorrow, the Government remains tight-lipped over whether they will play the part of Grinch. How many times this year have we heard the Government swear blind that it will stick to its guns, only to backslide at the last minute?There was the return to school, pushed back from June to September with, along the way, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson swearing blind fealty to his grade-determining algorithm only to abandon it days later. How about the promise that we wouldn\u0027t have a second national lockdown or the rapid collapse of the fabled air bridges in the summer?There is an obvious dilemma for festive Brits whose faith in the Government to stay the course is waning. Christmas plans are being made. Train tickets are booked and turkeys big enough to feed a three-household gathering have been bought. The Prime Minister\u0027s usual gambit of waiting until the absolute last minute before executing a screeching U-turn would be more infuriating than ever if he were to flip flop just days (or even hours) before the start of the Christmas window. The washy responses given to journalists asking about the possibility of changes to the rules are enough to raise a chill of fear that this is exactly what may yet be in the offing.Having spent the most part of 2020 terrorised, incarcerated and grotesquely man-handled by Government overreach,  Christmas should be a time when people are given the basic tenets of freedom and privacy, and told to apply their own agency to familial festivities. Just like novelty Christmas jumpers for the Amazon-enabled present-swapping, one size rarely fits all.Christmas number one could have been the shared joy of washing of our hands to Jingle Bells, toasting Matt Hancock’s press conference special behind a tinsel-strewn lectern while Professor Whitty, complete with Santa hat, reminds us that toys must be quarantined for 72 hours before being shared. For what is a British Christmas without a litany of things to wistfully denigrate every year?It’s time the Government realised that the magic of Christmas is not tinsel, turkey and toys, but sharing the good, and the bad, with our nearest and dearest. We need to be allowed to spread a little humanity and make memories this Covid Christmas, as a one-off we can remember.

Mr McLachlan has always denied all the allegations against him.The charges related to allegations Mr McLachlan touched a woman\u0027s genitals while she was performing in a scene and he was hidden from the audience and that he forcefully pushed her face in another scene that he put his tongue in the mouth of a second woman during an unscripted kiss and that he pushed his groin into her during a backstage hug that he twice kissed a third woman backstage, and that he ran his hand up a fourth woman\u0027s leg while she was performing and he was concealed from the audience.Magistrate Belinda Wallington said it was likely Mr McLachlan touched the women while they were performing, but might have believed they were consenting due to his “egotistical, self-entitled sense of humour”.She wanted it known the four complainants were brave and honest witnesses. She rejected Mr McLachlan\u0027s suggestions the women colluded against him.Ms Wallington said she was not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt he knew they were not consenting, which is an element of the particular charges he faced.The magistrate held that the kisses and hug backstage and the face push on stage all happened, but she was not convinced they constituted an indecent assault or common assault.Mr McLachlan, 55, sat with his partner, Vanessa Scammell, in a Sydney hotel as they watched a video link of Ms Wallington delivering her verdicts from the Melbourne Magistrates Court.Several hours later, Mr McLachlan and Ms Scammell emerged from the hotel, where he told local media they would “have a lot to say” in the new year.“We have maintained a dignified and respectful silence for the past almost three years and put our trust in the law.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gifts undelivered food delivery slots fully booked devastating","story":"The turkey has been ordered, the tickets booked and the presents are waiting to be placed under the Christmas tree for the joyous family gathering.Families up and down the country have made all the necessary arrangements for a perfect festive reunion with loved ones they have not seen in months because of coronavirus restrictions on gatherings.But all that careful planning could now be thrown into chaos by the prospect of the Government rescinding its promise to grant families permission to mix more freely for five days over Christmas.Last month ministers announced plans for “Christmas bubbles” of up to three households of any size, allowing people to travel around freely from 23 to 27 December, irrespective of what local tier of Covid restrictions they live in. Any U-turn on this would have far reaching consequences across the retail, travel and hospitality sector and could see thousands of rail, coach and airline passengers clamouring for refunds if their journeys to family gatherings are effectively banned.Shoppers who have stocked up on food and drink in anticipation of relatives descending on them for Christmas will be forced to cancel orders or end up with far more leftovers on their hands than anticipated.And many others may find themselves unable to hand over presents they did not post, after banking on seeing their loved ones face to face. The deadline for second-class Christmas mail has already passed and people have only until Monday to post items first class in time, with delays in deliveries already predicted due to increased demand.Andy Mulcahy of IMRG, the trade body for online retailers, said: “Unless people have already posted their presents it\u0027s highly unlikely their parcels will arrive in time. The Royal Mail is already experiencing problems coping with the demand and queues at Post Offices go round the block.”Then there is the question of shopping for Christmas dinner. Online delivery slots for the Christmas period became fully booked weeks ago, leaving anyone previously relying on their parents or other relatives hosting the meal in danger of missing out.Tesco had already laid on 1.5 million delivery slots a week, compared to 600,000 before the pandemic, but the vast majority of these for the Christmas period have already gone.“There are simply no delivery slots left, with demand already outstripping supply this year,” said Mr Mulcahy. “If you are relying on relatives to make Christmas dinner for everyone and suddenly find you are having to make it yourself for your immediate family you’re going to hit problems getting any shopping delivered online.”Millions have already been spent on additional travel measures in anticipation of families crossing the country to be with each other – with much of that redundant if the five days of relaxed gatherings are scrapped, with the added impact of forcing passengers to apply for refunds.As recently as last Friday, the Department for Transport announced a support package worth up to £3 million that will enable coach operators to provide additional scheduled services over the Christmas travel window.At the same time Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, announced that 778 of miles of roadworks will be lifted to allow for easier driving conditions over the Christmas period and rail upgrades postponed to allow for extra services, with over 95 per cent of the rail network to be left unaffected by engineering works.The Rail Delivery Group, which represents Britain’s rail companies, said: “We have scaled up our service where possible to help people travel over those five days. If the Government tells people they can’t now travel we would try to scale down those plans.“For people who wouldn’t be able to travel we would offer either a refund or a voucher for the cost of their tickets.”Scrapping the five-day Christmas bubbles would also have a further devastating impact on the hospitality industry, already reeling from the re-imposition of Tier 3 status in London and much of the country.Marcos Fernandez, MD Arros QD \u0026amp Iberica, said: “Christmas is the only chance for those restaurants that have managed to survive to make the cash to get them through the rest of winter.”Rik Campbell, co-founder of the Kricket collection of modern Indian restaurants, added: “Christmas and New Year were already looking bleak, and now we’re staring down the barrel.”Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK Hospitality, said: “There is a sense across much of the sector that things can’t really get much worse. Scrapping the bubble won’t improve the outlook for restaurants or pubs, though. “With household mixing indoors at Tier 2 banned, venues are not even in a position to welcome customers for Christmas dinner if they can’t visit their friends or family. Even though big, spacious, well-ventilated venues are probably the safest indoor option for people to celebrate.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sorry politicians think can cancel christmas sadly mistaken","story":"Christmas. To cancel or not to cancel? That is the absurd dilemma currently preoccupying our politicians, as though the fairy-lit juggernaut that is December 25 could actually be stopped, Santa’s sleigh clamped, and every twinkling tree axed at the dead of night.But regardless of any urgent new decision taken on the hop by our in-out hokey cokey Cabinet, Time and Yuletide wait for no man. Among believers and non-Christians alike, Christmas has a momentum all of its own and is the culmination of not just hopes and dreams, but months of planning and frantic phone calls.It can’t simply be abolished or postponed.According to the AA, eight million of us intend to travel to see loved ones more than half taking to the roads on Christmas Eve. The same survey revealed that 46 per cent of us intended to get all our shopping done and dusted in short order, something we were specifically told to do. Remember?“Shop early, start wrapping, enjoy Christmas” the  British Retail Consortium urged us in October.The Post Office went for an even more emphatic approach: “Please post items for Christmas early,” its website still says. “Ongoing Covid restrictions, reduced air and freight capacity, high volumes and winter weather conditions are all impacting transportation and local delivery across the globe.”Despite a year of chaos, confusion and broken promises, we followed the advice and duly scrambled about getting ready, stocking up, and sending ahead. The Rail Delivery Group reports a significant uptick in people buying long-distance rail tickets (often at huge expense) after the Government announced up to three households of any size can mix, allowing people to travel around freely from December 23 to 27, irrespective of what local tier of Covid-19 restrictions they live in. Now that has been placed in jeopardy as though it were no big deal.But December 25 is “just a day only in the way the UEFA Champions League final is “just a match”. A 2016 study commissioned by Scottish Widows revealed the average woman spends 33 hours (or four working days) preparing for Christmas every year. Much is made of Christmas magic. But every magician understands the graft, grit and heroic amount of groundwork that goes into creating a spectacle that enchants and delights everyone in the room.And that was in the olden days when festive bubbles referred to the Prosecco rather than the personnel drinking it. This year has required even more emotionally fraught, elaborately thought-through arrangements. Millions of British families have been at it on and off since Boris announced we could have a normal (ish) Christmas. Plans have been drawn up, endlessly discussed every detail drilled into and nailed down with military precision.Families are waiting to welcome back fledged students returning to the nest in need of fresh laundry and a decent meal. Relatives are looking forward to arriving on familial doorsteps for the first time all year the old starved of their grandchildren since March finally getting rare access to the noise, laughter and energy of the very young. To throw all of this up in the air now is unthinkable singletons who have struggled through lockdown living alone and working on a laptop from the sofa have never craved their childhood beds more.Are we now to tell a much-loved grandmother she is no longer invited? Who will organise a hot Christmas meal for her on the big day? Tesco had already laid on 1.5 million delivery slots a week, but most of these for the Christmas period have already gone. Shoppers who have stocked up on food and drink in anticipation of relatives descending on them for Christmas will be forced to cancel orders or end up stranded at home with an empty fridge when the goose and trimmings are on the other side of the country, languishing uneaten.Many others will find themselves unable to hand over presents they did not post, after banking on seeing their loved ones face to face. The deadline for second class Christmas mail has already passed and people have only till Monday to post items first class in time, with delays in deliveries already predicted due to increased demand.Online retailers warn unless people have already posted their presents it\u0027s highly unlikely parcels will arrive in time. The Royal Mail is already experiencing problems coping and queues at Post Offices go round the block.How on earth do you explain the absence of gifts to distraught children and the absence of kids to the heartbroken grandparents?Every variation of disappointment and consternation makes for a miserable, lonely, scenario and all of it because we naively believed Boris Johnson et al when they assured us Christmas 2020 would go ahead.Christmas is the non-negotiable punctuation of the year, bound up in ritual and tradition, when kith and kin gather to do what they always do.But now it all hangs in the balance. It’s hard not to feel foolish. Impossible not to feel furious. Of course, nobody wants to take unnecessary risks with the health of elderly or vulnerable family and friends. We must remain vigilant, but most will have already factored this in.In a year like no other, a family Christmas has never felt more crucial. It simply cannot be cancelled now. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas bubble coronavirus rules full","story":"NewsChristmas bubble coronavirus rules in full - what you can and can’t doThe special rules will let people under the toughest lockdowns see their families for a short time -they arent torn up in a U-turnmirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-outlines-uks-christmas-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Three households will be able to join together under one roof in an exclusive ‘Christmas bubble’ for five days UK-wide, between December -. Bubbles can gather in private homes, outdoor public spaces, or places of worship together - but not the pub. The new rules will let many people who are under the toughest Covid rules see their families for the only time before Easter. But after a surge in coronavirus cases, ministers from the four nations were planning to revisit the rules in a possible U-turn.In the weeks after the bubble system was announced, Tory ministers and medical experts lined up to urge people not to take full advantage of it. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty urged people not to hug elderly relativesyou want them to survive to be hugged again. And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay urged families to do the minimum amount of socialising necessary. Boris Johnson suggested people were only allowed to see family in the first place “they’re frankly going to doanyway”. Soyou do choose to see your family, what do the current rules look like   Here’s a quick guide. The following guidance applies to England, and most of the rules apply to the whole UK too. However there are some slight iations for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.What are the ‘Christmas bubble’ rules  England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are have dferent sets of local or national lockdown rules through December. This includes a ban on socialising indoors with anyone who isnapost in your household or bubble for almost the entire population of England . Under a Christmas plan, these will essentially be suspended for five days for the purposes of family gatherings and replaced with one set of national, UK-wide rules. This is designed to stop people breaking the rules anyway and criminalising family gatherings. Up to three households will be legally allowed to create a ‘Christmas bubble’ temporarily for a number of days. Everyone in the bubble can stay in any of those three people’s houses, and go to outdoor public spaces like parks and places of worship together. This will be strictly time limited and last between December  and  inclusive. You must be back home in your normal household by midnight on the th - you can’t stay overnight into the th. . Crucially, each Christmas bubble will be “fixed” and exclusive - you can’t be in more than one Christmas bubble. That means you can’t go to your mates’ house for a booze-up on Christmas Eve, followed by smoked salmon with family on Christmas Day. Why are the rules being reviewed   After the rules were agreed, cases began rising exponentially in London and parts of the south east - forcing a total of .million people into Tier  in England. And a new iant of coronavirus was discovered which researchers believed may be spreading more quickly than usual. Labour, devolved governments and scientists called for a rethink. And in a historic plea, two medical journals told Boris Johnson: “The government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives. Questioned on December , Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman refused to rule out reducing the number of days bubble rules would last , or the number of households which could mix .Can I hug Gran in my bubble, or do we still have to socially distance  Legally, you can hug your Gran during the five days once you decide to form a Christmas bubble together. You do not need to maintain social distancing with people in your Christmas bubble. You can behave asyou’re in one household for that five-day period. However, this is only what the law says. Guidance strikes a very dferent tune. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty urged people not to hug elderly relativesyou want them to survive to be hugged again. Should I quarantine for two weeks before and after Christmas  The government has given mixed messages. You donapost have to - but yes, sort of,you can. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people should be extremely careful about who they meet in the run-up to Christmas as the virus can incubate for around  days. Government guidance said: You should reduce unnecessary contact with people you do not live with as much as possible in the two weeks before you form your Christmas bubble. Children should continue to go to school. It adds: In the two weeks that follow your last meeting with your Christmas bubble, you should reduce your contact with people you do not live with as much as possible. Children can continue to go to school.I’m already in a support bubble. How will this work People in England whose households are already joined together in a ‘support bubble’ count as one household for the purposes of Christmas.That means three support bubbles of six households could potentially join together for Christmas. However, two households that are joined together in a aposchildcare bubbleapos still count as two households for the purposes of Christmas. Itaposs only apossupport bubblesapos which have the exemption.Is there a limit to the number of people in a Christmas bubble No. The hard limit is three households.I’m in a house share. Can we all go into dferent bubbles Yes. As long as you stick with your inidual Christmas bubbles, you’re fine to all go back home to stay with your inidual parents. If you’re one of those people heading home, you’ll count as one of the three households in your Christmas bubble.Can I see friends, or is it just family  Either is fine. But beware that bubbles must be exclusive. In other words, you have to choose one or the other. If you see someone not in your Christmas bubble, it has to be in accordance with the rules for the Tier you are in. Can I go to the pub No. You cannot go with your bubble to hospitality settings - restaurants, bars or other indoor entertainment venues. Pubs and restaurants that are closed in Tier  areas will not reopen for Christmas.How and when should I travel to see my family You will be free to travel across tiers and national borders within the UK. However, you have to do all your travelling within the five-day period. The exception is for Northern Ireland, where the window will be wider - December - - to account for flights. This could cause chaos on public transport, where extra trains are not being laid on for Christmas. The government is urging people to book their travel and plan their journey in advance to avoid disappointment. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced a £m subsidy for coach journeys with firms like National Express.Can I travel the day before to avoid the rush  No, you’re not supposed to. The exception is for Northern Ireland, where the window will be wider - December - - to account for flights. This could cause some serious problems on public transport.  Whatmy relative is in a care home  Care home residents under  in England are allowed out to see family as part of a Christmas bubble - with extra measures such as a risk assessment and guidance on social distancing. Butthey are over  years old, they will be expected to stay in their care home.Can children of orced parents move between two Christmas bubbles  Yes. Children whose parents live apart will be able to move freely between two entirely separate Christmas bubbles. WhatI have Covid just before Christmas  You must not form a Christmas bubbleyou have coronavirus symptoms or are self-isolating at the time.The government says: These rules are the law and you must follow them evenit means not meeting with friends or family over Christmas. Whata family member tests positive while Iaposm bubbled up  You have to self-isolate and,youaposre still with family, stay there for the self-isolation period. The government says: If a member of your Christmas bubble tests positive for coronavirus or develops coronavirus symptoms between the  and  December, or up to  hours after members of the bubble last met, all members of the bubble must self-isolate asthey were members of the same household.Will I be punishedI break the Christmas rules It seems unlikely, as No want a consensus approach. But officials suggested police would be able to enforce any egregious breaches of the rules.What about New Year’s Eve The Christmas bubble system does not extend to New Year’s Eve.You’ll have to obey the lockdown rules that exist in your nation or Tier by then.Sorry.What aboutI was shielding People who shielded in Spring are not banned from a Christmas bubble, but are warned to be extra vigilant in the days before Christmas. The aposclinically extremely vulnerableapos, as they are known, are being told itaposs up to them whether to form a Christmas bubble as it does involve greater risks for you. You will minimise your risk of infectionyou limit social contact with people that you do not live with, government guidance adds. WhatI’m working over Christmas  Can I go home another time No, the five days are fixed as December -. Government sources admit the system is “not perfect” and won’t work for everyone. How are uni students counted Students in England were asked to go home in a week-long ‘travel window’ from December -.

If they did, it would mean your Christmas bubble had more than three households in total.Should I stay away from my family, evenit’s allowed That is, unfortunately, a judgement for you - depending on how close contact might be and how vulnerable your relatives are. The government made clear it won’t take responsibility, with its own winter plan saying: “This will not be risk-free. “Meeting up with other households will increase the risk of catching COVID-  and passing it on to others. “Even where it is within the rules, meeting with friends and family over Christmas will be a personal judgement for iniduals to take, mindful of the risks to themselves and others, particularly those who are vulnerable.” Boris Johnson added: “This virus is obviously not going to grant us a Christmas truce - it doesn’t know it’s Christmas. “And families will need to make a careful judgement about the risk of visiting elderly relatives.” Will it lead to more Covid cases and deaths  Yes, it is likely - and ministers have previously refused to rule out more deaths. The government’s Winter Plan says: “Christmas will likely lead to an increase in transmission. “And, historically, the period after Christmas is when the NHS sees the greatest pressure on services such as Accident  Emergency and the highest rates of bed occupancy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dominic cummings handed 40 pay","story":"NewsDominic Cummings handed % pay rise as Boris Johnsons army of highly paid aides doublesThe number of Downing Street aides paid more than £, almost doubled in the space of a year - while man of the people Cummings saw a bumper pay increasemirrorShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical Correspondent:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsMr Cummings got a pay rise of £, during his last year in the job \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Nicola Sturgeon said there was a case for tightening the rules ahead of a call with Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and other devolved leaders on Tuesday. And she warned that Scotland could follow its own pathnecessary. Current plans allowing people from up to three households to mix indoors between December  and December  have been under scrutiny due to rising cases and the discovery of a new iant, believed to be behind the rapid spread of coronavirus in London and southern England. Ms Sturgeon said nine cases of the new iant had been detected in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. The First Minister told MSPs: I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further, both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting. I will consider the views of the other nations,we can come to a four-nations agreement I think that would be preferable,that is not possible we will continue to consider within the Scottish Government what we think is appropriate. She urged Scots to take the utmost caution over Christmas and to avoid mixing with other households indoorspossible. If you feel it essential to do so - and we have tried to be pragmatic in recognising that some people will - then please reduce your unnecessary contacts as much as possible between now and then, she said.  Ms Sturgeon made the comments at the weekly review of Scottish restrictions, where she announced East Lothian, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils will move from Level  to Level  on Friday.

The Prime Minister is expected to urge the public to “stay local” over the festive season to avoid spreading the disease across the country. Ministers will hold more urgent talks tomorrow - Wednesday - with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as they thrash out a plan to curb infections. But Mr Johnson faced growing criticism over his decision to relax the rules over Christmas even though it risked a third wave of the deadly disease. Health experts warned the PM that sticking to his plan to allow households to mix was a “major error” that would overwhelm the NHS and cost many lives. The British Medical Association tonight called for an urgent review claiming the virus remained out of control. A poll by YouGov found that % of Brits want the relaxation of rules over Christmas to be dropped, while % think the rules should stay. It comes amid six suggested options to reduce virus spread over Christmas...Stick with the rules but tougher messagingCut the number of days the rules are relaxed for from five to threeReduce the number of households that are allowed to mix from three to twoPermit travel but restrict it to the same tier or regionMove the Christmas relaxation window to a time when cases are lower Instruct people to self-isolate before seeing loved onesDowning Street sources told the Mirror they would “certainly not” be changing the regulations to cancel gatherings or shorten the five-day festive break. But they hinted the PM could take “sensible” measures including encouraging people to stay away from grandparents - or self-isolate firstthey had to see them. Whitehall insiders suggested the Government would also persuade the public to “try to stay local” instead of travelling across the country at Christmas. But Mr Johnson faced accusations that he was so afraid to ‘cancel’ Christmas that he was prepared to put the health of the public at risk. Another  people died yesterday from the disease while cases rose in almost every part of the country.  Experts admitted that the new fast-spreading mutation of the virus had now spread to Wales and Scotland. Ministers were warned that pressing ahead with Christmas plans - which allow three households to mix between  and  and December - would cost many lives. For only the second time in  years, the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal joined forces to warn against “blundering into another major error” in its handling of the Covid pandemic that would overwhelm the NHS. They warned that a third wave in January would be worse than the second wave as there are already more than , Covid patients in hospital.  At the start of the second wave in the first week of September, there were just . In a joint editorial, they wrote: “The Government should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing and instead extend the tiers over the five-day Christmas period in order to bring numbers down in the advance of a likely third wave. “It should also review and strengthen the tier structure, which has failed to suppress rates of infection and hospitalisation.” BMA chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul added: “We are facing a Christmas with Covid infection rates still very high and evidence that the most recent lockdown managed only to stabilise infection rates, which have since risen signicantly.  “Whilst we understand that many families will naturally want to spend time together, we know that no one will want to put a family member or friend at risk from contracting the virus – that would be a terrible Christmas present and so we would urge everyone to do all they can to avoid this.” Writing in the Mirror, Dr Katherine Henderson, President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “We recognise the value to mental wellbeing of seeing friends and family and the desperation for people reunite but this will come at a cost. “The easing of restrictions will lead to a rise in transmission of the virus in the community and an increase in the number of covid cases. This could lead to further lockdowns in January. “So, we urge people to act responsibly this Christmas. This should not need a Government rule to happen.”  The Government’s Covid committee will review the tiering system tomorrow before announcing any changes tomorrow. They are expected to split some regions with urban areas with higher case numbers staying up, while more rural areas could move to lower tiers. Parts of West Yorkshire including Leeds are expected to go down into Tier , meaning hospitality can reopen and households mix outdoors. But local MPs fear that despite falling rates in Greater Manchester, which has faced the toughest restrictions since July, there is little will to move them.  Cabinet minister Michael Gove was holding a second round of urgent talks with the leaders of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland after health experts demanded a U-turn. Under rules agreed between the four UK governments, people in any tiers can travel and gather anywhere in the UK in their Christmas bubbles. Downing Street admitted the rules were kept under “constant review” but refused to give a cut-off date for when people could be told to change their plans. But since they were agreed, cases have risen exponentially in London and parts of the South East - forcing a total of .m people into Tier  in England. Before talks last night, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued the case for rowing back on planned freedoms to combat a rise in infections. And she said while a four-nation approach was “preferable” Scotland would take its own tougher routenecessary. But Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he will “not lightly put aside” the “hard-won” four nations agreement over household mixing at Christmas. Wales already has tougher guidance than England, however, as households are advised to self-isolatethey plan to get together with vulnerable relatives. Labour leader Keir Starmer demanded an urgent review by the COBRA emergency committee tomorrow - Wednesday. Crucially, he pledged Labour would support the Governmentit concluded that tougher restrictions are needed.

Raising all of London to Tier , along with much of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire, might make scientic sense with infection rates climbing rapidly. However the Christmas switch risks spreading the virus all over the country.

Hope at last GP surgeries in more than  locations around England are starting to give Covid- vaccinations, offering a glimmer of hope in otherwise grim times.  It is uplting that NHS nurses and pharmacists are working alongside surgery doctors and staff to inoculate the public in a massive effort to finally get on top of the virus.

The huge fairytale castle scene has been constructed by Dan and Mark Extance-Warr for the past four years and always attracts plenty of guests to take pictures of their home in Tintinhull, Somerset. Dan estimates they have splashed out about £, over the years to put it altogether, raising thousands of pounds for charity in the process.But the couple pulled the plug on the elaborate display this weekend after Avon and Somerset Police were called with concerns, as reported by Somerset Live.Dan and Mark says they had urged people to take care and be respectful of social distancing rules when gathering outside, with Dan even marshalling the crowds with a team to try and ensure the crowds remained safe.Police confirmed they advised turning off the lights after hundreds of people gathered, and the couple wrote on Facebook : We are sorry but we have had to turn the lights off, due to someone phoning the police about social distancing.We have asked this time and time again. We have also had a lot of people visiting from tier three areas. The police have said we have manned the lights perfectly, but unfortunately a small amount have ruined it for everyone .  We will be off for a few days and will try again when we feel safe to do it. Dan told Somerset Live the display had not been shut down by police, but officers had advised them to turn off the lights due to amount of flocking to their home. He added they had even received death threats posted through their door due to visitors blocking driveways, and suffered abuse from the public when they had attempted to enforce social distancing. He said: After the grief we have encountered over the last week, we couldn’t be anymore in agreement with them.  We personally have decided to turn them off for a while to hopefully help calm the aposvisitor attendanceapos. When andwe feel it’s safe to do so, we may turn them back on, but as it stands we have no intentions on turning them on, they certainly will not be on this week. He said their appeals for people to park responsibly, to social distance, and not to rush to the display as they had planned to keep it on until January  were all ignored. So this is the consequences, Dan added. Such a shame as we have had many pleasant families who have stuck to our requests and have helped us keep everyone  safe. Thereaposs always a certain few who think the rules don’t apply to them.  Any funds collected from the display this year will go to Macmillan, the NHS, the local air ambulance and several other causes, so far raising about £,. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed to Somerset Live: Yes we did have a call from a member of the public about this. There was a large number of people running into hundreds waiting to see them.

The mega-bucks multi-year golden handcuffs agreement is one of the largest signed in history for a newly formed podcast show. Today, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced the formation of their new audio production company, Archewell Audio, which has gone into partnership with Spoty.The news comes after the royal couple signed a Netflix deal over the summer rumoured to be worth more than £ million.Meghan also narrated the documentary Elephants on Disney+. Royal sources said Buckingham Palace was aware Harry and Meghan had set up their own production company to produce podcasts, but had “no knowledge” of the sums involved. One well placed insider said: The initial multi year deal is worth in excess of £ million with a view to extending the deal within six months. Meghan was the driving force behind the deal. She was incredible in the meetings with executives and had a clear vision of what they as a couple have to offer. There is a massive buzz about the content and the reach not only for Spoty but for Harry and Meghan, they have the midas touch right now.  “Spoty’s whole business plan is to acquire the world’s most talked about celebrities in one place and Harry and Meghan fit the bill entirely. Itaposs a win win scenario. Spoty announced an estimated £ million worth of exclusive deals this year with major names in the entertainment world. Michelle Obama debuted The Michelle Obama Podcast on Spoty in July after singing a deal rumoured to be worth tens of millions. Reality star turned campaigner Kim Kardashian West, married to music mogul Kanye West, also signed an exclusive deal with Spoty in June.The  announced a world record breaking exclusive deal worth £million with entertainer Joe Rogan in May. The Joe Rogan Experience podcast - which is one of the most popular in the world and had previously enjoyed incredible success on YouTube - aired on Spoty on  September. Industry sources said the deal to bring Meghan and Harry on board was “a perfect fit” with the business model to grow Spotyaposs global audience of  million monthly active users. The company said in a press release yesterday that the two will host and produce podcasts that build community through shared experience, narratives, and values. The duke and duchess said: What we love about podcasting is that it reminds all of us to take a moment and to really listen, to connect to one another without distraction. With the challenges of , there has never been a more important time to do so, because when we hear each other, and hear each otheraposs stories, we are reminded of how interconnected we all are.  Spoty has said Harry and Meghan will host a Holiday Special which is due to be released in the coming weeks. The announcement came  hours after The Mirror revealed palace insiders unhappy with Meghan enlisting the help of her billionaire neighbour Oprah Winfrey to help promote on social media a new vegan coffee brand she has invested in. Royal insiders last night remarked how the deal and the staggering sums involved is unusual for members of the royal family - and the pair are likely to face bear traps everywhere as they continue to pursue their own commercial activity. Royal author Penny Junor said Harry and Meghanaposs appeal stems, not from them as iniduals, but because they are royal. But she added they no longer benefit from gold standard advisers at Buckingham Palace, who would have checked their plans for pitfalls.Ms Junor said the coupleaposs other multi million-pound deal with Netflix had already proved controversial because the firm produced The Crown, with season four exploring the troubled le of Harryaposs late mother Diana, Princess of Wales. The royal expert said: I think unhappily, it is very dficult to square up being a member of the royal family with commercial activity because there are bear traps everywhere. Iaposm sure it never crossed Harry and Meghanaposs minds about The Crown, possibly being negative or damaging when they got their wonderful contract from Netflix.

They sit you on a table with other people. It was all very safe and organised and each group was separated by screens. Next to us was two couples out together, who were all lovely and we got chatting to them. They were all really friendly and lovely with the kids. The food was amazing as usual, we stuffed ourselves but still made space for dessert when we’d finished and the kids looked like Bruce Bogtrotter after the chocolate cake. Kimberley said that when she asked for the bill at the end of her meal, one of the men on the next table said their meal was on him. She said: As I was waiting, one of the men from the couples next to us told us our meal was on him.  He said it was a pleasure to sit by us and that he’d just like to treat us. I honestly couldn’t believe it. Our bill must have come to the best part of £. The waiter came over and said our bill had been paid and that in all of his time working there he’s never had that happen. After such a rubbish year, that honestly nearly made me cry, and the kids were genuinely speechless, which is a miracle in itself.After the amazing gesture, Kimberley shared the story on Facebook to again thank the man and his family for treating them.She said: He didn’t do it for any recognition, it was a purely altruistic and because he had enjoyed our company, which was the best thing about it. Despite thanking them several times, I felt the need to share it on social media in the hopes it would find the people and let them know how grateful we were.

But there were fears she may not have enough bone left for the operation to be successful.  Friends and family have now paid tribute to the kind and beautul lady. In September last year Jayne spoke out on World Sepsis Day, hoping to raise awareness of the condition. She said her le was turned upside down and she had told Rob that he could leave herhe wished to. Jayne said the last three years of recovery have brought huge challenges to her and coming to terms with the limits she faces has been dficult.

The rules ied depending on where they lived. Under the new restrictions published on Monday in a document called aposSupporting pregnant women using maternity services during the coronavirus pandemic: Actions for NHS providersapos health trusts are requested to review their current rules. Health chiefs are asked to undertake a risk assessment in each part of their maternity service to see where there could be an increased risk of transmitting coronavirusa birthing partner is present and tackle any issues with appropriate infection prevention and control measures including training and PPE. Pregnant mums and their support partner should also be tested for the virus before they attend  and  week scans and any maternity-related appointments. Birthright, an organisation that promotes human rights in pregnancy and childbirth, welcomed the changes.They tweeted: Delighted to see the revised guidance for visiting in maternity services, recognising that #partnersarenotvisitors, that they are a key component of safe and personalised maternity care who should be included throughout.In September mum-to-be Gemma Wilson who expecting a baby with her partner, Nikki, , after going through IVF, said the rules which forced her to go to appointments alone were not acceptable.She backed the #butnotmaternity campaign which had launched a petition to call for restrictions on maternity services to be lted.

But more changes could be imminent, with the tiers officially reviewed on Wednesday and any moves coming into effect from December , before another review on the rd. Latest infection rates, for the week up to December , suggests infections are on the rise in Warrington and Cheshire, Suffolk, Buckinghamshire, Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset. These are all Tier  areas at risk of moving up to Tier . Meanwhile, Greater Manchester could be moved down to Tier  as case rates continue to drop - now below London. Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham are other cities, previously hit with very high Covid- rates, that are still recording week-on-week drops, although itaposs not clear how low infection rates must fall for the Government to consider moving places down a tier. Meanwhile areas of Herefordshire, Dorset and Devon could be hopeful of moving down to Tier , which will enable pubs to fully reopen and indoor socialising, after a fall in cases. Infection rates are not the only barometer used to determine an areaaposs tier - hospital capacity and prevalence among over-s specically are also big factors.The Health Secretary said there had been very sharp, exponential rises in the southeast - and they  may be due to a newly-discovered iant of coronavirus which is growing faster. He said over , cases of the new strain in nearly  council areas have already been found - and in some areas, the virus is doubling every seven days.However, people in all tiers  will still be allowed to meet up to two other households to form a Christmas bubble  between December -.Despite pressure to scrap the Christmas truce, MPs have been told it will stay - but there will be heavier messaging around the risk it poses to elderly relatives.  The parts of Essex going into Tier  are Basildon, Braintree, Brentwood, Castle Point, Chelmsford, Epping Forest, Harlow, Maldon, Rochford, Southend-on-sea and Thurrock. The parts of Hertfordshire going into Tier  are Watford, Hertsmere, Broxbourne and Three Rivers. If no areas in the north and Midlands get knocked back down to Tier  this week, there will be .million people in Tier  in total - well over half of England.  However, not all Tier  areas are experiencing rises, despite being hampered by severe restrictions regardless. Trafford, Gateshead, Derbyshire Dales and Stratford-on-Avon, currently in Tier , have case levels similar to areas with the lowest rates and where cases are decreasing. Council leaders and MPs in some of these areas have called for counties to be split.But in Essex and London, council leaders and mayor of London Sadiq Khan have called for assurances their areas will remain united. This is despite large parts of the capital, mostly in the central and western areas, have infection rates well below the national average. However, this is cancelled out by the soaring case rates in several boroughs, including Bromley and Haringey - with the latter seeing close to a  percent increase in the last week of lockdown. Of the  local areas in England,  have seen a rise in case rates,  have seen a fall, and two areas are unchanged in the latest rolling seven-day rate of new cases.  Swale in Kent continues to have the highest rate in England, with , new cases recorded in the seven days to December  - the equivalent of . cases per , people. This is up from . in the seven days to December . Basildon in Essex is in second place, where the rate has risen sharply from . to ., with , new cases. Medway, also in Kent, has the third highest rate, up from . to ., with , new cases. Aside from Basildon, the areas with the biggest week-on-week jumps are AshfordHastingsand Canterbury .

Cleo often draws the comparison to the long-necked animal on social media thanks to her very long legs.  The -month-old pooch was adopted by her owner Claire Puissant, , from a breeder in Ohio.Now the dog has her own Instagram account with an impressive , followers, where fans rave about the unusual looking pooch.“Cleoaposs long legs are an attribute of her breed, sheaposs a sighthound and has ancestry from hunting dogs who are notably aerodynamic and lean,” proud owner Clare said. “She is a highly intelligent, expressive, goofy dog and is very outgoing and adventurous and displays many traits that are common in sighthounds. “Cleo can be extremely affectionate but also very independent in her own right. She enjoys long rocky hikes, playing with her big sister and quiet days-in taking naps.” The social media star lives alongside four-year-old white and brindle Borzoi named Abeline in Wisconsin, United States.  Clare, who works as a laboratory scientist, adopted Cleo in  and says people love her distinctive look. On her Instagram, the pooch can be found posing adorably in a range of colourful outfits. But her extremely long-legged figure makes it challenging to dress the canine, admits Clare.   She said: “Finding Cleo clothing is actually a lot more dficult than it seems, commercially sold products are never long enough for Cleo and often look like crop tops on her.  “Iaposve been lucky to find a few Sighthound brands that I really love, and to have really talented friends who have made Cleo outfits as well.” While her long legs are part of her distinctive look now, it took time for Cleo to grow into them, adds owner Clare. As a puppy, she definitely had her awkward phases of learning to run with such long goofy legs, But she quickly grew into them and became very graceful.” Speaking about the online reaction to Cleo, the proud owner said: “I am honestly so stunned by the reactions sheaposs received online.  I started her account really just for me, and am continuously humbled by both the Instagram and TikTok communitiesapos support. “Silken Wind hounds are a newer breed and I hope that through my account people can learn more about where they come from and just overall what amazing dogs they are.” Fans have left raving comments about the unique-looking pooch on social media.

While Father Chrismas prepares to reward nice children with gts, those who have misbehaved have been known to receive a lump of coal. But across parts of Europe, a terrying tradition called Krampusnacht sees people dress up in horrying costumes to frighten children. The story goes that good children are visited by Santa, and naughty children are visited by the Christmas Devil who literally beats people into being nice. The tradition takes place in countries such as Austria, Germany, Hungary, Slovenia, and the Czech Republic, where legend says Krampus would swat wicked children, stuff them in a sack, and take them away. On December  the Krampus run takes place, where children are taunted by performers. Footage from the Czech Republic shows the Christmas devil visiting a family in their house. Young children in the video are left hysterical as they cower and run to their parents in a bid to get away from the terrying creature - itaposs not what comes to mind when you think of Christmas. National Geographic says the German tradition has been around for centuries.The legendary beast Krampus, who is said to be the son of Hel in Nose mythology, appears on December , now known as Krampus Night, whipping his chains and lashing his bells according to folklore.

Miriam Rodriguez relentlessly tracked down those responsible for the kidnap and murder of her -year-old daughter Karen in a story reminiscent of the hit Hollywood film Taken. After taking matters into her own hands, the brave mum was instrumental in taking down  criminals from the notorious Mexican drugs cartel Los Zetas, one of the most dangerous in the country. In the three years following Karenaposs death, Miriam captured nearly every living member of the crew that had abducted her daughter for ransom in an area where even the official authorities are too scared to bring justice against cartel iniduals. Her vigilante quest eventually cost Miriam her le as she was murdered in San Fernando, Mexico, after gunmen broke into her home. Following her death, Tamaulipas governor Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca said on Twitter that the state government “will not allow the death of Miriam Rodríguez to be one statistic more”,reported. To aid her crusade to bring her daughteraposs killers to justice, she cut her hair, dyed it and disguised herself before playing ious roles including a health worker and election official to get their names and addresses. Miriam invented excuses to meet their families to tease details from them and build her investigation.  She captured one of those involved in the crime who was selling flowers on the street. The florist was flogging roses to make ends meet and Miriam managed to track him down. He recognised her and ran but Miriam,  at the time, was able to tackle him to the floor and held a gun to his throat, threatening to kill himhe moved. Miriam has become a hero in her hometown for taking on the cartel and she has a bronze plaque honouring her in the central square.

I’d say we were mismanaged .“Our general manager of  years – the third-highest in command of our club # had to stand outside the stadium from half-past  to quarter to two before he could get in.“He’s there to check our dressing-room is fit for purpose and everything is alright because we are in a pandemic.We had staff members who weren’t treated in the way I believe they should have been.“We also weren’t allowed to film the game which isn’t right.“We’re in a situation in Scottish football where I believe we should be helping each other out.“This is my opinion, it’s not the opinion of the club.“There’s no rule to say you can’t film games, we do it for our own purpose so we can show the players on Monday morning what worked and what didn’t, like every team in the wold does.“What annoyed me about that is we asked Heartswe could film, absolutely no problem at all. Alloa was no problem, even though the game was on TV.“Clubs are helping other clubs out but I didn’t feel we got that on Saturday.“That’s disappointing and not the way as a club we’d do things. When it affects my staff I’ll come out fighting for them.”Saturday was the first meeting between the two clubs since the infamous vote that ended the   season and the recriminations that followed.A May statement from Inverness CEO Scot Gardiner # former chief executive at Dundee # and chairman Ross Morrison took aim at the SPFL and Dens managing director John Nelms over his voting U-turn.Nelms, meanwhile, had spoken of “bad blood” throughout the league after Gardiner read out a private WhatsApp conversation between clubs on live radio.Gardiner, speaking to the Press  Journal, expressed his surprise over McPake’s criticism.He said: “I spoke to Jimpersonally before the match and after the match and he said everything was great.“There were no problems at all.“Jim was in with us at half-time in the boardroom and had a cup of tea and sandwich. He never mentioned anything and everything was fine.“It seems a bizarre comment for James McPake to make in the circumstances.”Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

That’s frustrating.“But we showed a real good character and work-rate. I enjoyed it, it was a really feisty game which you don’t see much of these days.“It was really high energy, there was a lot of hard work and it’s disappointing with a decision like that, it was a clear offside.“It’s hard when you do what’s right as a defence – when the crosser cut in, we stepped up and the boy who is offside flicks it to Keats who finishes really well.“We’ve shown in the last few games a real bit of grit and determination that we need.“It was tough to take on Saturday because you defend right and get punished by a sloppy officials decision.“They are there to make decisions but they didn’t do their job –they had the result might have been dferent.“However, you can’t change it so we have to take that determination on to next week now.”Performances have improved but wins continue to elude Dundee on the road as they fell further behind leaders Hearts.The Jambos smashed Queen of the South - to go nine points ahead of the Dark Blues, who remain in seventh spot in the Championship table ahead of next weekend’s big clash with Dunfermline.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\": today for unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite. nThis offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-first-epaper--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

If you look at him again, there#s no elbow there. The referee saw it and dealt with it.“It was a foul and a yellow card and it#s been dealt with.“Butyou look at it again, next time I see you you#ll say it wasn#t an elbow.”The Tangerines levelled the game through Liam Smith’s first goal for the club after James Tavernier’s brilliant freekick opener for the visitors. Connor Goldson headed home what turned out to be the winner just before the break.Mellon called the display a “step in the right direction” for his team despite taking no points.He said: “The movement from Liam for the goal was great and something we’ve worked on.“We knew we would have to be good at it against a Rangers team we knew would have possession.“We knew we would have to be good in the turnovers and creating chances and when they came along like they did show the quality we did to try and get a goal.“The very minimum I wanted to take was that I would be disappointed we didn’t get something and to be thinking that, although hard to accept because we’re all winners, it goes towards us doing what we want to do which is moving the club forward.“We’re only  games into a new level for us which I have to keep reminding everyone because this group hasn’t played at this level for many years so we’re trying to grow something.“Games like today’s allow us to look at where we’re at as a football club. We got an awful lot of things right and things we will continue to try and get better at as we move on through the season.“As gutted as we are, it’s a step in the right direction for the football club in terms of making it competitive against Rangers.”As for the runaway Premiership leaders, Tavernier was understandably delighted to score such a spectacular freekick.The Ibrox skipper said: “I really enjoyed it, especially with the distance it was from.“I was practising the other day and I am really happy it came through today.“I’ve always said I am happy to contribute to the game and help the boys.

just a week after restrictions were eased.Ms Sturgeon said: #We have been monitoring the situation in both Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire very closely and have concluded that tougher restrictions do now need to be applied.#It is our judgement that Level  restrictions are necessary to bring the situation in both Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire back under control.“I know that the move to Level  for East Lothian, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire – and the continuation of it in many other areas – involves real and continued dficulties for many businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector.“However these measures are in our view essential to get and keep the virus under control.“It is also worth pointing out that we are not alone in Scotland in facing these challenges just now.“In large parts of England, hospitality is closed completely. And the whole of Wales is now under restrictions similar to our Level three.#However, I know this brings no comfort to those directly affect, the government will do all we can to provide support.#Level  means that hospitality businesses in the regions will have to close at pm and cannot serve alcohol at all.Travel out of the area, unless for work or other essential purposes, is also not permitted.Ms Sturgeon announced there will be a further review next week due to the #rising cases# across the country. Previously, today had been the last planned one of the year.Moray and the Highlands and islands remain in level one.Ms Sturgeon urged “the utmost caution” in meeting over Christmas as discussions are due later today on the easing of restrictions.Following a joint call from the British Medical Journal and Health Service Journal, the leaders of the devolved administrations and the UK Government will discuss the changes.Under the current plans, eight people from three households will be able to mix indoors between December  and December .Ms Sturgeon said: “There will be a four-nations discussion later today to take stock of recent developments.“But, for now, I would urge the utmost caution.“If you can avoid mixing with other households over Christmas, especially indoors, please do.“Butyou feel it essential to do so – and we have tried to be pragmatic in recognising that some people will – then please reduce your unnecessary contacts as much as possible between now and then.”Ms Sturgeon also mentioned the new iant of Covid that was mentioned by UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock yesterday.She added:  #I#ve been advised that nine cases of this new iant are in Scotland, all these cases are in Greater Glasgow and Clyde.#No evidence at the moment to say this will cause the virus to sp rapidly.#Scottish Conservative MSP for Aberdeenshire West, Alexander Burnett, was #disappointed# to see the region being moved up a level.He said: #It’s extremely disappointing Aberdeenshire has been moved into Level  so close to Christmas.“Our hospitality sector has been decimated by repeated closures and this is likely to hurt even more during what is supposed to be one of their busiest periods.“Businesses in the region have done everything they can to ensure safety and compliance with the regulations.“Local control measures have been put in place in Aberdeenshire which have meant figures have started to steady in the last few days.“Financial support must now be put in place by the SNP Government for our vital hospitality sector which has been dealt yet another blow.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

There was the day we came back and Humphrey had managed to get himself out of his cage. He had ransacked the larder to find fairy cake, and I do mean ransacked. Everything was everywhere. He was sitting on one of the easy chairs with a lump of cake in one hand and a chocolate biscuit in the other.”The origins of the zoo started long before its official opening in July . It was the brainchild of Dr Lil de Kock, of the University of Aberdeen’s zoology department, who was joined by like-minded iniduals in driving the idea forward at the start of the s.That included Rob’s father, George, then a porter at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, but who also had a keen love of the natural world and became a key player in the Aberdeen and North of Scotland Zoological Society.As the physical zoo was being built at Hazlehead Park, where Pet’s Corner is today, animals for the collection were being gathered and donated and housed at ious places and homes across the city, with George organising the farming out of the beasts, from donkeys to monkeys.Which is how there came to be marmosets in Mastrick.Rob said: “We had an aviary stuck at the back of our council house at Sheddocksley Road, so we had ious birds, cats and the marmosets… a whole pile of things.“Marmosets make a very high-pitched noise and the marmoset we had, a male named Sinni, kept looking out the window at more or less the same time every morning, making this noise. We discovered by chance a family nearby had another marmoset, a female named Chico. She had been bartered for a packet of cigarettes in Rio de Janeiro and brought back to the UK. There wasn’t a lot of regulation back then.“At the same time Sinni was whistling and looking to the south, the female was looking towards our house and whistling.”When the neighbours heard of the plans for the zoo, they donated their marmoset.  Chico and Sinni went on to breed successfully, producing twins every year from  to .Once the Leslies moved into the manager’s house at the zoo, Rob found himself deeply involved in the world of the zoo and its animals.“I was there while the zoo was being built, then I was working there during the school holidays, helping out,” said Rob. “But it is all-consuming. You can imagine that because one of the walls of the house forms the perimeter of the zoo, it is a  ,  days a year calling,you like.“I remember my father and mother were away at one time and some cables came down in a bit of a storm. I had to climb trees and throw cables from one building to another to get heaters going to make sure the animals didn’t perish. But it was interesting, I have to say,” said Rob, who actually went on to follow a successful career in construction, including lecturing at Robert Gordon University.The zoo was clearly something Rob loved and has many fond memories of, including those of his favourite creature, Sparky the gibbon.“He used to see me coming and swing around and get his back scratched,” said Rob. “But your ambition at the end of the day was still to be able to count to  on all your fingers. Virtually everything bites and it’s a case of just being aware of that.”Rob said that message was constantly drilled into the many volunteers who came along to work at the zoo. One young volunteer had a sharp lesson on the need to take care around the beasts they were tending.  For reasons best known to himself, the lad had gone into the mountain lion enclosure and ended up confronted by a puma.“There was a tree in the enclosure… and this young lad was trying to climb that tree with the aid of his shoulder blades because he was just pinned to it, with this thing spitting in front of him,” said Rob.“That was very serious but he was rescued and no one was hurt. But I’m sure it’s an event he will never forget.”Of course, not all the close encounters with the animals were in an enclosure. Some of them were very adept at making a great escape. Especially the porcupines.“Mostly it was rabbits and sheep and things like that which found their way into Hazlehead Park, but the main ones were the two porcupines. They got out at regular intervals. They just shimmied up the tree that was there and waddled along the branch and dropped down the other side,” said Rob, adding they could get quite far.“By chance, Lil de Kock was travelling on a backroad between the zoo and Cults one evening and saw a porcupine that got out of the zoo and this was quite a bit away. She managed to recapture it. But one did eventually disappear, never to be seen again.”One of Rob’s most memorable stories revolves around Gavin Maxwell of Ring Of Bright Water fame who was at the zoo to discuss with his father, George, housing one of the otters featured in the acclaimed book.“They had consumed quite a bit of alcohol at the weekend and things got ‘interesting’, shall we say,” said Rob, describing Maxwell’s demands on the zoo as “exacting”.By interesting, Rob means his father and Maxwell decided after drinking into the early hours the only way to settle their dferences was to have a duel. Maxwell was going to get a revolver from his car, while George was going to get his shotgun.Rob’s mother woke him up and after some ”cajoling” the pair agreed to sleep it off instead. The deal fizzled out thereafter.When the zoo first opened, there were ambitious plans to expand it, taking in almost  acres of Hazlehead Park and bringing in more and more animals. There was even a campaign to bring an elephant to the zoo, with members of the public donating to the fund in a period of “jumbo” frenzy in the Granite City.But the idea was scrapped, along with any hopes of expansion, as council support for the zoo dwindled, along with funds from the city coffers.Eventually, facing financial dficulties, the zoo closed in , despite a huge public outcry and pleas to save it.Now Rob has written Marmosets In Mastrick to pay tribute to the place, its animals and exceptional staff, such as head keeper John Buchan, who made the zoo such a memorable institution.“I think a lot of younger people are surprised that there was a zoo and that it had lions and chimpanzees,” he said, adding the older generation still have fond memories of it.“I went up to the Pet’s Corner and was talking to the guy who has been there  years. He still has people coming in and saying: ‘I gave money to the elephant fund all those years ago, but you don’t have an elephant, so can I have my money back #Rob has included chapters about the zoo’s animals written by his father before his death, as well as drawing on a treasure trove of George’s extensive record of minutes from meetings of the zoo society as well as press cuttings.In his book, Rob is unflinching about his father’s problem drinking, wanting to be open about it rather than have it viewed as a “serious omission” by people who knew George.But despite his drinking, George was always devoted to the animals in his care and to making the zoo a success – something which Rob emphatically says it was.“The number of people who came to the zoo was phenomenal,” said Rob. “But also the breeding success the zoo had. Despite my father having effectively fallen out with Gavin Maxwell, a few years later he was awarded the Gavin Maxwell Award because Malayan otters bred at Aberdeen Zoo for the first time outside Malaysia.”Rob also praised the zoo’s exemplary and ground-breaking education work. Every month when they had children coming along to a zoo club, there was an average attendance of  to  children.Marmosets in Mastrick was published last month and Rob hopes it will raise more awareness of Aberdeen Zoo, its compelling stories and the success it enjoyed.“In the north-east, we hide our light under a bushel. Sometimes, I don’t think we tell people that we were successful. The zoo, by numbers, by breeding, by education, it was a success.“There was a lot going for it and I just wanted to record that there was such a thing. It’s a bit of Aberdeen’s history.”For more information on Marmosets In Mastrick, visit the Aberdeen Zoo Facebook page.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-express-epaper--month\":This offer will auto renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-express-web-pack--month\": today and get unlimited access to the Evening Express website. nThis offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-express-web-epaper\",\"evening-express-epaper--month\",\"evening-express-web-pack--month\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Martin Bonar replaced Scott Johnston for Saints while Chris Hart made way for Innes Meikle for the hosts.The deadlock was broken in the th minute from a quickly-taken free kick by Cammy Hill after Martin Bonar had been brought down in the centre circle by James McGuiness.Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space on the right and sent him scurrying forward. McKay cut into the box and picked out the run of Craig MacEwan who was foiled from six yards by Ally Lewis.The young keeper#s good work was undone when he couldn#t hold MacEwan#s shot allowing the ball to spin away from him.Ben Forbes was on hand with a sliding challenge to knock the loose ball away from MacEwan but only as far as Gavin Forgrieve, who gleefully tapped home from four yards.Lewis saved again from MacEwan three minutes later this time managing to hold onto the ball at the second attempt before a neat Matty Kelly turn on the corner of the Star -yard box wrong footed Ben Forbes creating the space for Kelly to curl a ball to the far post a matter of inches in front of the outstretched boot of Scott Maitland.Maitland got forward again in the st minute finding Gavin Forgrieve in front of goal. He took the ball down well only for Innes Meikle to get back with a vital challenge at the expense of a corner kick.Martin Bonar climbed well at the back post to meet Forgrieve#s delivery from the right but couldn#t direct his header on target.Despite being unable to hit the target himself Bonar was able to claim an st minute assist for the second and final goal.The big midfielder, a key member of Red Star#s  Scottish Amateur Football League Premier Division Two title winning side, won possession well in the centre circle and opened up his former team mates with a perfectly weighted pass for the forward run of skipper Craig MacEwan.Top marksman MacEwan comfortably beat stranded Red Star keeper Ally Lewis with a deft chip from  yards into the unguarded net.Referee Jimmy Litster, who ensured the two local rivals remained on friendly terms throughout, called time on proceedings after three added minutes with both sides satisfied to complete another  minutes while the majority of their respective league rivals remain side-lined."},{"url":null,"title":"in praise of john campbell factor mor","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The town on its present site would be taking shape by the time young Zachary began his schooling.His education, however, was said to be #rudimentary#, so young Zachary began teaching himself Latin and Greek as he absorbed English classic literature.Employed from the age of  in a merchant#s office in Glasgow, historical references describe him falling into #bad company# and indulging in excessive drinking.At the age of  in  he emigrated to Jamaica to take up a role as a book-keeper, effectively a slave overseer, on a sugar plantation. Such was his horror and disgust at the way in which slaves were treated on the plantation that he became an implacable opponent of the slave trade.He gave up his job in Jamaica # by this time a #model book-keeper# # and ed in  to Britain and secured a position in London. His sister Jean had married Thomas Babington of Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, a country gentleman and ardent evangelical. Babington took MacAulay under his wing and introduced him to the Clapham Sect # a group of Tories against slavery.Among them was William Wilberforce, founder and leader of the anti-slavery movement.Through working with the Clapham Sect, MacAulay was invited in  to visit Sierra Leone # the West African colony established to provide a home to emancipated slaves from the United States who came to Sierra Leone via Nova Scotia.In , aged , he was promoted to the post of governor and remained in the post until .Returning to England on a slave ship, he brought with him  African children, with the hope of finding them a better le in the Clapham Sect community.He settled in Surrey following his marriage to Selina Mills on August , .Having witnessed the misery of slavery, MacAulay became a member of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, working closely with Wilberforce, and soon became a leading figure in the parliamentary campaign. He later became secretary of the committee, which became known as the African Institution.The campaign succeeded in , with an Act of Parliament making the slave trade illegal throughout the British Empire. The practice, however, was to continue despite this victory.Many abolitionists had thought slavery would fade away once the slave trade was stopped, but that failed to happen.MacAulay continued in his activism, helping seize a slave ship in . On this act, William Wilberforce commented in a letter to MacAulay, #you really deserve a statue#.In the s MacAulay turned his attention towards securing the total abolition of slavery itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slaveryin , and was editor of its monthly publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter from its launch in .His major contribution was the collection and collating of a huge volume of evidence showing the true scale of slavery # a role to which he was ideally suited as a skilled statistician with a meticulous approach and an exceptional head for figures.It was also during this period that MacAulay co-founded University College London.Publication of the Reporter continued until , but by the end the work had worn MacAulay out and he had got into debt.In  Selina died and, with his finances in disarray, MacAulay was exiled to Paris in  # the year the Slavery Abolition Act came into force which ended slavery throughout the British Empire.He ed to England once his debts were liquidated and died on May , . He was buried in a London cemetery, but after the site became a public park # St George#s Gardens # the exact location of his grave was lost.MacAulay is commemorated with a le-sized memorial bust in Westminster Abbey.To mark the th anniversary of his birth in , a memorial plaque was unveiled in the gardens, donated by the Royal Statistical Society, the Friends of St George#s Gardens, University College London and the Clan MacAulay Association.William Wilberforce said of Zachary MacAulay: #My sober and deliberate opinion is that you [Zachary MacAulay] have done more towards this consummation [abolishing slavery] than any other man.#For myself, I take pleasure in acknowledging that you have been my tutor all the way and that I could have done nothing without you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a family passion for scotlands beauty","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Frances and Ross depict the ever-changing and often harsh weather conditions which frame their Argyll home.A Family Affair explores their shared artistic tropes as they both represent the landscape of Scotland’s islands and west coast, working in nature, directly inBoth use oil paint and other media, drawing with the brush or palette kne to make urgent, swt marks that capture the fleeting effects and drama of changing weather.They also share Crinan, where the Ryan family has run the Crinan Hotel since the mid-seventies, from where Ryan left for school, then art school and set out on extensive travels. But the beauty of Argyll # and his boat Sgarbh # drew him back.Earlier this year Ross held his second solo exhibition with The Scottish Gallery, but due to lockdown not a single person was able to attend.Frances has been a regular exhibitor with the gallery for years with her distinctive Hebridean seascapes and landscapes showing the repeated mots of Iona, The Mull of Kintyre, the bays around Crinan and the view across to Jura and the Corryvreckan.Like a good modernist Frances is reluctant to give any commentary on her works but Ross, on the other hand, makes extensive notes on his journeys allowing others to understand how hard-won the paintings are, particularly in winter when the harsh conditions create privations and huge physical problems. Each painting becomes a manestation and record of time and place.His affinity with the natural world is reflected in his long-term project of setting messages in bottles on the ocean, which brings him encounters as he journeys to meet the people who find them, and make new works at the location of the find.A Family Affair will be presented concurrently with Mark Hearld’s Menagerie, which will transport visitors to an animal-filled world with a series of prints, woodcut and linocuts inspired by the artist’s love of British flora and fauna.A Family Affair and Mark Hearld’s Menagerie will be at The Scottish Gallery in Edinburgh between Saturday November  and Wednesday December ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Hill spotted Aaron McKay in space, who cut into the box and picked out MacEwan, who was foiled from six yards by Lewis. The keeper couldn#t hold the shot, and the ball eventually fell to Gavin Forgrieve, who tapped home from four yards.Nine minutes from time Saints midfielder Bonar, a key member of Red Star#s  Premier Division Two title-winning side, passed to MacEwan, who beat the keeper with a deft chip from  yards.Match report and photographs: Derek Black"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor november 20 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

All representatives who are isolating or unable to attend must be able to speak up for their voters.We noted as early as June that the abrupt shut-down of remote participation was bound to leave communities unrepresented as the pandemic continued to rage. The Commons took a step backwards in ending this too early.MPs and voters need consistency and transparent standards for how these crucial democratic decisions are made.We can#t have ato the conga line chaos we saw in June, or the decisions simply being made on a whim by a minister.MPs need clarity about how they can continue to represent their voters during this stark second wave and beyond.There must be far greater transparency over how these decisions on participation are made, rather than ministers being forced to act at the last moment.Since some MPs may be isolating or not safe to travel in person, there’s a real threat for democratic representation and political equalityremote participation continues to be strictly limited or indeed denied. Virtual proceedings in the summer were a real success in bringing parliament into the st century. Let’s learn from that and ensure all voters are heard.Darren Hughes, chief executive, the Electoral Reform Society.Sir,SNP ministers must outline how they are planning for a Covid- vaccine rollout across Scotland.People are understandably feeling positive about a potential vaccine for coronavirus, which is why it is critical for the SNP government to lay out the detail of its roll-out plans as a matter of urgency.We can ill-afford to repeat the same mistakes we saw with the flu vaccination earlier this year.Ministers need to set out what infrastructure is being put in place right now so they are ahead of the game when it comes to rolling out any vaccine across Scotland when it becomes available, and doing so fairly and effectively.Getting this right will be particularly important for the Highlands and Islands with our dispersed population and challenging geography.We must be assured that our region does not end up playing catch-up with the central belt which is an understandable concern locally, given the track record of this government in other matters affecting us.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP and Shadow Health Secretary.Sir,In the recent storms  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte, using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish lost half their sky channels including BBC  and STV.As I write, it#s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ # a lot cheaper than fitting a dish.I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm proof in the loft, though was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast the TV guide just lists the the Freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there were more channels available on main transmitters than there was on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas with TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay#s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including our MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Isle of Islay.Sir,I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

The current bus stop and car park at the head of Glen Croe would also be bypassed. This is an important public transport link for local residents.The consultation launched by the Scottish Government’s Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson is a muddled exercise. It confuses the urgent need to decide on an alternative route for a new road through Glen Croe with the much longer-term strategic transport options for improving connectivity between Argyll and west-central Scotland.Most of the strategic options involve a number of new civil engineering challenges including the construction of bridges over Loch Long and Loch Fyne and extensive road building, both new and upgraded. For reasons of cost and complexity, none of these options are likely to be implemented within this decade.Whatever long-term strategy options may be investigated for their feasibility, there remains the urgent need to build a new road in Glen Croe. It will always be necessary to link the communities of Arrochar Tarbetwith Loch Goil, Cairndow, north Loch Fyne, Inveraray and beyond with the A.I note that both my local community council in Loch Goil and Argyll and Bute Council support the route that follows the existing forest track on the opposite side of the glen from the Rest and Be Thankful without a similar risk of landslides. Compared with the strategic options, this is a modestof road to construct.The sooner that steps are taken to realise this solution the better it will be for all who currently suffer the increasingly frequent road closures due to climate change and the unstable hill.Alastair R Moodie, LochgoilheadSir,Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling session with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC ScotlandSir,Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures november 27 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Evenyou are a non-believer or one who doubts in the existence of God, you can always say #Godyou are there please, please come and help me#.Give it a go and not only will it give you relief from boredom and loneliness when you pray but numerous other benefits will accrue – and, of course, dipping into a Bible will enrich your prayer enormously.Calum MacFarlane-Barrow, Dalmally."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week december 4 2020","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Why  Because this modication very effectively protects moths from becoming bat-fodder.Butterflies are active during the day but moths are mostly nocturnal. And under the night sky moths make a tasty meal for insectivorous bats. These tiny mammals detect their prey by echo-location, a method of hunting that involves emitting repeated ultrasonic squeaks, generally with a dominant frequency range of - kilohertz . Their prey is then located from the direction of the ing echoes.Moths have evolved ious mechanisms to evade these predators: some have developed ears that detect bat echolocation calls, allowing them to take evasive action, but others, the earless moths, have to rely on passive defences – so-called acoustic camouflage # that is, their hairy thoraces.Comparing tomographic echo images from two species of earless moths with two species of diurnal butterflies, the Bristol scientists found very little effect on the ultrasound echoes from the thin layer of thoracic scales of butterflies. In contrast, the hair-like scales covering moth thoraces absorbed around  per cent of the ultrasonic sound energy in the broadband - kHz. This provides clear protection from hunting bats and consequently is a very signicant survival advantage.Addressing the mechanisms behind the ultrasound reduction achieved by moth thoraces, the scientists found that the hair-like scales form a connected network of air pockets, which act as porous ultrasound absorbers. Sound waves entering the network cause air molecules in the pockets to vibrate, thereby dissipating energy and reducing echo reflection.The overall arrangement and microstructure of hair-like moth scales closely resembles man-made fibrous materials designed to absorb sound but, interestingly, the Bristol team showed that the moth scales have a considerably higher absorption capacity. So perhaps we could learn lessons from these small hairy creatures.* J. R. Soc.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time. We’re busy with the bargains and not so bothered about the baby.We’re busy with the tinsel but haven’t time for the truth. We’re busy with the mince pies and we will get round to the manger.We’re busy trying to fix the tree lights but have forgotten about theWe’re busy with the cards but have pushed away the crib. We’re busy – it is Christmas after all.We just don’t have time right now. We will make time for God when we’re less busy.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,I am delighted that the Scottish Government is taking forward my campaign for greater fire safety precautions in social housing.Guidance is now going out to the building industry, ahead of installing fire sprinklers in all new social housing with new regulations coming into effect next year.The sprinklers will be a requirement in new flats, maisonettes and larger multi-occupancy dwellings, including where care is provided.Fire sprinklers have  proved time and time again to be effective in the fight against fire and I know that this move will save lives.There has always been strong backing for these plans from the public, the industry and other MSPs, especially in the light of the Grenfell Tower disaster.I would still like retro-fitting sprinklers in older properties to be considered and, although that is my longer term hope, I understand the problems this would pose.I am delighted this is coming in before I retire as an MSP at next year#s election – what better than a le-saving #present# at Christmas David Stewart MSP, Highlands and Islands RegionSir,Can I please, through the columns of the Argyllshire Advertiser, say a very big thank you to all the wonderful staff and their manager Nan Anderson at the council#s Ardfenaig care home in Ardrishaig.These people have, since the lockdown and well before that, given those in their care love and affection that is second to none.On a daily basis they put themselves in harm#s way, to the benefit of not only the residents but also the relatives of the residents, and may I personally say they do it in a professional and loving way.On behalf of those in your care, especially those who cannot say it for themselves, #Thank you and a very merry Christmas to you all#.Leonard McNeill, MinardSir,I congratulate the Scottish Government on its recent commitment to a bill that will give the role of local government legal status in Scotland.The European Charter of Local Self-Government Bill has been proposed and fought for by Andy Wightman of the Green Party. It aims to incorporate the European Charter of Local Self-Government into Scots law, setting out certain rights for councils and protecting them from centralisation.It’s been strongly supported by local government body COSLA, whose president, Councillor Alison Evison said: #This is a good day for democracy in Scotland. It is a good day for our communities.# It’s also a good day for our hard-pressed local government.Here in Argyll and Bute, I think we recognise the absolute necessity of so many of the services provided by local government for our day-to-day wellbeing.We also recognise the increasingly challenging responsibility involved in the delivery of those services, not least in the face of Covid- and the climate emergency, which both have tested us all this year.Our comings and goings have been adversely affected by both these #events#, as our social relations are constrained by the first, and our movements, our access and connectivity by the unprecedented scale of the A Rest and be Thankful landslides.Andy Wightman’s Bill,enacted, will give people a stronger voice in the conduct of their  affairs, and we will increasingly need that stronger voice to advocate for our present and our future in Argyll and Bute.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,The much-loved Erskine Tree of Honour was dedicated and lit in fine style last week.Every year the Tree of Honour dedications lead us into the festive season.This year, in spite of the pandemic, we embrace the opportunity to remember those who will be missing from our lives this Christmas.

It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people.Avian influenza is an airborne disease. It can also be spread by wild birds and rodents whose movements change in response to flooding.How can I find out more Full details are available on the Scottish Government website here."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-railway-feasibility-study-extension-moves-closer","story":"AN extension of the Borders Railway into England will be looked at, now that relevant funding has been accelerated.A feasibility study into connecting the regionrsquos train line across the border will be held after it was confirmed that investment into Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal projects would be delivered over  years rather than .The UK and Scottish Government-deal aims to improve places and infrastructure, encourage green growth and support innovation, business and skills across five council areas, including the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.:Borders school wins silver prize in international competitionShona Haslam, the council leader and co-chairperson on the Borderlands Partnership Board, says the deal will have a ldquotransformational impact by creating , jobs and bringing in more than four million tourists.She said: ldquoThe unlocking of investment in our towns will generate a predicted pound.billion uplt in the regionrsquos GVA and the partners will be able to deliver inidually and collectively a range of projects which will not only improve the area for existing residents but also encourage more to move here, which will help address some of the common challenges we face.The feasibility study will look into the extension of the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Carlisle.At a full council meeting before the announcement was made, Hawick councillor Davie Paterson described the extension as ldquoparamount.:Luxury Bentley cars get tweed interior from the BordersThe councilrsquos executive director, Rob Dickson, told the meeting that although the rail extension \"is not explicitly contained within the councils economic development priorities report, the connection across the Border is a part of future plans.ldquoIt clearly is a priority to try and move on the feasibility study for extending the Borders Railway, said Mr Dickson.ldquoThere is funding committed to that feasibility study and clearlywe can secure a deal early next year then that will allow us to accelerate the feasibility study."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-gets-50-new-cases-weekend","story":"THE Borders has recorded  coronavirus cases over the weekend.Updated figures were released by the Scottish Government at pm today .The total number of people in the region who have tested positive since March now stands at ,.There are  people in hospital in the Borders with the virus, six more than on Friday .Across Scotland,  cases were announced in the last  hours and , people are in hospital with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-rate-borders-doubles-within-fortnight","story":"THE coronavirus infection rate in the Borders has more than doubled within a fortnight, according to new figures.The latest data published by Public Health Scotlandtodayshows that, between December  and December , the region recorded a rate of . new cases per , of the population.This marks a rise from the rate between November  and December , which was ..Among the  Borders neighbourhoods shown on the PHS interactive map, the highest rates are in lsquoCheviot Eastrsquo and lsquoColdstream and Arearsquo ndash both have a rate of -

It cost the lives of  British servicemen and severe injuries to many more but it made Blair a rich man, resulting from his popularity in America where many of my friends still think the sun shines from his posterior.I would agree, however, that allowing the electorate in Scotland to vote in favour of devolution, was undoubtedly Blair#s second biggest mistake.His motivation was to placate those crying for Scottish independence, following the discovery of North Sea oil, but the irony was that it led to a series of disastrously incompetent Labour Lib Dem coalition governments.These in turn resulted in the electorate choosing, in , a minority SNP government, enabled by support from the Greens.My letter would be far too long were I to dwell on all the areas of incompetence in Holyrood government since , so I#ll confine my evaluation to education, upon which the future of Scotland depends.In , Salmond#s election promise was primary school class sizes of under  but, two years later, Fiona Hyslop changed that target to fewer than  pupils. That was just before Salmond sacked her and Mike Russell admitted smaller class sizes might not be possible before .Those councils that did enforce the limit of  only did so by refusing places to children whose siblings were at the same school.The #attainment gap# between children from poorer backgrounds and those from more affluent areas has continued to widen rather than diminish, as Nicola Sturgeon promised, while older students cannot find places at Scottish universities because these have to be allocated to foreign students, whose fees are a necessity to fund the universities.Meanwhile, I hate to think what Scotland#s deficit is now. It was around eight per cent of GDP before Covid decimated so many areas vital to Scotland#s economy.Doubtless, Alex Orr will remind me Scotland cannot legally have a deficit, but an independent Scotland could and it would prevent the dream of Scotland rejoining the EU from ever being attained.Brian Gee, Carradale East.In the recent storms,  houses at Bruach Gorm, Port Charlotte using the communal West Highland Housing Association satellite dish, lost half our Sky channels, including BBC  and STV.As I write, it’s been  working days since at least three of us that I know reported the issue to West Highland, but not a word of a fix date.The dish has done well for  years, but things degrade over time. I had an inkling this year there would be a dish problem and in the summer I bought a TV aerial kit for £ – a lot cheaper than fitting a dish. I put the aerial in the loft and there is a good reception, with BBC  and STV back. It is storm-proof in the loft, though I was disappointed with the lack of channels from the Bowmore transmitter.I Googled it and the mast is a Freeview Light and lacks channels other UK areas enjoy. I use Sky HD freeview channels but with Sky you have to navigate the TV guide through all the blocked subscription channels to find the one you want to watch. Via the Bowmore mast, the TV guide just lists the freeview channels, which is great.Freeview said that there are more channels available on main transmitters than there is on relay transmitters, which play a vital role in providing more remote areas a TV coverage.There are a lot of aerials on houses and I think Islay’s TV transmitters should get an upgrade to the same channels as other areas expect.I will also raise this issue with those elected to improve our lives, including MSP, MP, council leader Councillor Currie and Councillor Horn.Colin M Campbell, Port Charlotte, Islay.I think we all need a boost of positive news, so I would like to appeal to your readers to give a brave and special young person in your area the credit they deserve by nominating them for the  WellChild Awards.We are looking for inspirational children and young people who have defied the odds in the face of serious illness and the selfless nurses, doctors, brothers, sisters and friends who help care for them.This is your opportunity to give them the recognition they deserve at a prestigious event regularly attended by WellChild Patron, The Duke of Sussex.Nominations are open now so please get yours in before the closing date on Monday December  at noon.

A guide will also be available in the village shops.In this way, we hope to brighten the preparation for Christmas for everyone.More than , children are admitted to hospital every day in the UK and it has never been a scarier time for them.With unfamiliar wards, health professionals in additional PPE, only being able to have one parent with them, and no visits from their brothers or sisters during the pandemic, it can be very worrying and lonely.That is why play and distraction services in hospitals are now more vital than ever. Having access to toys and entertainment, when recovering or waiting for treatment, or using play as a distraction for procedures can help to alleviate pain, aid recovery and bring joy back into children’s lives.At the children’s charity Starlight, thanks to our supporters, we provide hospitals with boxes filled with toys, games and puzzles to be used on wards.This year, Starlight’s fundraising income has fallen due to many cancelled events, which is why we have started our Time to Play campaign. Our goal is to raise £, before the end of the year to help , children get access to play in hospital and limit the negative effects of illness on their childhood.It’s easy to support and our website has fun ideas of how to take part, including our Stream for Starlight fundraiser for computer gamers.Or,you are able to, please considering making a simple one-off donation. However big or small, it will help Starlight to continue to be there to support children and their families this Christmas.I’m hoping your readers will join together and help support Starlight, to bring back joy into the lives of the , seriously ill children living in the UK this Christmas.Please visit www.starlight.org.uk time to help us. Thank you.Every year thousands of children contact Childline about being bullied online and tell us that they feel it is hard to escape from.Lockdown has intensied these feelings for many and since April we’ve counselled more than , children and young people across the UK about online bullying.Children have told us about people sending threatening or abusive messages and being pressured into engaging in sexual conversations. Others have shared that they’ve been excluded from online games by other children, while some spoke of online identities being stolen to embarrass or cause trouble while using their name.Before lockdown measures were first introduced this year, the average monthly number of counselling sessions with children about online bullying was . Between April and October that value increased by  per cent to a monthly average of .This is worrying, particularly as we continue to adhere to strict social-distancing restrictions across Scotland and children continue to spend more time online. Bullying can have a long-term impact on the mental wellbeing of a child and, as we mark Anti Bullying Week this month and beyond, it’s important to ensure that every child knows who they can turn to for support.If a parent thinks their child is being bullied online, it can be hard to remain calm, but it’s crucial not to overwhelm a child with questions. Taking their device away is likely to make them feel like whatever has happened is their fault instead, it’s helpful to listen to their worries, suggest they take some time away from certain apps, and provide them with reassurance.Adeniyi Alade, service head of Childline at NSPCC Scotland.Boris Johnson’s comment that devolution has been #a disaster north of the border# and #Tony Blair’s worst mistake# should hardly come as a surprise to anyone.The Tories have never been great supporters of devolution, vehemently opposing both the referendums in  on establishing a Scottish Assembly and in  on the Scottish Parliament.Most recently the devolution power grab that is highlighted in the Internal Market Bill simply reinforces this stance.The Scottish Social Attitudes surveyon constitutional preference found that only seven per cent favour abolition of the Scottish Parliament and it found that trust in the Scottish Government sits at four times that of the UK Government. This points to it hardly being a disaster.For those accused of scaremongering that there is a threat to Holyrood, Mr Johnson’s comments are clear vindication. The irony of all this being that devolution has given new le to the Scottish Conservatives after its wipe out in  and it is now the opposition in the Scottish Parliament.Be under no doubt that the Scottish Parliament, which was hard fought for, is under threat and we must do all in our power to defend it.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.While this year Christmas is going to be dferent from usual for many of us, it is still a time for preparations and extra food.

Usually we look forward to the Christmas lights and decorations brightening up the dark winter nights and bringing hope and cheer.This year, we wait and wonder.

We watch the news and hope restrictions will be eased, but we are afraid of that too, as this could lead to the virus spreading. So we wait and watch and wonder – a bit like the shepherds of old, gathered on the hillside, waiting and watching and wondering.It has been a tough few months and for many it has been a gruelling and harrowing few months.How do we celebrate in such times Yet, I have heard so many people say: #Well I’m going to put up my tree and I’m going to do it early to bring some cheer into our lives.#We are a people of hope, even in the darkest days.We wait in the darkness for we know that even the darkest night has the first streaks of dawn to lighten the sky.So as we approach the time of preparing to welcome the Christ child once again, we will wait hopefully."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 18 follow me","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

For every dozen sold, p will be donated to the girls# fund.When staff at Jura Community Store, one of the shops selling the eggs, found out about the appeal, they decided that for every dozen eggs they sell in pink boxes, they will donate an additional p to Children st.Wearing T-shirts bearing the Children st logo and colours, the girls set off from Aqualibrium last Sunday morning, and were joined throughout their journey by Jessica#s big sister Adelle and her friend Jade McCallum, as well as Jessica and Adelle#s parents.Many friends and family members turned out to cheer and clap for the girls and there was even a special, hand-made banner which read: #Well done, girls!#Despite a drizzly shower, the weather was largely pleasant, meaning the girls could enjoy a few pit stops on their journey.They were welcomed at the finish line with balloons, cake, hot chocolate, medals and gts.The girls# parents said: #They smiled, danced and sang the whole way and, as they did, they spoke about the children and families they would be helping and how their Christmas might be now, as a result of the fantastic amount of money raised.#They were absolute stars and did so well. We could all see the pride bursting out of them which was lovely.#As always, friends, family and our community have just been so kind and supportive.

He decided to donate the proceeds from his November fundraising to Kintyre Link Club.The #take five# challenge was created so others could join in by walking, running or doing the exercise of their choice, to raise additional sponsorship for the club.Tom decided to participate in a bid to repay some of the financial and emotional support he has received from Kintyre Link Club.He was joined on Monday by a troupe of supporters, many of whom also took part in the #take five# challenge throughout November.Tom told the Courier: #I suffer with a lot of mental health problems and, without the support of Kintyre Link Club and Tracy, who has been absolutely fantastic, I would have fallen into a really dark place.#Tom#s mental health deteriorated after the breakdown of a relationship, but it was his ex-partner who put him in contact with Tracy, and also sponsored him £ to take part in the challenge.He was also sponsored £ by Caroline Semple, of Campbeltown charity Shopper-Aide, whose idea it was to do the walk in drag.Tom explained: #I asked everyone to sponsor me £ and Caroline told me she would give me £I did it in drag. I couldn’t do it in drag every day – it would be too inconvenient to get my make up done # but I suggested doing the last day in drag and she said fair enough, she#d sponsor me £.#Tom has raised between £ and £ in total.#People have been really generous,# he said. #I hoped I would raise £ but it spiralled and people started offering me more and more money, especiallyI did it in drag.#He received help from Beckie Shields, also from Shopper-Aide, who applied his glamorous make-up ahead of Monday#s walk.He added: #Finding the motivation to get out the house can be really dficult, so having this challenge was brilliant it did me the world of good.#I think I will keep up the walking – not seven days a week but maybe Monday to Friday.

There are only two criteria: the narrative of the short story must take place on the island and the story should have a link to one of the many myths and legends about Jura.The finished product will be published on the Isle of Jura#s website.TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOShip launch boost for CampbeltownAn estimated £, was pumped into the Kintyre economy last weekend with the naming of a new class of Stern trawler at Campbeltown shipyard.Around  guests travelled to Campbeltown for the naming of the latest addition to the fleet of Peterhead-based George Moodie and Sons Trawlers Ltd, Shemarah II.They came in coaches and occupied a large number of hotel rooms in and around Campbeltown.The . metre trawler was named by Mrs Jenner Moodie. It was the th addition to the family#s fleet she has named.Piper Derek Wilson of Kintyre District Pipe Band played a selection of tunes before the naming took place.Mr Douglas Moodie said at the naming: ‘She is lovely. We had a number of quotes from overseas to build her but we wanted to keep the work in Scotland.’Other guests at the naming included Sir William Lithgow and his we Lady Lithgow, Argyll and Bute MP Mrs Ray Michie, Argyll and Bute District Council chairman George McMillan and district Councillor Archie McCallum.FIFTY YEARS AGOUnique legal historyMaking his first appearance as a solicitor at Campbeltown Sherf Court on Friday was Mr Patrick Stewart, son of procurator fiscal, Mr A I B Stewart.Mr Stewart is the third generation to act as a solicitor in Campbeltown. His grandfather was Mr Archibald Stewart.Appearing with him was Mr John Mactaggart, son of Mr Charles Mactaggart. Mr Mactaggart is the fth generation in direct descent to work as a solicitor.There are older legal firms in Scotland than C and D Mactaggart, but none with a record of five generations in direct descent.Campbeltown is probably the only town in Scotland with such legal history. The stability of the legal profession in Scotland owes much to such family tradition.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCampbeltownIn the gale of third December, a boat of the Campbeltown fishing fleet belonging to Mr James Wareham was totally lost at Lochranza.The crew had just discharged the cargo at the pier when the gale burst upon them. The sea was so heavy that the crew had to jump ashore for their lives and look helplessly at the boat being smashed to matchwood.The only salvage is the motor engine. Given the present state of the fishing industry and the high cost of boats, the loss will be seriously felt.Gigha A meeting of the education authority for the County of Argyll was held in Glasgow on Thursday November th. Major AJM Bennett, Dunoon, chairman presided.The committee agreed with the Kintyre District Education Committee that it is not desirable, in view of the present cost of building, to erect a cookery room at Gigha public school as recommended by the local school management committee.JuraThe sad news of the death of Neil Cameron, youngest son of Mr and Mrs Cameron, Skervuile Lighthouse, Jura, has caused the greatest sorrow among his many friends on the island and at Oban where he was employed for two years on the Northern Lighthouse steamer Hesperus and held in high esteem by the captain and crew.Anxious to advance in his calling, he joined the SS Strathlore of the Strath Line in July last and made a voyage to the West Indies where he accidentally met his death.The deceased was a young man of excellent character and genial disposition and his abilities would doubtless have brought him to a high place in his profession had he been spared.Many expressions of sympathy have been received by his sorrowing father, mother, sister and brother in the great and sudden sorrow.CAPTION:A  advertisement encourages Courier readers to get their pocket lamps #put in order# at MacGeachy#s in Union Street.

There are plainly the financial resources to deal with this.It is an inexcusable dereliction of duty on their part and will not be forgiven or forgotten by people whose jobs and livelihoods are being threatened by this ongoing crisis.Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands Region.I was happy to hear from my constituents when I was out and about in Bowmore again recently.Many pressing  matters were raised including the poor condition of pavements, faultily street lights at Stanalane and potholes on Shore St and Jamieson St.The recent vandalism of the hand sanitiser dispenser within the bus shelter is as worrying as it is unacceptable.All of these matters and more have been raised with the appropriate department and I will continue to lobby relentlessly for better infrastructure across the Kintyre and the Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.I see Claudia Winkleman is to be paid £ million for her #work#.While I am sure she is a capable broadcaster, and may be worth a good salary, surely £ million is extracting the liquid.I have calculated that this sum amounts to ,  free television licences for the over-s. When you then think of other celebrities earning mouth-watering sums from the BBC, this gives clear evidence that the BBC could quite easily continue with the free television licences for the over-s.My income does not qualy for pension credit by a small margin but I have now had two communications from TV Licensing reminding me to pay the fee.Each time it encloses a brochure and ious forms to complete in the hope that I feel empowered to pay the £. required to watch TV.So far, I have decided to weather the storm and not pay. My hope is that thousands of over-s do likewise and Auntie will realise that expecting us to fall into line is not as simple as it expects.Silver Voices continue to pressure the BBC to think again and reinstate free licences for the over-s.It has my full support and will continue to do so until the BBC bites the bullet and cancels its continued harassment of OAPs.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.For many of us, the festive season is a time for giving and sharing, which is why we’re inviting you to celebrate Giving Tuesday.I’d like to take a moment to share with your readers how, in choosing to give to our charity, Revitalise, you’ll be making a real dference to the lives of the disabled people and carers that we support.As a charity we know that however tricky this past year has been, le is about spending time with the people we love, and everyday le can so easily get in the way of that. Hilary has cared for her son Shaun since he had an accident on holiday in Ibiza, aged .Caring is simply something she does for the person she loves. As she explains: #For the last  years I’ve been caring for Shaun but I definitely wouldn’t call myself a carer, it’s just something I do as his mum.#I’m never, ever, going to give up on my son. Le is too short you know you need to keep fighting.#On top of the dficulties this year has presented, disabled people and the elderly have also been left with far less support than usual, as the Emergency Coronavirus Act allowed local authorities to axe their duty of care responsibilities. Feeling vulnerable and abandoned, many carers are close to breaking point.#This is why we have launched our campaign, Care For Carers and the fundraiser Raise a Million, aiming to raise £ million to support carers and their loved ones to access respite care breaks following lockdown.We have provided respite care breaks # a vital leline to so many unpaid home carers and their disabled loved ones # for over  years.So, in celebration of Giving Tuesday this month, why not pledge to give something special to our charity this festive season I am so proud to work for Revitalise as we amply the voice of carers, and will continue to do so until carers stories are heard. Please support our campaignyou can, and help us spread the word about the struggles carers are facing right now.To find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or the ways that we may be able to support guests, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Devon Prosser, Revitalise"},{"url":null,"title":"paving the way for a future in sport","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The moon lit up the landscape and the whole earth breathed peace.The only sound was the quiet lapping as the ocean rolled its waves once again to the shore. The darkness was penetrated by billions of pinpricks of light, reminding me that light has the last word.We are waiting for the lighter nights. We are waiting for the ening days. We are waiting for the light. We are waiting for the light, and for the le light.We wait quietly in a cosmic silence. Waiting can bring peace as we find God’s presence in the present. Waiting can bring hope as we know the light will come.But it’s hard to stop and wait it’s not easy to pause and ponder it’s dficult to take time at this time.

A proud day and proud moment in the history of the local club.A number of famous players have worn the Pupils’ white jersey in bygone days, notably amateur and junior internationalist the Rev BB Blackwood, John Duran, captain of Swansea City, Hugh Smith of Sheffield Wednesday and the incredible Johnny Moscardini # capped nine times for Italy.The Wee Toon also had players who appeared at full international level for Scotland, with Peter Purcell of Glasgow Rangers and Neil McBain of Manchester United, Everton and Liverpool the pick of the crop.The club would like to recognise the contribution these players made to local football with a photographic record at the park, the same to include the club’s more modern luminaries who achieved senior football and amateur international recognition after gracing the green swathes of Kintyre Park.Finally, the club would like to thank everyone who contributed to the project, including members of the public who selected its cause and gave freely to it.Also, the ious trusts, businesses, grant authorities and community support funds like Energiekontor UK, Scottish Football Partnership, the late Maisie Wareham, Machrihanish Airbase Community Company, Tesco Bags of Help Groundwork UK, Cooperative Community Fund, The Rotary Club of Campbeltown, Campbeltown Community Council Tangy  Windfarm, Campbeltown Common Good Fund and Campbeltown Loyal Rangers Supporters Club.The spokesperson added: #A special mention must go to our many supporters whose backing provides welcome encouragement throughout the year, our main sponsor, McFadyen Contractors Ltd, for y and invaluable financial and technical assistance, Phoenix Motors, and Jim and Carol Green of the Feathers Inn for hospitality and sponsorship, James and Elaine the Kilbrannan Bar, Mick at the Ailsa, Robert at Kinloch Bar, Wee Toon Trends and Galbraith and Cochrane’s for assistance rendered with our weekly lottery.

Instead, we often do a night tour of the streets looking at the Christmas lights so many people have made the effort to display.Weekends have become our time to explore the woods and on Saturday the weather allowed us to venture out, after a few days of rain. We knew it would be muddy, and the trees bare of leaves, but we were on the hunt for holly and ivy to make our Christmas wreath and decorate the house.Itrsquos only when you venture into a wood in winter time that you fully appreciate the display of green that holly and ivy provides. They are naturersquos Christmas lights of colour, a gt of green in a sleeping wood that has lost most of its colour.I have written before about the mental health benefits of ldquoforest bathing, and for me regular visits to nature and walking amongst trees have always been a vital part of my mental wellbeing. And so as we ventured forth to a wood in East Lothian after days of being cooped up inside, I could feel my spirit lt.We arrived as the sun was already lowering in the winter sky. We had just two hours for our adventure and so we headed down into the wood.The sound of the Sauchet Water, which runs through the wood, reached us before we could see it. The rain of previous days had turned it into a tumbling river. I had hoped for this, as the sound of running water in naturersquos setting is so therapeutic. The kids stood by the bank, watching and listening to the river as it flowed past them, mesmerised by the sight and sound of it. I watched them as they stood together, saying nothing, but sharing the moment.After a few minutes, they came out of their trance and headed deeper into the wood to seek adventure. Our task was to find nice branches of holly and some ivy, but also to seek out the stories of the wood.And they found a story. A tree was in danger of falling because the river had eroded the bank. One side of its root system was exposed, with nothing to hold on to, so the tree was leaning towards the water, in danger of falling. But a neighbouring tree looked asit had come to the rescue. Its trunk was bending towards the tree in danger, giving it something to lean on.The kids called them the lsquoslipping treersquo and the lsquohelping treersquo. And when we looked at the roots of the two trees, we could see that they were, as my son described it, ldquoholding hands. I could see what he meant, for the roots of the lsquoslipping treersquo looked asthey were indeed holding onto the roots of the lsquohelping treersquo.Perhaps this was all their creative imagination, although there is clear scientic evidence that trees in a wood need each other and help each other in many dferent ways, especially via their underground root system. Andyou really look at trees, you will see the stories of their challenges, and of their resilience and survival in the face of them.The kids moved on in their adventure, but I paused for a moment at these two trees. There was a story here that spoke to me so directly in this most challenging of times: that we need to hold hands like this sometimes, by seeking and accepting the help of otherswe feel ourselves slipping. But also, we need to be able to recognise when someone  is quietly slipping and help them hold on.ldquoCome on, dad, we have found a perfect holly bush, the kids called out. My we Kate and I scrambled up the muddy slope to see, and sure enough they had.There is understandably a wealth of folklore and tradition about holly. Itrsquos said to be bad luck to cut the tree down but taking a small branch is OK, as long as you thank the tree.By this time, darkness was falling and the wood was feeling eerie, but in a good way. Part of exploring nature should be the enchantment of it, the mysteries it holds, and it being a bit scary at times is part of this.The bare branches of the trees silhouetted against a darkening sky was the perfect theatre to end our adventure, as the kids kept an eye out for faeries and malevolent magical creatures, which they knew would be kept at bay as long as they held onto their holly branches.We emerged from the wood into the dying light of the winterrsquos day, decorated with holly and ivy like figures from mythology ourselves.Such was our adventure last weekend. I felt so much better after the walk. Yes, it was the physical exercise and fresh air, but it was also the spiritual uplt a visit to the woods always gives, even in winter.And part of this,we choose to notice and listen, will be naturersquos stories, which can speak directly to us."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-8-11-1995-1970-1920","story":"A FAMOUS landmark atop North Berwick Law was in need of repair, reported the East Lothian Courier of December , .The whalersquos jawbone at the summit of North Berwick Law is to be repaired at a cost of about pound.The condition of the well-known local landmark has deteriorated over the decades and the townrsquos community councillors are keen to ensure it is saved for posterity.They approached the district council with their concerns and Macmerry-based specialists Ralph Plastics was contracted to do the job.They will restore the jawbone with fibre glass, and the protective railings around it will be repaired by Daw Engineering of Fenton Barns.Scaffolding will have to be used to carry out the work and the equipment will be taken up the hill by a tractor vehicle ndash a far cry from the mode of transport used to get the jawbone to the top in the s.lsquoWANTED,  beds for touring cyclistsrsquo was a headline in The Haddingtonshire Courier on December , .The Scottish Milk Race will again be passing through Dunbar on July , .The race took Dunbar into its tour of the country two years ago and caused great excitement.The only problem is where to put all the cyclists, race officials and representatives of the Milk Marketing Board when they arrive ndash  beds are needed.Co-operation is being asked for from local people and those living within a -mile radius of the town.MEANWHILE, power cuts hit the county.Scenes reminiscent of the wartime blackout were re-created in East Lothian this week when ious parts of the County were suddenly plunged into darkness by power cuts.Ironmongers, grocers and little general dealers shops found themselves almost besieged by customers clamouring for candles, paraffin and flashlight batteries.Those in the Tranent area were the first to feel the effects.A NEW bus service was introduced in Tranent, the first of its kind.

See Scotlandrsquos declaration https:t.co XysTYvGyQ @RuralMattersSG pic cePuUsgZHow to spot bird flu Avian influenza viruses can be classied according to their ability to cause severe disease as either highly pathogenic or low pathogenic.Low pathogenic bird flu is often dficult to detect, with very few clinical signs.According to the Scottish Government, an infected flock might show signs of respiratory distress, diarrhoea, or a drop in egg production.Highly pathogenic avian influenza will often form symptoms more suddenly, with affected birds developing swollen heads, a blue colouration of the comb and wattles, respiratory distress, diarrhoea, and a signicant drop in egg production.The Scottish Government guidance saysyou are suspicious your flock has any form of avian influenza you must contact your local animal health office immediately.What to doyou find a dead or sick wild birdAccording to Scottish Government guidance, wild birds can carry several diseases that are infectious to people, so do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find.If you find a single dead bird of prey, gull or wildfowl species , or find five or more birds of any other species in the same location and at the same time, you should report these incidents to Defrarsquos national telephone helpline .How is bird flu spread The disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contaminated body fluids and faeces. It can also be spread by contaminated feed and water or by dirty vehicles, clothing and footwear.The avian influenza virus changes frequently, creating new strains, and there is a constant risk that one of the new strains may spread easily among people. But there is no evidence that any recent strain of avian influenza has been able to spread directly between people.Avian influenza is an airborne disease. It can also be spread by wild birds and rodents whose movements change in response to flooding.How can I find out more Full details are available on the Scottish Government website here."},{"url":null,"title":"families-eligible-free-school-meals-get-extra-payments-totalling-100","story":"The council said that two additional payments would be made in the coming weeks, totalling pound per child.A payment of pound per pupil will be made to cover the Christmas holiday period when schools are closed, representing the cost of free school meals during this -day period.The payment will be automatically credited to parentsrsquo bank accounts from December , the council said.A second winter support payment of pound per pupil will be made next week.Households already registered for free school meals will have the money automatically credited to the bank account details that the council currently holds on file ndash no further action or application is required.Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoThis will be welcome news for many families who have faced financial challenges over the course of this year.\"These payments mean that families who most need support with food will not miss out over the Christmas period when our schools are closed for the break.\"The winter support payment will be useful for warm clothing and other necessities to help them through the season.ldquoIrsquod urge anyone who is eligible for free school meals but has not yet registered to do so now.Free school meals are offered for children and young people from P to S.

Despite commanding immense power, its government is prone to taking childish offence at real or imagined slights by foreigners. We saw an example recently when Chinese agents posted doctored images of an Australian soldier apparently murdering an Afghan child. The Australians had aroused Beijingrsquos wrath by calling for an independent UN investigation into the origins of Covid in Wuhan.China has refused to countenance any investigation not conducted by its own agencies, which are of course, directly answerable to the Chinese Communist Party . Inkster is satisfied that, while China did not invent coronavirus, it tried to cover it up. Chinese authorities delayed informing the World Health Organisation about the spread of Covid- in Wuhan and gave misleading assurances that it was not being transmitted between humans.This kind of secrecy comes naturally to an authoritarian state in which officials fear losing their privileges ndash or worse. The death penalty is still widely used in China, which, according to Amnesty International, executes more people than the rest of the world combined.When they finally admitted to the scale of the epidemic, the Chinese authorities instigated a military-style lockdown of Hubei province and its ,, inhabitants. It worked. A year on, China appears to have virtually eliminated the disease.Indeed, as Western economies sink into post-Covid depression, China is once again powering ahead. Inkster fears that the pandemic could mark a major milestone towards what is called the ldquoChinese Dream of global economic hegemony. This would be secured partly through the Belt and Road Initiative ndash a  trillion network of infrastructure and client states being established by China across the world, often through a kind of semi-colonial debt servitude among countries like Sri Lanka. It would also involve the Digital Silk Road: Chinas project to become a technological superpower and remake the internet in its image. The state-backed telecoms giant, Hauwei, is seeking to establish global Chinese dominance of the means of communication through providing the infrastructure of G telephony.Inkster writes that China is also determined to become a world leader in articial intelligence , having spent billions on the means of technological surveillance and control. It is a world leader in facial recognition. Every signicant public space in this vast country is being placed under -hour AI-enabled video scrutiny according to Inkster, who says Chinese citizens routinely receive text messages informing them that they have been fined for petty crimes such as jay-walking or dropping litter.Under the Orwellian Social Credit system, . billion Chinese citizens are each being given digital score-cards indicating how good they have been. Being a good citizen in China means paying taxes, working hard and of course, not criticising the government. Speech is tightly regulated. All this is justied in terms of supposedly Confucian virtues of respect for authority, community solidarity and civil order.China has made a mockery of claims that the internet would break down national borders and undermine authoritarian governments. Its bureaucrats realised early on that the reverse is true: the internet allows for greater social control than analogue dictators like Stalin could ever have dreamed of. In , Bill Clinton famously said trying to control the internet would be \"like nailing jello to the wall\". ldquoA decade later, says Inkster, ldquoChinese walls were covered in jello.First of all, they set up the Golden Shield project, known in the West as the Great Firewall of China, to block externally-generated content. China now has the worlds largest online user community and digital economy through Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, the CCP-controlled versions of Google, Amazon and Facebook. The internet has become a means of monitoring and suppressing all forms of intellectual dissent.Yetmodern China sounds like hell on earth, Inkster says there is widespread public acceptance of this degree of social control. People feel secure. There is less crime, pornography and hate speech. Freedom of thought, democracy and inidualism are seen as alien vices that can lead to chaos and unhappiness. Mind you, in such a tightly-controlled country, can anyone claim to know what people really think  Are ordinary Chinese people genuinely happy or just acting the part for the cameras The absence of overt dissent may be largely a product of thought control. There is certainly no shortage of dissent right now in Hong Kong, Tibet or amongst the one million persecuted Uighurs in Xinjian province being held in re-education camps. There is the bitter memory of Tiananmen Square in  when hundreds, perhaps thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators were killed by Chinese troops.President Xi believes the surest way to avoid dissent in future is to deliver economic growth and a consumer society. The Chinese economic miracle is genuine enough. From an essentially peasant society  years ago, itrsquos become the worldrsquos second-largest economy, and likely to soon surpass the USA. That this capitalist economic miracle has happened under communist government may appear to be one of the great paradoxes of modern history. However, since the days of Mao Zedong, the interests of the CCP have always come first and socialism second. If political stability requires a dose of Western capitalism, so be it.Decades of double-digit growth were based on cheap labour and regimented working practices ndash plus, according to Inkster, a rigged exchange rate, unfair trading practices, theft of intellectual property on ldquoan industrial scale, and ruthless exploitation of the environment. Chinas growth was based on coal and it still mines half of all the coal in the world despite promises to reach net-zero by . Inkster says % of Chinas arable land is polluted by heavy metals.But these issues donrsquot figure in public debate. The ldquoglass heart social media campaigns, combined with the so-called ldquowolf warrior approach to diplomacy, has precluded critical scrutiny of rapacious Chinese capitalism even in the West. President Xi is now turning to modernising the Chinese army, already the largest in the world. China is challenging Americarsquos military presence in the South Pacic and remains determined to annex Taiwan. This Great Decoupling, as Inkster calls it, is unlikely to end well.An adviser to the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, Inkster used to work for MI. Perhaps this has coloured his view of China. The book reads more like a charge sheet than a dispassionate assessment of Chinas new world standing. But the central message ndash that this profoundly regimented and authoritarian country is about to achieve global economic and military hegemony ndash is sound, well-documented and a disturbing challenge to the West as it emerges, battered, from the Covid nightmare."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12135586.jpg?type=article-full","title":"unveiled-new-filmhouse-world-class-centre-film-create-300-jobs","story":"The move for the proposed New Filmhouse in Festival Square, Edinburgh are being pushed forward following a four month consultation period.The Centre for the Moving Image, the charity which incorporates the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and the Filmhouse in Edinburgh, that put forward the proposals, hope thatapproved, construction will begin in  and that it will be complete in .By  , the development is expected to sustain  full-time equivalent jobs and pound.m of revenue that otherwise would not exist in Edinburgh.They say the \"landmark home for Filmhouse and the Edinburgh International Film Festival\" is now with the City of Edinburgh Council for consideration.It include five screens, a theatre, rooftop restaurant and event space, and would be built in Festival Square, beside the Sheraton Hotel.A decision is expected by early summer .The news comes despite cinemas being badly hit in the Covid- crisis.The UK box office is unlikely to reach poundm this year, compared with pound.bn last year.

May this grim figure remind us all to continue observing the regulations on social distancing for as long as they may be needed.Kenneth Fraser, St Andrews.LET INSPECTORS GO BACK TO TEACHINGA RECURRING major concern throughout the current crisis has been the progress and welfare of our young people in schools. One of the major issues has been the disruption to normal teaching and learning brought on by Covid affecting all involved in our schools: pupils, teachers and support staff. Repeatedly I have read of the need to recruit additional teachers to assist in these unique times.One area which, as far as I know, has not been sourced is staring the Government in the face. Our Inspectorate is currently not inspecting schools. This looks likely to be the continuing scenario well into  and possibly beyond the summer recess. Seven more months, at least, of these highly qualied and well respected teachers not performing the tasks they normally carry out.What an opportunity to bring their expertise directly into the classrooms. They would bring great skills, breadth of experience and the love of young people which they clearly will have demonstrated to attain their present positions. To have such highly qualied and skilled practitioners at the disposal of our young people but not to utilise them borders on negligence.Taking the possibility one step further, what an opening to place such expertise and experience into the most disadvantaged areas. Closing the attainment gap is an aim constantly sought. Utilising the Inspectorate with such a focus must present a heaven-sent chance in these hellish times.Having worked closely with Inspectorate colleagues in more than  years of senior leadership in secondary schools, I can attest to the quality these colleagues have to offer our young people.Rod OrsquoDonnell, Milngavie.IN TUNE WITH THE TIMESREGARDING Christmas songs : we will not be Driving Home for Christmas because Therersquos Something in the Air.Thank you.

In a testing, tumultuous year, in which those behind the scenes at the European Tour deserve tremendous credit for salvaging a season from the ravaging impacts and logistical complexities of coronavirus, it was fitting that a trusty stalwart of the European scene earned the prize and the plaudits in his thevent on the circuit.Westwood is such a part of the European Tourrsquos fabric, theyrsquoll probably bring out a commemorative tapestry to mark the occasion. That he hosted this yearrsquos British Masters at Close House, the first European Tour event to be staged after emerging from the coronavirus shutdown, once again underlined his admirable commitment to the tour that made him.The Ryder Cup stalwart finished second behind his young compatriot, Matthew Fitzpatrick, in the season-ending DP World Tour Championship on Sunday but it was enough to see him pip Fitzpatrick to the cherished No  perch.Just to make Westwood feel that little bit older, Fitzpatrick was just one of  winners on the European Tour this year who were born after Westwood began his rookie campaign in . Such a statistic simply emphasises Westwoodrsquos remarkable durability and unquenchable competitive drooth amid the youth movement.The advancing years, of course, have never been a barrier to success in this great generation game. There may be a few niggles here, the odd hirple there and one or two eye-watering twinges goodness knows where but the well-worn cranks, pulleys and pistons are still, by and large, in good working order.ldquoThe lads in the physio unit have stretched me in places I didnrsquot think I had, said Westwood with an admission that evokes some deliciously appalling imagery.With  global wins, including  European Tour titles and two PGA Tour victories, as well as a glittering Ryder Cup record and career-earnings that would make Rockefeller look like Albert Steptoe, Westwoodrsquos motivation is unwavering. ldquoThe motivationrsquos never changed, really, he said of an entrenched drive and determination which, among many achievements, saw him top the world rankings in  after plummeting to th on the global order a few years earlier. ldquoI get up each day and do the job I love. Irsquove always wanted to be a golfer and I donrsquot want it to end.Westwood will be  next April.

Ofgem agreed to look into the concerns raised, and reiterated that all customers must be treated equally and have a right to switch regardless of their meter. The parliamentarians have welcomed Ofgem willingness to investigate matters but have warned this must not be “a token gesture”.Ms Wishart said: “This was a constructive meeting. Ofgem seemed to finally recognise that poor practices in the energy market are not isolated incidents. Instead there are wholesale issues with price increases and customer service affecting too many customers. Ofgem agreed to investigate matters further and I look forward to further discussion with them in the New Year. The regulator has reiterated that everyone has a right to switch, even with a restricted meter – and that energy suppliers who suggest otherwise are wrong.“Agreeing to this action cannot be a token gesture. We need to see a serious probe into unfair practices affecting people in the Shetland.”Mr Carmichael said: “Today’s meeting was a step in the right direction and I look forward to hearing on future progress from Ofgem in the coming weeks and months. Islanders deserve fair treatment and confidence that the regulator is keeping a close eye on suppliers. This may not be the end of poor behaviour by energy companies but I am hopeful that we will see a more hands-on approach from Ofgem as we move forward.”An Ofgem spokesperson said: “Ofgem’s rules require energy suppliers to treat all customers fairly.  “Customers with restricted meters should be able to shop around for suitable single-rate tarfs without having to change their existing metering arrangements.“Suppliers must offer their single rate tarfs to customers with restricted meters who meet the necessary requirements of those tarfs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He therefore called for similar support to be made available to protect the future of Orkney’s leline ferry services.In response, Mr Wheelhouse said that through discussions between Transport Scotland and local authority ferry operators it was decided that funding pressures as a result of COVID- should be addressed through engagement with COSLA. This was part of a wider ask from local authorities on COVID-related support, which he understood was still ongoing.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “The board of Orkney Ferries made crystal clear in a letter to the Scottish Government in August that there is a grave risk to the future of these leline services due to the level of losses sustained this year.  However, despite the severity of the situation, the appeal has so far fallen on deaf ears.“While emergency support has rightly been provided for other transport services, Orkney’s ferry services continue to face considerable uncertainty and instability.  That is no way to treat a service that is a leline to our island communities.“Losses at this scale are entirely unsustainable and urgent action is needed.

On Tuesday, as part of an “urgent item” added at the very last minute to the agenda of an OIC general meeting, councillors agreed to top this up with an additional payment of £ for each child.This payment is per child, not per household, and for those families on a low income — anyone whose P- children receive a free school meal due to the universal provision will not be eligible. Therefore, for a family with three eligible children, the payment would be £.This comes after the council was offered a discretionary grant of £,, ring-fenced for tackling food poverty in the county.Proposals to immediately award a portion of this money to some of Orkney’s lowest-income families gained unanimous support from councillors.OIC Leader Councillor James Stockan said: “These are extraordinary times we are living through and our most vulnerable families in Orkney are likely to be worst hit. That is why we as a Council have universally decided to make a supplementary payment of £ on top of the Government grant.“This additional £, will come from a discretionary grant we hold from the Scottish Government. Our officials are to be commended for their swt response in ensuring this additional money will be with our most vulnerable families ahead of Christmas.Councillor Stockan also appealed for families who may be eligible for free school meals in Orkney to come forward to check to seethey qualy.“We are fearful there are families out there who are missing out on free school meals, and now these additional payments, due to a misconception of there being a stigma attached. Please be reassured the system we have in place has already been commended by other parents and carers who have applied as being subtle and ensure complete privacy.“I would urge people to please check to seeyou qualy – more people are entitled to this – this is our chance as a Council to do something additional to help iniduals.”Applications can be made online at the Council website –  http:www.orkney.gov.uk School-Benefit or by calling  for a paper application form.Further information is available on  https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S School-Meals-and-Clothing-Allowances.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Theyrsquove got a global perspective, and more importantly a North American perspective, and each shot is a bit of a bullseye.But he sounded a note of caution: ldquoTheir one million dollar moment is whether or not the hype about all these corporate deals theyrsquore doing with entertainment and tech giants will ultimately match the output.There are likely to be questions asked about the couplersquos deal as Spoty is among a group of audio streaming services being examined by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.There has been increased scrutiny of the business models of s such as Spoty, Apple Music, Amazon Music and Google Play after artist revenue from live performance was hit by Covid-.The Musiciansrsquo Union and the Ivors Academy have described streaming royalties as ldquowoefully insufficient.Netflix has been in the headlines over its popular series The Crown, after critics claimed it was not doing enough to ensure viewers know its depiction of the British monarchy is a work of fiction.Speaking about the new project, Meghan says in the trailer: ldquoThis is also a moment to celebrate kindness and compassion, something we saw in so many places this year, and which will underlie everything you hear from Archewell Audio.She said about their first podcast, due for release during the Christmas period: ldquoWersquore talking to some amazing people, theyrsquore going to share their memories that have really helped shape this past year which has been, as we know, a dficult one for everyone.Put.

This includes users of all ages and levels of mobility – cyclists, walkers, runners and wheelchair and mobility vehicle users.The route has been chosen to promote active travel, link communities, improve local access, and act as a springboard for an island-wide network of safe paths.The project group has lodged a planning application for the Skye Bridge to Ashaig Airstrip section of the route, following the old A road where possible. And they are now starting on a detailed consultation for a link between Ashaig and Broadford.In March the project group held a community consultation on the three possible routes for this section. It was concluded that the single track ‘committee road’ option running through Breakish would give the best compromise between a quiet, scenic, low-traffic area, and the straightest, most direct route. This was the link most favoured by public consultees. met with supporters of the project outside Breakish Hall to find out what the Skye Cycle Way would mean to them.Broadford Primary pupil Krista said a cycle path would allow her and other children to do what they loved without any worries.She said: “For little kids that want to do more cycling it would be safer because just a little slip off the pavement could lead to a road accidentthere’s a car coming, so I think the cycle path would be really handy.“It wouldn’t put me at risk of traffic and it would mean I just go out and cycle.”Breakish resident Lis Phillips felt the cycle way could help recapture the feeling of safety for cyclists experienced during the lockdown.She said: “I cycle back and forth to my work at Broadford surgery, and during the lockdown, I noticed people on bikes who I’ve never seen cycling before because there were hardly any cars on the roads.“There is obviously an appetite for people to be able to cycle but they don’t feel it is safe, so they don’t do it.”The project group has been working with engineering consultants and main funder Sustrans, to come up with a design proposal for the route that will meet their requirements.The plans involve separating cyclists from pedestrians and other users. Cyclists would share the single-track carriageway with motor traffic, and pedestrians would enjoy a new . metre wide footpath. that the safer environment would help pupils thrive.“There is no way to avoid traffic when you are living here in Broadford, it is so busy – all the traffic that comes through Skye comes through us. So for the children, it was quite daunting to let them out on their bikes through the village.“However, during the lockdown, they were out on bikes, and more of them were cycling than ever before. You are seeing fitter and healthy children with just that bit more independence and freedom.“The cycle way is a wonderful thing.”Kyleakin resident Ian Sikorski, who has a family house in the area, earmarked the best route between Ashaig and Broadford through the community consultation and said: “Hopefully people will see the necessity for it. We have the house at the end of the ‘committee road’ beside the cattle grid.“My auntie lived there, and at that time there weren’t many houses at all. Now look at the number, and in another  years there will probably be twice the number – and you have seen the state of the road, so it badly needs a footpath.“Highland Council should have put in a footpath really. It is definitely needed. If people with families are going to build houses then it would be greatthey are able to walk and cycle along to Broadford or Kyleakin.“I used to cycle up that main road, regularly. I haven#t cycled it for years now. It is too dangerous.”﻿‘Future users’ group to be launched to help shape design of cycle way﻿The Skye Cycle Way project group secured funding from Transport Scotland via Sustrans to develop the detailed design proposals for the whole route, secure access permissions, and planning consents, and work up its strategy for finding the estimated £. million required. Match funding will be needed as this accounts for  per cent of the overall project costs.This builds on earlier feasibility studies, concept designs, and community consultation undertaken during , also funded by Transport Scotland and Sustrans. that a ‘future users’ group will be launched in the new year to ensure that all sections of the community have the opportunity to help shape the design of the path.They added: “We want this to be a safe, shared-use path for everybody, an asset for our communities, our environment, and our economy.”Due to Covid restrictions, the group have been unable to hold any face-to-face public consultations since March but are hoping this changes in the new year..

He also thought that upgrading Portree harbour would be an ideal project.“This update is encouraging and is an exciting development for Skye and Raasay,” he added. “Over the last few years we have seen some great partnership working at ious tourist hot-spots that has attracted some investment which has made a signicant dference, but we acknowledge there is much to do, and major investment is still needed.“The local area committee and partners are ambitious for Skye and Raasay and this investment plan which spells out actions for coordinating and securing funding and for the implementation of the plan.”Calum Munro highlighted the redevelopment of Uig harbour as a possible candidate for inclusion.He added: “The development of the Skye and Raasay investment plan is at an important and exciting phase as over the next two months stakeholders gather to engage with all the potential projects which will be part of that plan. It will be great to look at projects and see which ones best achieve the outcomes we want to see for Skye and Raasay in terms of infrastructure, strengthening communities, health and education, developing a green and erse economy and sustainable tourism.“Looking at these projects and identying interconnectedness and partnership opportunities is crucial and it’s clear that to bring in the required investment there needs to be an approach which is strategic and cohesive.“We are now at the stage where virtually the whole of Skye and Raasay have formed community trusts so I’m really looking forward to seeing some of these communities building on the work they’ve already done and achieving some of their other ambitions over the next two-three years.”Calum MacLeod said: “I’d like to see a collaborative economic recovery plan continuing with all relevant stakeholders’ involvement that is essential to address the Covid impact, and also a continuing plan to address at pace more attainable affordable housing. “The plan would also be a great opportunity to improve sustainable green tourism including better public transport infrastructure and the Skye cycle path.“It is a necessity to see trunk road agencies working closer together in achieving better and safer measures for all road users and residents working with councillors. The good work and investment that has been established to date on improving ious key projects should continue going forward towards full development.”For John Finlayson, a place-based and joined up Skye plan is “long overdue” and it was essential that the public sector, businesses, community interests and the wider community “work together to support economic recovery and development taking account of the unique challenges and the unique opportunities” in the Eilean a’ Cheo ward.He added: “The key areas of focus in what has to be an outcome driven plan and which were included in the report to the area committee are strong starting points for further community discussion and engagement. But I doubt many willargue that strengthening communities, health and education, sustainable tourism, digital and transport infrastructure and a erse and green economy are not areas we need to focus on.“I personally have a strong commitment to ensuring the best for our young people. This of course means that we need to make sure that our children are educated in st century buildings which provide safe, healthy and modern learning environments and I will continue to champion the need to build new schools at Broadford and Dunvegan.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CROFTING-SHEEP-1.jpg","title":"the rams are out to mark the start of the crofting","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWith most now looking ahead to the year-end celebrations and festive reflections, the shortened daylight hours of late autumn and winter actually mark the start of the crofting year, certainly for those whose main interest is livestock, which is the vast majority.This is the time when the rams go out with the ewes, everything bar breeding stock has more or less been sold and it’s time to hunker down for the long winter ahead.Sheep have a natural production cycle which fits the seasonal patterns. As the days shorten, they naturally come on “season” ready for the ram, so that their lambs hit the ground with the new flush of spring grass. Mother Nature never ceases to amaze.Cows, on the other hand, can breed all-year, with the same gestation period as humans, though most calve in or around the spring, for much the same reason as sheep.But late autumn is when you start with a blank canvas. The next few weeks and months are all about ensuring everything has enough feed and reserves to carry it through the cold and wet – but especially the wet.I’ve heard many an old-timer say that the cold and wind rarely bother the animals. It’s the wet that really has an impact, as the lack of a dry lying area just saps their reserves.The financial s from a few animals are just too low to justy expenditure on large sheds and then there’s the cost of bedding. In conversation with a mainland farmer, I happened to remark that it cost us in Lewis north of £ for a big bale of bedding straw, sometimes £. He was getting it at £. He was in no doubt that at these prices it was completely unsustainable to have cattle inside for anyof time.If it’s a crisp, frosty winter, the cattle aren’t much of a problem. But the incessant rain can become a depressing drudge as you constantly battle the mud and dampness. With most crofters having a full-time job, you can see why so many just concentrate on keeping a few sheep – they don’t poach the ground nearly as much and, for quite obvious reasons, require much less feeding.For my own part, I’ve noticed a huge improvement in the grazing and ground since introducing cattle and they’re also vital for accessing environmental funding streams aimed at increasing bioersity.When the better weather finally does come, they’re much less selective in their grazing, meaning they will consume a lot of the harsher grasses, leading to greater rejuvenation of sward. Their dung is an extremely proficient fertiliser that attracts a myriad of insects which, in turn, brings more birdle – a very important consideration in today’s environmentally-conscious times.It’s all pros and cons and weighing up what’s right for your own personal circumstances, time and available infrastructure.But, whatever, it’s crucial to get the winter maintenance regime right so the animals can get off to the best of possible starts and, with a bit of luck, we can settle down to the festivities in a relatively rested frame of mind, however muted the celebrations might all be this year.WHILE we look back on what has been the most tumultuous of years, I hope we don’t forget the massive extra volunteer effort that was needed to carry us through. It was rather gratying to see the best of selfless human endeavour coming through in the worst of crises.At one stage it looked like there would be no livestock sales in the islands. In the greater scheme of things it would hardly have been the worst of outcomes, but it would nevertheless have created huge logistical problems. Fortunately, it did not materialise.The commercial aspect on sale day is overseen by Dingwall and Highland Marts, in the case of Stornoway, Portree and Lochmaddy, and United Auctions in Lochboisdale and the Argyll islands. But it still requires a huge amount of volunteer effort at local level. Even in normal times it is a thankless task to ensure all the animals are in their correct pens and the sale keeps moving along efficiently.Considering social distancing rules and that livestock owners were not allowed to be present on sale day, it must have been all the more challenging this year. So a huge debt of gratitude is owed to all those who ensured the sales went ahead – and relatively smoothly into the bargain. The fact that the prices were so good was a bit of an extra boost, just when we all needed it most."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Dining-Room-2-.jpg","title":"business spotlight priory hotel","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Priory Hotel is a three-star VisitScotland rated hotel in the picturesque village of Beauly, no more than a short drive north of Inverness and just off the North Coast  driving route.Ownership of Beauly’s Priory Hotel is in the hands of its employees.

Almost a decade, and many awards, later Meena says, “In the beginning, we used to recommend people use the salt in salads but then we started adding it to all our food. It’s great as it doesn’t dominate the taste but just melts into and improves the flavour of all types of dishes, and you only need to use a small amount.” Indeed, feedback from a repeat customer confirms this: “I love cooking with your salt and think about its purity and provenance every time.” Meena added, “These kind of comments bring joy to our hearts!”Fellow director, Chris Watts adds, “We have always looked at the business in a holistic way, with eco-credentials at the heart of the business, from production to the packaging design to the end product. We are very proud to be part of the Scottish Food and Drink Industry, which we know will continue to thrive.”Asked how Isle of Skye Sea Salt had been affected by the Covid- pandemic, Meena replied, “Like most businesses, we’ve had a challenging year. Initially, we had to adjust and focus on our producer partners and increasing online custom until our catering and retail customers were also able to re-open in the latter half of the season. The eco-credentials, provenance, texture and taste have all made a dference to repeat orders. Every order matters to us. We are keen to promote the Isle of Skye brand. We would like to say a really big thank you to all our supporters chefs, collaborators, online and local buyers. Our hearts go out to businesses that have put in as much effort as us but perhaps haven’t survived. Hearing about the vaccine, we feel there is light at the end of the tunnel. We really feel positive about the future and hope that with the support available many of them will be able to start again.”Recent collaborations with Graham’s Family Dairy on an Isle of Skye Sea Salt butter, Chocolates of Glenshiel and COCO Chocolatier Isle of Skye Sea Salt have every reason to feel positive about the future.

The big dference for those who have worked in the town over the past two weeks is the great smell of cookery in the air - that has been largely absent since the imposition of mini lockdown restrictions two weeks ago. By am the whf of Christmas dinners being cooked was wafting through the town as restaurants geared up for the lunchtime trade. Sadly, Council had to take the decision to cancel the Greenvale Street Christmas Market - and this may be a wise move in the context of what seems to be a rising trend in infections across the area.As usual the vast majority of people were following all the proper protocols with the numbers choosing to wear face masks on street markedly on the rise.Bear in mind it’s only .am and we can expect numbers of shoppers to rise steadily throughout the day. And that is why the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging shoppers to keep safe whilst out shopping this weekend.Councillor Peter Johnston said: “As we move closer to Christmas, our energy is focused on reminding people to stay safe whilst doing all that they can to support local businesses in these challenging times.“This has been a dficult year for everyone, not least those who have been striving to run a business, as they continue to provide services and keep people in jobs during this pandemic.“Business owners and retailers in Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Larne have worked hard in putting the necessary measures in place to help keep staff and customers safe. So when out and about, it’s important that everyone follows the public health advice: wash or sanitise hands often, wear a face covering and practise social distancing.“We all have an important role to play in helping to stop the spread of Covid.“We have a fantastic retail offering across Mid and East Antrim, and I encourage everyone to safely #Rediscover the #SpiritofMEA by supporting local this Christmas.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3527333.jpg--.jpg?1607676331000\n","title":"your world around your wrist with local woman erinn s ivy and gold bracelets","story":"LOCAL woman Erinn Kerr has been helping mums, friends and family wear their world around their wrist as her personalised Ivy and Gold bracelet brand has recently soared to success.Erinn lives just outside Broughshane with her husband and little girl, Ivy.Her daughter Ivy was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was just two weeks old, after a newborn screening heel prick test was performed. The condition is inherited, with both parents being carriers of a particular gene. Symptoms include the build up of sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive systems of people with Cystic Fibrosis over time. Erinn explained: There is no cure. “However, there has been lots of great news about new medications that will be available to Ivy when shes older which will be le changing for her.The success of her bracelets has led to Erinn stepping away from her media job at the BBC and devoting her time to building up her business, Ivy and Gold Bracelets, as well as caring for Ivy.Erinn also recently donated a portion of her sales to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.SUPPORTA firm bloggers favourite, Erinns bracelets have become a real Instagram hit with her creations gracing the wrists of high profile influencers such as Naomi Genes, and Ballymena based Blossoming Birds, Anna Corry.Erinn has been overwhelmed by the growing success of her bracelets and told the : I cant believe how popular they have been. Im blown away by the support I have received and by how much everyone loves the bracelets.Its a really big deal for me to see these influencers wear my products. “I guessthese people, who I consider to be really cool think these bracelets are worthy of wearing then that makes me really excited about the future.Lots of lovely local influencers have been so supportive of me and my business too. “People like Anna from Blossoming Birds, Elle Pearls and Gluten Free Fi. “Help from people like that is huge to a small business.FORMATIONErinn made her first bracelet on a whim, after seeing similar products online from a few dferent sellers in America.Apprehensive about postage and import fee costs, Erinn went in search of a maker based in Europe.However, that search proved futile and Erinn decided to try to make some of her own.Erinn said: I honestly dont know why. Ive never made proper jewellery before.I made one for myself saying IVY and then when I wore it people started asking could I make them one with their kids names on it. It just went from there.Its not dficult to see why Erinns bracelets have become so successful. Blending contemporary designs with traditional gold and silver, her now signature personalised name bracelets have proved to be most popular.From modern stacking bracelets, in gold filled and sterling silver beads, to personalised designs for both adults and children, her bracelets are quickly becoming the perfect gts for family and friends.Erinn is grateful for each and every order she receives and is particularly thankful to those who have helped her along the way.Erinn commented: My husband has helped me endlessly. He made my website and logo and has been so supportive when things have been stressful, even writing envelopes at times. “Though I havent got him actually making bracelets yet.Anna from Blossoming Birds has also been a huge supporter. She helped me get some beautul imagery to help me get started and has given me loads of great advice.Im so grateful to everyone who has ordered a bracelet from me.CHANGES has been quite a year for Erinn becoming a new mother, grappling with a worldwide pandemic as well as standing down from her busy job at the BBC.Erinn said: Its hard for me to compare le at the BBC with le as the owner of a small business because so much has changed all at once. I became a mum for the first time just a few months before the pandemic really hit and at the same time I started this business. So, le before Ivy, Ivy and Gold and the pandemic all go hand in hand and to be honest its like a totally dferent world.I can barely imagine leaving Ivy to drive up to Belfast every day after months spent locked down and not even allowed to go to the shop because of shielding for her condition.I loved my job at the BBC, but after Ivys diagnosis, coupled with the pandemic and shielding, my priority was staying home with her, doing all of her treatments and keeping my family safe.Ivy and Gold has allowed me to do that and Im so grateful.Christmas sales have been crazy, so much so, that I closed the website to new orders on November .I will be working right up to December , the last posting day with Royal Mail, to get all the orders out.You can view Erinns bracelets at Ivy and Gold Bracelets on Instagram and facebook, or by visiting her website www.ivygoldGt cards only are available now for Christmas.

Shed  will be used to inspect animal products travelling from Britain after BrexitMichael McHughDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland will be an attractive location for US firms seeking access to EU and UK markets after Brexit, the First Minister has said. Businesses will have unfettered access to Britain and frictionless trade with the Republic and the rest of the EU next year. That created opportunities and benefits, DUP leader Arlene Foster said. She added: If businesses are from America and looking for access to the UK single market and access to the EU single market, then Northern Ireland seems to be a very good place. Several US and multinational fintech firms already have major bases here. Politicians and business promotion bodies have concentrated much effort on attracting inward investment from the US. From January Northern Ireland will remain in the UK customs territory but will be able to trade freely across the border with the Irish Republic and the rest of the EU. Under the terms of the protocol, the region has to apply EU customs rules at its ports. That means tarfs would be collected on goods moving from Britainthey were due for onward transportation to the Republic. Work was under way yesterday in Larne to construct a temporary border control post.The DUP opposed the protocol but Mrs Foster said Prime Minister Boris Johnson#s -seat majority meant her MPs could not thwart the agreement. She told the Assembly: This First Minister will not be found wanting when there is work to do to try and mitigate against the worst excesses of the EU and the protocol. She noted businesses here wanted secure post-Brexit access to their main market of Britain. Of course we will take any benefits that flow from the protocol , she said. It has been a very dficult period for us all in relation to this. The UK and Canada have agreed a deal to continue trading under the same terms as the current EU agreement after the Brexit transition period ends. Britain and Japan have also signed a commerce agreement where nearly all exports to Japan will be tarf-free and British levies on Japanese cars will be removed by . Mrs Foster said: It is important to look at access to UK trade deals. Those deals are beginning to become a reality. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Conor Murphy yesterday criticised a lack of information from the UK Government around Brexit, saying it is very dficult to plan for the end of the transition period just weeks away.We have a weekly meeting in relation to Brexit and it is always characterised by a lack of information and a lack of certainty, he told media during a visit to Dunmurry.The sooner we have some certainty in relation to Brexit the better. There is not going to be a good outcome to Brexit, it#s just the least-worst option that we are trying to get to.The Government said last week an extra £m would go to Northern Ireland to address the effects of Brexit on trade, but Mr Murphy said he had not yet received any detail on the funding. It was announced in the House of Commons and we were told the NIO was going to follow up with further announcements, so we haven#t got the detail as yet, he said.

Yes you may be able to hit the shops, get a haircut and catch up with friends for coffee again after two weeks of closure but there#s a definite air of enjoy it while you can as the threat of ato lockdown looms large.Health officials have warned that further Covid- restrictions will be needed before the end of the month due to Northern Ireland#s climbing infection rates and the predicted January spike.On the streets of Belfast city centre on Monday afternoon, many Christmas shoppers were also facing facts and accepting that their current festive freedoms will be short-lived.From December  to  people from three households are allowed to meet indoors to facilitate family gatherings and many are facing a tough choice when it comes to who will celebrate in their Christmas bubbles.Taking a break for a spot of lunch outside the City Hall with her mum and baby son, Nicola Stevenson from Bangor was among those relieved to have her festive bubble all sewn up.It will myself, my husband, the baby, my parents and my sister which is usually the norm for us at Christmas, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNicola Stevenson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNicola Stevenson We would usually have gone to a few Christmas events together. For this year we are happy enough to stay in as a family as we#re a small unit and can all fit in the same house.We#ve got this far sothere#s another lockdown in January then we would get through it.The way I see it it#s a choice of staying at home or risk catching the virus, Nicola added.Also keeping things low profile this year are husband and we Peter and Bernie Farrell from Claudy, who were in Belfast overnight for a spot of final Christmas shopping.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter and Bernie Farrell FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter and Bernie Farrell Christmas will look fairly normal for us because as a family we all live beside each other in the country with no one  really near us, said Bernie.We#ve all been isolating in our own bubble anyway and we#re mentally prepared for another lockdown straight after Christmas because we all know it#s coming, added Peter.For mother and daughter, Collette Grogan and Maureen McIlkenny from north Belfast, their Christmas is looking better than they had initially expected.We thought that mummy and daddy, who is ill, would be on their own as they#re shielding but we#re able to all be together now, said Maureen.But I don#t agree with the five days for families getting together when Christmas is only one day. One day would have been enough.Elsewhere construction worker Adam Larkin from Carryduff is more worried about the potential for a full-blown lockdown in January than who will be around his Christmas table.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAdam Larkin FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAdam Larkin This Christmas I#m just mixing with very close family and we haven#t been out anywhere for months except to work, he said.His co-worker Peter Lavery from Newtownbreda added: We still don#t know who we#ll be able to see over the few days in terms of family because every plan we#ve organised so far can#t happen within the rules.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Lavery FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Lavery We had booked to go to a Donegal hotel for a few days after Christmas but we#ve cancelled that too.

The total spend hit £.m - up from £m.Beer and lager sales had the strongest percentage increase of the three types of booze tracked by the information company.Figures shared with this newspaper show wine sales grew by nearly a fth to £.m in the  weeks. But cider fell out of favour for those drinking at home, with sales down nearly % to £.m. The period included six weeks of lockdown for restaurants and bars serving food, aimed at containing the spread of Covid-.Bars serving drink only were open for just three weeks within the period. At the moment, bars can only open where they serve food from a kitchen on the premises.Kantar monitors sales in supermarkets like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury#s and Lidl, as well as convenience stores like Spar, Centra and Mace, and off-licences. But it does not track sales of spirits.Retail analyst Emer Healy from Kantar said that as well as buying alcohol to compensate for closures, customers may have been stocking up for Christmas. Colin Neill, chief executive of pub trade body Hospitality Ulster, said it was no surprise the closure of bars was driving up sales of alcohol. But he said it also meant an increase in social mixing and a less controlled environment for drinking, where the risk of Covid- transmission was potentially greater. While we#re closed, we#re not only driving up alcohol sales but house parties too, he said.That#s going to increase over Christmas, but hospitality will end up paying the price by being locked down. Our traditional pubs have only been opened for three weeks since St Patrick#s Day... I appreciate while we#re closed, people will obviously want a beer or a gin and turn to the off-sales market for that. It#s not us complaining about customers and their behaviour, but it#s depressing in that our pubs have spent so much and put measures in place and have not been allowed to be open. He said some pubs permitted to open under the current lockdown were weighing up whether to stay open and lose money, or stay closed and lose money. We need to have adequte compensation from the government wherenot in a position to be open, he said.Belfast Most ReadBarbara Windsor said Man United legend George Best was a hit between sheets during one-night standSarah CreightonOpinionNorthern Ireland centenary launch felt like it was streamed from a sideways universe, I aged  yearsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new cases#Killjoy# cops stop Belfast Santa sleigh tour over safety concerns and lightsAmanda finds solace in NI Hospice#s special service following husband Paul Crawford#s deathLatest CoronavirusWeir criticised for not cancelling A-Level and GCSE exams next summerCoronavirus: Northern Ireland #not where it needs to be# after two week circuit-breaker, warns chief medicDUP Minister Edwin Poots tests positive for Covid-Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new casesNorthern Ireland Children to Lapland and Days to Remember Trust bringing magic to very special childrenLatest from Belfast Billie Eilish documentary offers glimpse inside the world of a pop sensationClash of heads affected me for nine months, says Jan VertonghenPedro Neto claims late winner as Wolves edge victory over ChaMan dies in Co Leitrim crashHarry and Meghan highlight ‘dferent perspectives and voices’ with Spoty deal,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No questions were allowed after the personal statement, which he made from .pm.“We need to be able to talk about the past, in a way that doesn#t cause the ision or deepen ision,” Mr Stanley said.Read MoreKim Bielenberg:OpinionAnglo-Irish relations might be strained but we’ve overcome worseSenan Molony:OpinionWhy Sinn Fein could well have dodged a bullet at the last election“I accept that my tweet regarding the ambushes at Kilmichael and Narrow Water was insensitive, and it caused hurt and anger. Words can do that. And my words did and for that I am truly sorry.”Having thus dismissed his post about the killing of  members of the British Army outside Warrenpoint in August , Mr Stanley moved on to another tweet he posted in  on the day that Leo Varadkar was elected as leader of Fine Gael.“The impending election as Taoiseach of someone who is gay was rightly highlighted, at the time, as a sign of the progress that we have made as a country, and as a State, and followed on from the marriage equality referendum two years prior. “That#s something that people are very proud of, and rightly so. The point that I was trying to make was that it#s great, but let#s also focus on advancing workers rights, and the rights of people on low income and economic justice and issues such as a living wage, which we don#t have yet in this country.He accepted however that he did not articulate this “in a very good way,” and that his tweet “is open to dferent interpretations.”He added: “I did try to contact the Tanaiste today to express my apology personally to him, and it will do so again. Homophobia is abhorrent to me, and I absolutely deplore prejudice, of any kind, and all of us have realised that many people who have read my tweets don#t know me personally. They don#t know my record.“This is is not a defence, nor does it take away from any hurt caused. It only provides an insight into the values that I hold as an activist, and as a political representative, and more importantly, as a person.“As an ally of the LGBT community, I’m even more responsible and more accountable, and I recognised that. I hope that those who have been hurt accept my apologies, and my colleagues here except the sincerity of a statement.“I own my own mistakes.”Meanwhile Tipperary Sinn Fein TD Martin Browne, also mired in controversy over a social media comment, is ill at home, his party has confirmed.The Oireachtas Petitions Committee, which Mr Browne chairs, will not now meet this week as a result, having failed to go into session last week because of a row over remarks on Facebook.Mr Browne distributed   conspiracy theories on Facebook, along with lurid posts relating to the Pentagon, Nazis and Isis. He told Tipp FM, in an interview after the Stanley furore, that Sinn Fein should “stop apologising” for its core beliefs, including that there has been a continuous war against the British occupation of Ireland.Fine Gael has withdrawn a request that the Petitions committee meet this week on the issue of Mr Browne’s opinions after learning that he is indisposed.A Sinn Fein spokesman told the Irish Independent: “Martin is ill.

hauliers.With just weeks to go until the end of the Transition period and negotiations between the UK and EU ongoing, Ms Mallon told MLAs she has concerns over the potential impact to hauliers.“I am sensitive to the fact that discussions between negotiating teams are ongoing and the outcome will be determined by the British Government and the EU,” she said.“Any outcome that places a limit on the number of hauliers permitted to travel south to transport and receive goods such as the need for an ECMT permit will have the potential for serious supply chain disruption and detrimental economic

the Irish government is part-funding.Ms Mallon said her officials have “obtained detailed legal advice” which she will consider that advice before deciding on future steps.“I can assure the member I

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir revealed measures which he believes will ensure fair and flexible public examinations in  on Tuesday. Mark BainTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s A-Level students will sit fewer exams in  after new measures were announced by the Education Minster.But Peter Weir is facing renewed criticism for failing to act decisively and cancel A-Level and GCSE exams for next summer.The Minister revealed measures which he believes will ensure fair and flexible public examinations in  on Tuesday.But he again ruled out any idea that next summer’s examinations will be cancelled, saying they would be “underpinned by contingencies for all scenarios”.Mr Weir told the Assembly that students would have the opportunity to omit up to % of their AS or A-level assessments, meaning for a “signicant” number of subjects, this would mean taking only one exam.Mr Weir added: “We will ensure that their lives are not defined or held back by the disruption they have experienced in .“The summer of  has shown us that public exams remain the best way for students to show what they can do.”But SDLP Education spokesperson, Daniel McCrossan MLA said the Minster is continuing to fail students.“It is nothing short of scandalous that the Minister is continuing to fail students by refusing to cancel GSCE and A-Level exams,” he said.“Other jurisdictions have acted decisively to support young people, but Minister Weir has dogmatically refused to do so. It is a disgrace.”Alliance Education spokesperson Chris Lyttle said more should have been expected.“The Education Minister’s inaction, indecision and U-turns have caused chaos for pupils this year,” said Mr Lyttle.“We are therefore entitled to expect more than a statement to the Assembly which is vague at best in its detail and commitments. Other jurisdictions have taken decisive action to cancel or signicantly mody exams due to the unprecedented disruption we have seen to learning.“On the week commencing October , around , pupils were not in school. Currently, some pupils are on their fourth period of self-isolation, with many staff affected as well. What level of disruption to pupils is the Minister willing to accept before introducing moderated centre school assessment instead of GCSE, AS-Level and A-Level exams in  ”Robbie Butler MLA gave the announcement a belated but cautious welcome.“Sadly, lost classroom time will continue to be a burden for many students, he said. I remain concerned that these pupils have not received detail today as to what mitigations will look like. The minister must as a matter of urgency address the issue of providing certainty for students who have lost considerable classroom teaching.“Another point of concern is that according to departmental guidance, all content must be covered by all students, so precious time will be spent on units that pupils may choose not to enter. As choice is so important, why then is it that pupils who do not wish to take assessments in certain units have no choice but to cover the content because other pupils wish to  This promotes unfairness once again.”Koulla Yiasouma, Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People said some clarity has been provided.“The measures have gone quite a long way to alleviate the workload. I believe we are in a better place than we were,” she said.“I do however reserve judgement on whether the measures go far enough. I am meeting with young people later this week to discuss and hear their views, before making a more detailed and more informed response.”Teacher’s Union the NASUWT said key questions remain unanswered.“The measures announced today do not go far enough,” said Justin McCamphill, NASUWT National Official for Northern Ireland.“It is vital that the Minister sets out further detail on how the contingency plans for students unable to sit examinations will work in practice.Patrick Roach, General Secretary of the NASUWT, added: “While addressing some of the uncertainty that has surrounded what will happen with qualications next summer, today’s announcement leaves key questions unanswered.“The Minister’s delay in bringing forward plans for next summer’s examinations and qualications has caused unnecessary anxiety, stress and workload pressures for both teachers and pupils.“It is important that every possible step is taken to ensure that awards are fair to all students who have been impacted by the pandemic. However, the measures announced today do not go far enough.“It is now important that CCEA engages fully and urgently with the sector over the detailed arrangements for standard setting.Belfast Most ReadBarbara Windsor said Man United legend George Best was a hit between sheets during one-night standSarah CreightonOpinionNorthern Ireland centenary launch felt like it was streamed from a sideways universe, I aged  yearsCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann to propose further restrictions as six deaths and  new cases#Killjoy# cops stop Belfast Santa sleigh tour over safety concerns and lightsAmanda finds solace in NI Hospice#s special service following husband Paul Crawford#s deathLatest Northern IrelandSignature links #ex-loyalist leader# Winston Rea to Boston tapes, court toldSerious logistical disruption ‘cannot be avoided even with Brexit trade deal’Chaotic scenes outside Antrim Hospital as patients treated in ambulances in car parkPositive Covid test was ‘only a distraction’ before appendix surgery – Edwin PootsLatest from Belfast Towie stars Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet share baby newsCha already feeling festive fatigue following Wolves defeat – Frank LampardTwo London councils back down over school closuresBillie Eilish documentary offers glimpse inside the world of a pop sensationClash of heads affected me for nine months, says Jan Vertonghen,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

So Ill be in the kitchen prepping on Christmas Eve and then the dinner will be cooked and delivered on Christmas Day for anyone who’s alone or in need of one.Last year we actually had some spare meals left over so I went and delivered them up to the Fire Station, which was the highlight of my Christmas, she said.Paula has been provided with the names of people in the local community who would benefit from the scheme by the Operation Snowball at the OLT and staff at the Long Tower Youth Club.This service is free of charge of course, soyou or someone you know needs help this Christmas please send me a message to the Peggys Kitchen Facebook page,continued Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push Last year we covered the cost of it ourselves, apart from the desserts, but this year Foyle Fruit have kindly offered to donate the potatoes and vegetables and we have also had donations of containers and cups. All donations are welcome andanyone wishes to help our efforts that help would be much appreciated.Ms Monk has enlisted the help of two delivery drivers to take the food to the Bogside, Brandywell and Creggan areas of the city.Like all cafes, Peggys Kitchen is closed at the moment due to current restrictions.Its sad that we cant open because we really miss our customers like the Over s Club that used to meet here every Wednesday and for a lot of them it was their only source of interaction but the safety of everyone needs to come first, said Ms Monk. googletag.cmd.push We cant wait to reopen again but until then please keep safe.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ballinascreens Aine McAllister played both camogie and football for Derry this season. She tells Michael McMullan about her love and passion for playing both codes. *** With a day of teaching in Eglintons Broadbridge Primary School done and dusted, Aine McAllisters mind is still racing. Her voice remains charged with energy. A passion for sport hugs every dancing word. Its much like her all-action playing career. She empties the tank every time she pulls on the jersey. The colour is irrelevant. Red or maroon. It doesnt matter. Since the early U days with Ballinascreen, football and camogie have been a constant. Her parents Mickey and Maria supported every move and ferried their sons and daughters around the corners of Derry. googletag.cmd.push Now , nothing has changed for Aine in her eighth season on the Derry senior squad. In the months after Derrys  All-Ireland intermediate title, the county held their annual presentation. As part of the minor squad, Aine was there in the Wild Duck that night to bring down the curtain on the season. It was then senior manager John A Mullan who asked her about stepping up to senior level. The following year, aged , she joined the squad under Joe Baldwin and vividly remembers her first training session. Slamming sliotars against the wall of Magherafelts Meadowbank complex, they honed their striking action, reflexes and handling. A whos who of McAllisters idols. googletag.cmd.push She always dreamt of playing for Derry and here she was rubbing shoulders with the likes of Katie McAuley, Grainne and Meabh McGoldrick. It was far from daunting. Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside was there too, a fourth year at St Marys Belfast when McAllister came in as a Fresher. They played on the team that reached the Fr Maher Final, a competition Aine would win with The Ranch in her final year. “That helped break the ice and I knew the faces from Ballinascreen. Bronagh McGillian wouldve been involved that year,” McAllister remembers of that first training session. “They were great,” she said of how the younger players were treated. “Katie McAuley wouldve scared the bejesus out of me for club camogie, but they were all very welcoming. They wanted girls no matter what club you were from, which was great.”     Of Derrys  Ulster championships, Aine has four winners medals and scored two points in the  decider at Swatragh, during current manager Ciaran Cunninghams last stint in the Oakleaf hotseat. In football, she reluctantly joined the county squad in recent seasons. It wasnt that she didnt want play football. “I wouldnt have wanted to have came in at that point, not having trained all year,” Aine said of Paul Croziers invite to come on board. “It wasnt possible, training on the same nights and there was a lot on top of each other. I didnt want to be at camogie and not fully committed to camogie...it was the same for football.” An all or nothing person, with half measures not sitting well. Crozier and some of the football squad, who were soon on the phone, assured Aine she was welcome. “They knew I was flat out trainingand not lying at home doing nothing,” she points out. Aine did join the  and this year the schedule had a dferent pattern. With Covid- forcing a split season format, her involvement with Ballinascreen was complete by the time the county scene rolled around and Aine was able to throw her lot into both camps. “We always played both,” she said of her career. “Butyoud asked me when I was younger, Id have said camogie was my first sport. As Ive grown up, they have just gone alongside each other.” There was always ladies football in Ballinascreen, so it just went hand and hand , demanding constant communication between the camps. Already, camogie manager Reamann Tam Kennedy and his football counterpart Conor McGarvey have touched base. With the experiences of last year consigned to history, they have picked through the rubble to plot a better path to take. “Tam was on the phone the day after the Slaughtneil game,” she reveals. “Telling me how we were going to improve for next year...he never switches off.” Growing up, it was a constant wrestle between Screen and Swatragh for honours. Aine, with the benefit of a good birthday, availed of a fruitful extra year, with U, U and minor glory coming her way. “In my school year, Swatragh were always a step ahead of us,” Aine remembers. “I was lucky enough to be part of the when we won the  All-Ireland Feacuteile in Kilkenny. Two years later we got down to Galway, but we didnt win it.” At St Marys Magherafelt, her teams were in the shadows of Cross and Passion, Ballycastle and rivals St Patricks Maghera. She decided to repeat her Upper Sixth year to get the grades for her teaching degree. “I refused to leave,” she can now joke. She needed a medal before calling time on her Convent days and they stopped the Maghera dominance to land the  title. “Out of all the medals, thats one of the best ones because of the long slog of school camogie and to finally get over the line was just great,” beams McAllister, placing much of the credit at her coach Reamann Kennedys door. “He did tactics and St Pats didnt have a clue what was going on and by the time they did, we were in the lead and it worked to our advantage.” *** What a dference a year makes in sport  Twelve months after watching Steelstown celebrate the  ladies title through their own tears of devastation, it was Ballinascreens turn to shine. The years of playing both codes would eventually pay idends. Again it was Steelstown in the final, but it took every sinew to pull Screen into dreamland. Louise Murphy grabbed two goals, with Casey McKenna bagging a third in a - to - win. They still needed goalkeeping heroics of Kathryn Conneryin a player of the final performance. It sparked pandemonium in the celebrations, as history was made with a first title. Lauren McKennas movement for Connerys kick-outs was another factor. So too was Aine McAllisters input at midfield, it a team that included her sisters Rachel and Sarah. Ballinascreen celebrate winning the  senior ladies championship, a first in their history  They retained their title last season, with victory over Ballymaguigan in a Sunday night monsoon at Owenbeg. It was Aines second game of the weekend, having played with Derry camogs  hours earlier. Having the football moved allowed her to play for both teams. Last month, she did the same – playing for Derry camogs and footballers in the same weekend. The refreshing thing was how much energy she was able to expend going down the final stretch of the second game. For McAllister, the split season had a huge impact on not only her own availability, but the rest of the county players. In the case of camogie, Ciaran Cunningham was able to boast a more competitive squad. “We didnt have the pressure of club football and camogie.” Aine states. The county titles were long dished out. “County is great and I really enjoy it, but I am sure there are people who say their club comes first. The one thing that sometimes bothered me, was that when you were playing county you were missing out on club training sessions, which was always the way it was going to be.” McAllister and Megan Kerr are Derry camogs representative on the WGPA. They recently circulated a survey to the rest of the , one that will be collated across all  counties in both bodes. Figuring prominently was the questions over keeping the split season. Speaking with both passion and reason in equal measure, Aine feels keeping the club and county seasons apart is the way forward. Everyone is a winner. “There are occasions that girls have turned down playing for Derry camogie, because they have a lot of pressure on from their club management, not wanting them to miss club training,” Aine points out. “Some girls are put into the situation where they cant win. Its not fair,you are playing for a club you should have the opportunity to represent Derry. “Its a pitygirls are not coming outit a case of support from clubs not being there...they would make a dference to Derry.” The split season or not, McAllisters schedule remained a busy one, training virtually every night of the week with at least one game at the weekend. It is something she accepts, butthere is a bit of give and take between both management teams, it can work. “It is about good communication between managers, and players being honest and taking the rest, they need to have their own responsibility for their own performance,” she adds. One group of people she feels need all the credit in the world are the fixture committees. “I dont know how they manage it,” she said. “When it comes to the championship, they do the best they can, but there is a big overlap with ladies football and camogie, Im sure it is the same for hurling and football. “I know Teresa McKenna has done so much for Derry football, with some of the fixtures that have been clashing.” But, in the long run, Aine feels the club championship season needs to be looked at. Ballinascreens entire football team are dual players. It prevents them from perfecting any last-minute preparation. A challenge game to work on tactics, or a few nights off to keep the limbs fresh. Aine in football action for Derry  “You have to give them credit in Slaughtneil for how well their camogie team have dominated not only Derry camogie, but across Ireland. “I can imagine their preparations and being down southand all the stuff Id love to do, but being dual it just doesnt work. It is not possible and girls have been burned out and that has been the case for some of the girls by the championship and they look more unfit.” That said, she wouldnt change being a dual player for the world, with the more positives than negatives. *** After their defeat to Meath in the All-Ireland series, Ciaran Cunningham praised the efforts of his team. Aine McAllister has a similar train of thought, having held all the aces for much of the first half. In recent seasons, Derry have more than held their own with Tipperary, Kilkenny and Cork, backing it up with four Ulster titles since . Former manager John ODwyer said the same. On their day, Derry can beat anybody. “If you are to go, player by player, when we come up against Down - I wouldnt swap anyone,” Aine admits. “Its like Slaughtneil camogs, they have learned how to work together as a unit. That is something we are missing. “Its not that girls wont pass to anyone, thats not it. I think we are just missing that link up, thats the dference between us and the so called stronger teams.” Down have had the core of their team playing together four or five years and they know each other inside out. Clonduff had been another shining light at club level. “But they really do live and breath for county camogie,” Aine adds.” “In Derry camogie, we have missing girls who are not out representing their county. It is as simple as that, some girls dont have the same interest as others. Its a pity, as the talent is there. Slaughtneil wouldnt have got as far as they have without their obvious talent.” The gap is closing in the Derry scene. Swatragh won the league in recent times and took the Emmets to a replay this year. Lavey pushed Swatragh all the way. And Ballinascreen, like Swatragh, have threatened to topple Slaughtneil. When it comes to the Derry squad, the same drive just hasnt been there. “We have struggled for numbers in Derry camogie and that shouldnt be the case...there is the pick of four or five girls in each club,” Aine stresses. There are the excuses of not committing due to club, but it doesnt wash with Aine. If the fixtures fit, it can work. “You can manage it,you want to play,” she added. The  season has proved it. “At the start of the year, I was the only Screen girl representing Derry in camogie, which is ridiculous when you see how close we are in the championship. “They all came out and these are girls were starting on the team...they realised how much they can get out of Derry camogie and how much they enjoyed it. “Then there are is Swatragh, Lavey and Slaughtneil,you look at Ceacuteat McEldowney, she such an asset to Derry camogie.” What she wouldnt do for having the full  to pick from, chomping at the bit to push for a start. ”Its a pity, its the only word I can say,” Aine continues. “When I was growing up all I wanted to do was to play for the Derry camogie team and better myself. I dont think there is any other way than going to the county, you are playing against better opposition and with better girls around you.” She longs for the day, when there are enough girls putting themselves forward that it requires trials. With players pushing to even make the . “If everybody would buy in, the damage wed do in intermediate camogie, never mind senior. When I started we competed at senior level. “Losing Katie, the McGoldricks, Aileen McCusker, who are massive misses but there are young girls out there who should be making up for some of the players, but are not coming on board, but hopefully that changes.” One thing wont change, Aine McAllisters love for sport. She knows nothing .  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He was an avid supporter of Derry and St Colm’s and an ever present at games in Owenbeg, Celtic Park and all over Ireland. “On behalf of Derry Management Committee, I would like to extend my sympathy to the McWilliams family and to the friends and relatives of other families who have lost loved ones in the past year.” googletag.cmd.push ALSO READ - How the motions fared at Derrys AGM.

He thanked the unrelenting work of so many people over the years. “The focus for future investment has to concentrate on people,” Barker promised, now that all the infrastructure is in place. “We must now ensure that our clubs, our championships and our county teams are comparable with the best in the country as well.” Barker said that it would only by helping clubs improve themselves that the county would prosper. He said the recent five-year coaching plan would be the framework for this to happen.     “I’d like to thank Damian Cassidy and his team for the work they put into what is a very comprehensive and ambitious plan but one I believe can reap rewardsthere is buy-in from the clubs. “The plan puts the focus on people and that’s where our investment must be going forward, in our people through schemes like the GPO scheme.” In his address, Barker also spoke on the Covid- pandemic that made  a dficult year for everyone in sport and beyond. “Everyone in society is indebted to the crucial work of the NHS and carers who have been heroes throughout this pandemic,” he said. “ The GAA too has played it part, both nationally and locally with clubs provided a vital source of contact for rural communities and those isolated because of lockdown. “Many clubs have delivered groceries and medicines to the elderly or isolating and opened their grounds for local communities to enjoy safe walking areas showing once again, the critical role many clubs play in their own community, Barker stated On the night, there were no contested positions for place on the County Management Committee.

The meeting, facilitated by club joining via video conference, lasted just over  minutes and saw Chairman Stephen Barker - and virtually the entire county board - elected for a second term. Only Glens Una Ferguson was forced to step down after five years as cultural officer, with Glenullins Niall Comer elected to take over. Glack brought forward a motion to amend rule .d in the associations Official Guide googletag.cmd.push GAA Official Guide .:When a player first legally participates in club competition with a clubat U or overorganised by the County committee or one of its sub committees, that club becomes his her first club We seek to amend . to read that when a player first registers with a club, this is his her first club irrespective of age or participating in club competition, read Glacks motion. Speaking on the motion, Glack said they were suffering from losing players to clubs perceived to be stronger and playing at a higher level, something Ardmore agreed with. googletag.cmd.push It was passed and will be taken forward by Derry GAA. A motion from Ballinderry, asked the CCC to consider using the same structures from the  season next year, with the championships now played on a knock-out format. - That the club championships are structured using the same format as that used in .- PASSED Dungiven spoke on behalf of a motion to have another team from the club play in the junior league, on top of their current senior and reserves teams.      - That  CCC review the league entries and allow clubs with thirds teams the option to enter their junior team into the junior league.  Slaughtneil brought forward a motion that will look at the playing landscape above U, under the new age grades. Stephen Barker pointed to the countys proposal to play U. and U level competition, while saying that Derry need to consult with Antrim on the matter, given the clubs playing hurling in the Antrim league. - That Coiste Dhoire organise meaningful U club leagues and championships in football and hurling, similar to current minor schedule, to bridge the gap from U to senior grade and to provide appropriate games and development opportunities for players emerging from U.  Newbridge have proposed that club reserve teams no longer play their championship games on a Monday night of a championship weekend. The motion has been passed to the  CCC. - That Senior Intermediate Reserve championship knock-out games are played, ideally, on the following Friday after Senior knock out games rather than the Monday as is the current situation, anda Friday clashes with hurling championship the game is played on the Wednesday.  AGE GROUP CHANGES The following motions, asking for underage groups not to change to U, U and U could not be considered, as they were not written correctly to be put to the GAAs Central Council. Glenullin highlighted that very few clubs were in favour of the new age grades and asked Derry GAAa motion could be written on behalf of clubs going forward. Derry Chairman Stephen Barker said that the new age group motion came under the power of Central Council and couldnt be changed. The motions, sent by clubs, are listed as were as follows:- That Choiste Chontae Dhoire’s underage football and hurling competitions remain at U, U, U and U in  to prevent the loss of young players faced with transitioning from a decimated U season in  straight to Senior in   - The County Board reverse their decision on underage year groups and keep U, U and U.

Members of the ‘Into The West’ group met with Eamon Ryan, who is also the leader of the Green Party in the Republic, on Friday. Among the topics discussed were a proposed new rail service from Derry to Letterkenny and a new direct rail line from Derry to Dublin. Into The West was founded in  to campaign against a Stormont decision to close the Derry-Belfast railway line west of Coleraine. Since then the group has also successfully fought for an hourly service between Derry and Belfast, as well as the new station at the Waterside. googletag.cmd.push Into The West co-chair, Steve Bradley, said they were grateful for Minister Ryan for meeting with them. “Our region is the forgotten corner of the island when it comes to infrastructure, and Donegal and Tyrone have been left without rail for decades,” said Mr Bradley. “Whilst there is still much to do before any firm commitments could be given, the Minister reacted positively to the case for a new commuter rail route from Derry to Letterkenny, and also to the possibility of a direct route to Dublin from Derry and Letterkenny. “Such a service would run via Strabane and Omagh, so would really help bind the north-west city region together physically. googletag.cmd.push “We also discussed our longer-term ambition of extending rail from Letterkenny all the way through Donegal to Sligo, to connect with the proposed new ‘Western Rail Corridor’. “That project seeks to create a direct rail link between Cork, Limerick, Galway and Sligo. By adding Letterkenny and Derry to that corridor you would not only connect every main town in the western half of the island by rail – you would also create a necklace of rail linking all the key population centres in Ireland: from Dublin north to Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, Lisburn and Belfast west to Derry and Letterkenny south to Sligo, Galway, Limerick and Cork: and then back up to Dublin via Waterford and Rosslare Europort.     “It would be a game changer for the island’s economy and connectivity, and also a huge asset for Irish tourism.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Devastated in the floods of August , Swan Park, which is a popular destination for walkers from Derry, is currently being restored to its former glory. Local councillor Rena Donaghey said she was happy with the progress. “Regarding the upper section of the Park, Westbrook gate to Nelson’s lane gate, Donegal County Council has appointed a contractor to reconstruct the eye of the bridge and all associated walls around the structure. “Initial works will commence early December. This will involve the removal of debris and plants to prepare the site for major works in January. googletag.cmd.push “The upper part of the park will remain open over Christmas and the holidays to accommodate public access, however this part of the park will then close in early January, as the temporary [Green] bridge, which is in place needs to be removed to repair the main bridge. This contractor will be on site for five months and after that the Council will then complete the paths and landscaping in the upper section of the Park, work which will take a further two months to complete. “In terms of the lower section of the Park, Nelsons gate to Castle Bridge, Donegal County Councils direct labour will be in the lower section of the park repairing paths and drainage, from early December. googletag.cmd.push It is intended to have this section accessible to the public in early January. Cllr Donaghey added that additional landscaping would be required in Swan Park come the drier weather. She said: “However, the public should be able to walk through and enjoy the park. It is great to see the project progressing, given the Covid- pandemic and I feel the Council will be close to the initial deadline for completion.”       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Novena to the Divine Child runs from December  to . In many Carmelite monasteries or convents across Europe and beyond, a tradition grew over the centuries of placing the image of the infant child Jesus that would later be placed in the crib at Christmas in a nun or monks cell for one night. This symbolic act will be echoed in the Termonbacca novena. The image of the infant child Jesus will be carried to nine dferent homes, in nine dferent parts of the Derry area, by an escort of volunteers. googletag.cmd.push It will stay overnight in these homes each day of the novena. This journey recalls the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem to be counted in the census. The novena has traditionally had a strong emphasis on protection from harm and on the family and young people - much needed in the time of Covid- and the social upheaval and disruption, harm, havoc, serious illness and death it has caused. Joy might be in short supply this Christmas time but the Carmelites hope the novena will highlight the real, joyful meaning of Christmas - that Christ has come among us. googletag.cmd.push It presents for us all, as believing Christians, an opportunity to be still and ponder the incarnation and what that event means to us today, they say. It provides time for personal and family prayer and allows us to refocus our attention on the Christ Child, the nature of His coming and, importantly, why He came. The answer to that question is provided in the gospel of John: Yes, God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal le.  The novena itself will comprise of nine evening Masses, celebrated at .pm by the Carmelite Fathers and followed by the public novena prayers.     This will be streamed live from Termonbacca Monastery each evening on its YouTube channel and Facebook page. Prior to the Christmas Eve vigil Mass at pm, the image of the Christ child will be installed in the crib at the Derry retreat centre.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Peter Cunnah who topped the charts with anthems like Things CanOnly Get Better and U R the Best Thing came home to help look after his mum Monica, who sadly passed away last November. He has spent lockdown living by the sea in Fahan where he is working on a new album with his former D:Ream bandmate Al McKenzi. Speaking as a guest on the podcast All Change Please, which is co-hosted by Derry journalist Jeananne Craig, he revealed how he is enjoying the change in pace after nearly  years in the music scene in the English capital. googletag.cmd.push Peter, who grew up in Dove Gardens before moving to Carnhill and then Clarendon Street, said he discovered his love of performing as a teenager in Derry. “We cut our teeth in the sticky carpet in the Gweedore, we put together these gigs and cut our teeth playing live, he said. You learnt how to print the tickets, how to put the posters up, get the word of mouth going, we didn’t have the internet and you learnt from the ground up.” “I got to do a foundation year in Belfast University of Ulster and used the printer to do cassette covers and posters for the band.” googletag.cmd.push From the outset Peter knew what music he was into. “I never wanted to get up and entertain people by strumming my pain and hitting them over the head telling them they’re going to hell in a hand cart, that’s not what music’s ever been to me, he explained. When I got involved in early house music that optimism and hopefulness, I just wanted to encapsulate that, make people happy and make them dance, just as we did when growing up, that element of fun and hope, and D:Ream was a catalyst for me to do that.” The former St Columbs College boy moved to London aged  where launched a highly successful music career as the front man for DReam whose smash hit Things Can Only Get Better became the anthem for New Labour.     Peter says the song still follows him: “I have a thing called the swear box and I make people put a pound in it every time they say, ‘you know what they say Pete, things can only get better!’ Interestingly I was only two weeks into my new house in Donegal when I opened up a euro swear box, and I had  euro from builders, moving agents, they were all at it, he laughed.COMING HOME After the break up of his first marriage Peter met his new we Ruth Pilkington five years ago and they married a year later. The couple decided to move to Fahan last year to help care for Peters mum Monica and dad Leslie. “My kids are old enough now to hop on a plane, he explained. I learnt to swim on Buncrana beach, we had a caravan down here in Buncrana and spent summers chasing rabbits and going swimming, back then Buncrana was like a mini Las Vegas with all these slot machines. I have great memories of that. I’ve been keeping my eye on this spot forever and when the time came to move, we were going to buy a plot and build a house but then this house came up. It’s great because I’m looking out over Lough Swilly, Inch is just across the way from me. This is my forever home, I’m back home where I want to be. I came home to look after my mum and dad, she passed there last November but the idea I could be here and be around for them was just great and my kids could come over. Peter said he has completely overhauled his lestyle since moving to Fahan and has even taken up bird watching. What I didn’t plan on is what this place has given me. I feel connected again, I’ve recharged my batteries, the air is clear, I’ve turned into a bit of a twitcher! We’ve got nesting house martins in the summer, I can see starlings, I know the dference between geese and brent geese - don’t tell anyone, I’m supposed to be a house musician. It’s wonderful, I absolutely love it. For me it’s been a revelation.” “It’s a magical place and as yet undiscovered. And long may it be so!” Peter was speaking to Derry journalist Jeananne Craig on her new Podcast All Change Please.  Jeanne worked in London and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets. But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. All nine episodes are available now and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The landmark Earth nightclub at the junction of Strand Road and Rock Road is to be replaced by  apartments. Seeing the building before torn down will feel like an end of an era for many local people. For years, the Earth complex was at the heart of Derrys nightle. Before being Earth, it was called the Strand Tavern and the complex also housed the Andy Coles bar. In July, Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee granted planning approval for the building to be demolished and replaced by  apartments . googletag.cmd.push  The apartments will be used for social housing and will be, according to the company behind the plans, aimed at over- active elderly persons. Some local residents had objected to the plans because of the lack of parking.

Gerardhad just left and Pete came in and stabilised it all. We had a successful first year and Pete was instrumental in that.“He helped me improve as a professional. When you’re a number two, you’re trying to learn what you can put into your game and over the last two years, especially coming back from England, he was instrumental in everything.”Gartside and Jack Lemoignan are seemingly the future of goalkeeping at Derry City, and despite moving where, Cherrie has promised to always be thereneeded, for both players.“It’s dficult being a goalkeeper because there’s only one position but at the same time as a goalkeeper union, you like to keep a nice tight group,” Gartside explained.“Pete has always said to me thatI ever need anything pick up the phone and give me a call. It happened a few times during the two years, especially being so young and trying to manage things.“We had a healthy relationship and a healthy friendship, and he said to me before he left at the end of the season, that regardless of what happens, his phone is always open and I said the exact same.“It’s been a great two year working with him, he’s a top pro.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A man who epitomized what community meant, Hugh was known to everyone who followed Derry City home and away, and everyone has a story.Following the Candystripes on the road is not just about following the team, it is about creating memories, forging friendships and living le the way it was meant to be lived – surrounded by those who support us, motivate us, and give us a good laugh.Hugh was all of those things, and for those who knew him best, his loss is a sore one.A co-founder of Pride of Northside Supporters’ Club, Hugh could often be found behind the wheel, giving advice, offering opinions or making the passengers roar with laughter. His loss is being keenly felt by those who travelled with him.Pride of Northside emerged from the now defunct Marian Hall Supporter’s Club which had originally formed in  and is now the oldest surviving supporters club.Chairman Michael Kerrigan, a close friend of Hugh, has a letime of memories with a very dear friend.“It’s hard to pick out memories because they are all unique in their own ways,” he said.“There are so many it’s hard to hit on just one. We went to cup finals, we went to Cardf even though we were whacked over there, and there was the - win over Dundalk to win the League Cup on the way to the treble. Those were good times.“I would have known him away back. I would have followed Derry in the fties and sixties. Hugh wouldn’t have been an avid follower in those days and he would be the first to admit it, but he was just so, so engrossed in the fortunes of Derry City. His house was full of regalia, and he was always getting scarves knitted for people.“He was just a one-off. I’ll tell you what, he was just a titan when it comes to Derry City. He would criticize as well, because he was one of these boys who would call a spade a shovel. He fired from the hip at times and he was very witty. He could shout and roar but he didn’t like anyone going over the top with the criticism. He had many contradictions as well, because it was alright for him to criticize, but don’t you be criticizing.”Northside were and remain a close bunch and it wasn’t just Derry City that brought them together, but trips away which in themselves brings a smile to Michael’s face.“The highlights were the holidays,” he said.“We went a lot of places, including West Cork, and we were laughing at the things we got up to, the craft village where they made potchin, and the vintage cars outside. It was great, great craic and he laughed his head off. There are wonderful photos of that. We all enjoyed ourselves when we were away.” has been a grim one for football fans, but as a horrible year comes to an end, the memories of Hugh will remain. Pride of Northside will ensure of that.“He was a very kind and thoughtful person,” Michael added. “He was very good to his we and very good to me the time my own we was sick. He went out of his way to do things for people and particularly with young ones. He loved working with young people and they would have called him their mentor. He was a good educator in that way, giving out advice.“He was so thoughtful and just a kind man. He could be explosive too but his heart was always in the right place. He was always thinking ahead thinking we might need this or we might need that, be it cleaning the bus to have it ready for the next match, or whatever it was. He too it all in his stride, He was just a doer. He always had to be doing things.“If you went up to the cemetery on a Sunday morning, he would be cutting his friends’ grass or his family’s grass. He just did it off his own bat.“He was just an infectious person and everyone wanted to be in his company. I knew him for a long time, but we were particularly close the last  years, particularly working in the Parish Hall with the Parish savings, and in working in the pantomimes. He was so witty as well. He would call the bingo and the abuse he used to give out was fierce. He was a great, great character.“We’re certainly going to miss him. He’ll be a big loss to us. He was just a colossus. He had a great presence about him. He lightened the place up all the time. You would have heard him shouting to you from the end of the street. These are all big memories.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 An amazing.jpg","title":"‘An amazing feeling’  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN star Caitriona Caldwell has said the emptiness of the Kingspan Breffni Park stadium will be one of her abiding memories when she looks back on a weekend when she and her Down camog team-mates were crowned All-Ireland champions.Caldwell was part of a Down defence which helped to keep in check an Antrim attacking line as the Mourne girls clinched the title on Saturday.ldquoWhen the final whistle went and we knew we were champions, just the adrenaline, the buzz and sense of achievement was amazing, recalled Caitriona.ldquoIt was strange, there we were in the stadium in Cavan, a big stadium, but an empty one with this achievement of what we had just done. It was a bit surreal,no doubt.Down went into the game with the pain of a one-point semi-final defeat to Westmeath last term still very much in their minds.That was a heart-breaking reversal for the Mourne girls, but one that they were able to use to fuel their bid for glory this time around.Caitriona said that despite the stadium being bereft of fans the players knew there were so many cheering them on from afar.ldquoThe early goal at the start of the game really helped to settle us down, she said. ldquoIn those stages I was thinking of my mummy and the nerves she would be feeling watching us. But as a team, we needed to get switched on early, get those nervy jitters out of our system quickly, because we knew the challenge that Antrim would pose to us.ldquoEverything went great from early on in the game for us. The communication was good, the flow of the moves worked, and on the day thankfully it all clicked.She also told of how in the days leading up to the final the players spoken about the heartbreak of having come so close in the past. That was something that they knew they could not allow to happen again.ldquoWe did talk about the defeats and the funny thing is, in a way those defeats can actually work to spur you on a bit more, she revealed.ldquoIt played a big part for us psychologically for last weekend, especially for the older players on our . The older you get, you donrsquot know how much more often the chances will come around I suppose. For girls like Catherine McGourty and Fionnuala Carr, they have been there for such a long time, since I was a wee girl really.ldquoThe satisfaction that they must feel, having been there for thatof time, is probably a dferent type of satisfaction to what the younger players must be experiencing now in the wake of what we have done.ldquoAll of this has been a long time coming, but the progress of Down camogie for a while has been brilliant. The numbers participating are going up all the time, there is a great junior structure.ldquoEveryone who was in our team at the weekend, has bettered themselves as players and gone from strength to strength. The bond that has developed with us as team mates has been unbelievable.All of the Down camogie camp are also acutely aware of the wider positive impact their success has had on people within their own communities.

But after that hurt, I suppose the big thing now is relief.The win was the crowning of an unforgettable journey for Down camogs, led by their manager and Laois native Dunne, with Niamh explaining that it has been a year they will never forget.ldquoItrsquos a big win for all of us as iniduals but it was all about doing it for Down, said Niamh, playing down the crucial role she played in scoring two girls to propel her side to the coveted title.ldquoFor the two goals I was in the right place at the right time, she said. ldquoWe worked all week on how we would be able to get on top of Antrim. We knew they were young and a bit inexperienced, but a seriously talented team.ldquoWe knew we could not afford to let them into their stride but, I suppose, in that first half we were guilty of letting them do that a little bit. At half-time, it was about getting in, regrouping and we really drove home the game-plan and swamped the middle third of the pitch.Niamh said she and her team-mates were convinced that once they were able to open up a gap it could prove too much for the fledgling Antrim side to overcome.ldquoThat is what we hoped, she continued. ldquoIn many ways, we have been hurt by our results at this stage in the past, but it also does make you stronger and the experience we gained from the past undoubtedly was a help going into this final.ldquoThat was something we knew we had over Antrim and had to use to our advantage. We knew once we got that little edge on them on the scoreboard, we were on our way to the win.With the title secured, the Down camp can look forward to some well-earned rest and reflection over the Christmas period with Niamh admitting for a iety of reasons that it will be a year that will be impossible to forget.ldquoWithout any doubt it has been a mad year but,you know the Down camogie set-up, yoursquoll know we never do anything by half. Winning in  in a pandemic is just like us. Itrsquos great to get over the line with the win and great to get our hands on the title.

We regrouped then in  and  and changed our approach this year. We didnrsquot look at the bigger picture and took it game by game. Obviously with the restructure after the pandemic you had to adapt and go again and we did and wersquore just delighted.Niamhrsquos scars of battle are very evident with a cut on the nose but the Portaferry sharpshooter is understandably unconcerned. She has spent more time in deeper roles this year, making her harder to pick up when drting inside to often stunning effect.This was evidenced on Saturday with - of her tally of - from play arriving within six minutes of Maeve Kellyrsquos magnicent th minute goal that gave Antrim the lead. That speaks of a big-game player, but Mallon reiterates her managerrsquos assertion that this a truly collective achievement.Modestly, Niamh doesnrsquot mention herself in her checklist of those the team used to lean too heavily upon, acknowledging the privilege of being allowed to congregate and socialise as elite sportspeople in the midst of COVID- when many are confined to their quarters.Niamh added: ldquoDown is no longer reliant on Sara-Louise Carr [Graffin], Fionnuala Carr and Karen McMullan ndash itrsquos an overall effort from  to  with the title win coming straight from the training ground.ldquoItrsquos been massively enjoyable and I have been based from home since the pandemic struck.

Mr Bidenrsquos links with the area are very recent and local.Cllr Brown said Mr Bidenrsquos great, great grandfather Patrick Blewett left Mayo in  to become a sailor in the USA, settling in Scrampton, Pennsylvania, while his great grandfather, James Finnegan, arrived in New York in the late s after travelling from Warrenpoint.He added: ldquoWhile Mr Biden visited Ireland as recently as , there is every reason why Ireland and the UK would be top of his travel list when circumstances allow. Mr Biden has unwavering support for the peace process, given the instrumental role his party played in bringing it together.ldquoWhat better place for the incoming president to visit than our district to trace his ancestral routes in Louth, visit the port his family emigrated from and see the resting place of St Patrick in Downpatrick.SDLP councillor Gary Stokes said the man who will become the th US president ldquoclearlyvalues his Irish heritage and believes thatthe local authority works alongside Louth County Council, there is a better chance of him visiting the Newry, Mourne and Down area.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna suggested that the incoming president had made himself a ldquoisive character with his ill-advised remarks about Orange and Green.He also argued that a man who has spent  years in politics was either badly briefed or totally ignorant of the situation in Northern Ireland, given his remarks which he should apologise for.Cllr Hanna added: ldquoMr Biden should stop looking through his Irish American tinted glasses and see the reality of the situation that there will not be a united Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. I would suggest that he is reminded of this.UUP councillor David Taylor said the motion ldquotook the local authority into US politics which it had never done before, arguing that itrsquo was not a unorm view that everyone welcomed Bidenrsquos victory.ldquoThe incoming president and his vice-president are more than welcome in Northern Ireland at any time. The leader of the free world should be more than welcome to come here which could be beneficial from an investment point of view, he said.ldquoWe acknowledge Mr Bidenrsquos ancestral links to the area and it is not the case that we donrsquot welcome any US president.Sinn Feinrsquos Declan Murphy said that while he understood where his unionist colleagues were coming from, he did not necessarily agree with them.He said he was not supporting the motion for sentimental reasons, explaining it is primarily an opportunity for the island of Ireland to access the White House and to provide more leverage, as it has done in the past, when it comes to dealing with some dficult issues including legacy which politicians here have found it dficult to sort out.Cllr Murphy said he believes that Mr Bidenrsquos election provided ldquogreat opportunities for investment, particularly given the uncertain times ahead as a result of Brexit, adding: We are going to need all the support we can possibly get..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Boost.jpg","title":"Boost for Dunleath development plans  ","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Dunleath Park in Downpatrick as a centre of sporting excellence have taken a step forward.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council committee is to examine the proposal and is being encouraged to establish a project board to take the development further and unlock the facilityrsquos full potential.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, a proposal calling for the revitalisation of the huge sports facility was referred to the councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee for further debate and analysis.Politicians are being asked to establish a development plan that will include cycling and walking trails, the provision of new sensory gardens and upgrading existing sports pitches.The suggested project board mdash comprising council officials and Downpatrick area councillors mdash is expected to focus on all options, including the potential for a new G pitch and so-called bubble facility to allow outdoor tennis to continue in all weathers.Dunleath Park has been at the heart of local sport for many decades catering for soccer, gaelic football and hockey, but little cash has been spent on it, apart from annual maintenance costs.This week, three local politicians have called for the park, which is adjacent to Downpatrickrsquos poundm ultra-modern leisure centre, to be developed as a centre of sporting excellence, insisting that the work is regarded as a priority.Cllrs John Trainor, Gareth Sharvin and Dermot Curran say they recognise Dunleathrsquos potential has been lying untapped for too long, with the trio delighted that the future of the facility has now been formally included on the local authorityrsquos agenda.On Monday night, Cllr Trainor said he was delighted that the proposal for a project board to progress the development of Dunleath Park for sporting excellence, health and wellbeing and recreation was to be discussed by the Active and Healthy Communities Committee.ldquoThis is an essential next step in the development of Dunleath and Gareth, Dermot and I are incredibly proud to lead from the front here. Dunleath Park offers much potential which must be realised, he added.Cllr Sharvin said that given that the council had committed to the proposed development being included on its agenda, it was vital that a project board was appointed to focus on the development and identy key projects for Dunleath.He said local councillors appreciated the potential redevelopment of Dunleath Park has for Downpatrick and the importance of the site for sport in the area, particularly for the Downpatrick Youth Football League and several senior clubs who use the pitches.ldquoThere can be no question that this project board must be led by Downpatrick councillors, insisted Cllr Sharvin.ldquoWe were elected by the people of this area to represent them on council and that is exactly what we have been doing and will continue to do through this board.Cllr Curran cautioned that plans to redevelop Dunleath Park would not happen overnight as there were a number of obstacles that need to overcome.ldquoWe recognise the need for flood assessment for this location but are confident that there are local wins for the community to be had in the short term, he continued.ldquoThere is no reason why we could not develop a walking and cycling path around Dunleath while plans for the larger development continue.

She was a key figure in Downrsquos success.The Portaferry ace claimed two goals and three points from play, and was a key figure in Downrsquos success.Down had too much firepower for Antrim, with Sara-Louise Graffin proving a very influential foil to Mallon. The likes of Sorcha McCartan, Lauren Clarke and Aimee McAleenan were selfless in their toil.Further back, Graffinrsquos sister Fionnuala Carr thundered into the fray in the last ten minutes of the first half.The -year-old marked her  years of representing Down at adult level in stirring fashion alongside fellow co-captain Karen McMullan.Former dual star McMullan was in Australia when Down lost the  final. However, she ed after three years away last term, when the Mourne women fell short by a point at the penultimate hurdle to subsequent victors Westmeath.They would not be denied this time around though, despite the shock of conceding a goal after less than  seconds.It took five minutes for Derek Dunnersquos side to regain their composure, but they were in front by the th minute after Mallon, McAleenan, Paula OrsquoHagan and Graffin all raised white flags.Antrimy hit four of the next five scores to establish a two-point advantage that could have been even greater had Catrine Dobbin not just dragged her ground shot wide with Catherine McGourty coming out quickly to narrow the angle.The Down response was notable. Three points came, including a wonderful effort by McCartan. Then, after Nicole OrsquoNeill pointed a free at the other end, Graffin hit the net with a goal in the third minute of first-half injury time. She showed tremendous strength to make space and finish in trademark fashion after brilliant play out wide by Clarke.That made it - to - at the interval but Paul McKillen got the ideal response from his Antrim team.Dobbin pointed early in the second half before Kelly drilled a fantastic goal home in the th minute.The -year-old took a shoulder from Dearbhla Magee with ease before unleashing a shot that was just too strong for Downrsquos custodian McGourty to repel.Drain denied McAleenan a quick riposte, but it came shortly after as Mallonrsquos piledriver ed her side to the lead. She followed up with a point, as did OrsquoHagan from a free.When Mallon concluded some deft footwork with a resounding finish after Clarke had done tremendously well to win possession, the writing was on the wall for Antrim.They continued to battle, but Down were dominant in too many sectors now.Their know-how shone through as they ensured that there would be no goals conceded, unafraid to relinquish frees to that end. OrsquoNeill converted a few but as time ran out, major scores were required.In the end, it was Clarke who raised the gamersquos final green flag, a fair reward for her tireless efforts.There could be no doubt about the merit of Downrsquos win however.

Our members are very much resolute and are quite prepared to take further days of actionrequired.Last night a council spokesperson said: Talks between Newry, Mourne and Down District Council and the joint trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency are currently ongoing. Therefore, no further comment can be provided at this time.The strike went ahead despite the councilrsquos offer to increase pay scale of refuse workers employed by the former Down District Council to match those employed by the former Newry and Mourne District Council area.However, in a joint trade union side statement, GMB, Unite, NIPSA and SIPTU representatives laid the blame for the ldquoavoidable industrial dispute at the feet of council management.The statement said: ldquoThe trade unions engaged with the council management team in last minute and intense talks mediated by the Labour Relations Agency to seek a resolution to this dispute.ldquoWhile some progress was made in relation to job evaluation, job deions and a timetable for the completion of the negotiations, we failed to secure what was needed in relation to pay equality.ldquoThe point in contention is that for those workers whose pay grades are re-evaluated upwards, they will lose all pay progression accrued and will start at the bottom of the new grades.A statement issued last week by the council refuted that management had failed to engage and said it had met with trade unions, conciliated by the Labour Relations Agency , several times last month.It said that management presented proposals to the trade unions which would mean all refuse collection employees being employed on the same pay grades.It added: ldquoUnder the proposals, refuse workers in the former Down District Council area would increase to pay scales matching those in the former Newry and Mourne District Council area. Acceptance of these proposals could see wages for refuse workers in Downpatrick increasing from December , which has since been ratied.ldquoThe councilrsquos management also agreed to negotiate on additional payments to refuse employees in both Newry and Downpatrick for implementation of new Refuse Operating Procedures and associated practices, which would standardise working practices across the entire district. Pending negotiated agreement, existing practices and associated payments will remain unchanged.The council said that while it regretted that the trade unions were unwilling to call off the strike, it respected the right to take industrial action.The statement ended: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council remains fully committed to resolving this dispute, to ensuring fair pay, transparency and equality for all its employees and to delivering value for money for all rate payers in the Council area, especially at a time when many are experiencing signicant financial hardship.ldquoThe council will continue to work with the LRA and to engage in dialogue with the trade unions to find a workable solution as quickly as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th December 2020 Gateway.jpg","title":"Gateway plans to be submitted  ","story":"A BUSINESS case for a flagship tourism

Newcastle.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of six partners working under the city deal umbrella which are are hoping for a share of a near poundbn investment package.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.In addition, the deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.An outline business case for the Mournes Gateway project is to be formally submitted shortly along with a number of others from across the province.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash expected to come from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.A  which has been appointed to oversee the development of the respective business cases met recently and has revealed that plans for an poundm regional investment are nearing ldquoan important milestone.The  members say the submission of the respective business cases to the UK and Northern Ireland governments in just a few weeksrsquo time represents an important milestone in the city deal journey so far.The UK government plans to invest poundm into the Belfast Region mdash which includes Newry, Mourne and Down mdash with a further co-investment of poundm from city deal partners, including the local authority.Last May, the NI Executive confirmed that it is providing match funding of poundm with the local authority hoping to secure poundm from this funding pot, with plans to add poundm of ratepayers money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre at the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.Council officials are also working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism initiative which includes an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy.Other aspects of the tourism scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes and the development of a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said the city deal was ldquocritical to the future recovery of the region.She continued: ldquoImportance has been placed on ensuring the progression of those projects that will stimulate transformative investment right across the city deal region, with the submission of the business cases taking us one step closer to the delivery phase and investment starting to flow into our region.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council has worked towards the completion of outline business cases on the Mournes Gateway and Newry city centre regeneration scheme as part of this progress. ldquoAlongside these projects is the progression of Newryrsquos southern relief road, a high quality, digitally enabled innovation space and a robust employability and skills programme that will ensure we have the people and skills to drive future growth and

two rights of way serving the general Malone Heights area, connecting Church Street with Malone Park and Malone Court and saving residents timewalking into the town centre by cutting out New Bridge

explained that he has been attempting to persuade either the local authority or government department to clear up Breenrsquos Lane and maintain it.ldquoThis particular area is currently blocked as the result of some fly-tipping of mostly green waste from an abandoned site further up the path. I donrsquot believe that it was never adopted as it was cleaned in the past, but is now covered in moss and green debris which says to me that it has not been cleaned in over a year, suggested Cllr Enright.The Downpatrick councillor said that Harryrsquos Loney, which links the Strangford Road with Malone Heights and the Saul Road, has been adopted, describing it as a ldquovery useful short cut, especially for students who attend St Patrickrsquos Grammar School.Cllr Enright said the laneway was adopted last year after he spent many months trying to persuade Northern Ireland Water to maintain the sewer that runs through it which overflowed every time there was heavy rain.He added: ldquoThese laneways, or loneys as they are commonly described as, are not only an essential resource for local people, but are part of our sustainable future.ldquoToo many of them have been allowed to wane or be lost over the past  years as people adapted to taking even short trips by car.

the former St Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School site in the town with the proposal including a new pound, base for the Mourne Mountain Rescue Team.Lidl plans to demolish the former school building to pave the way for the new store and rescue centre and parking for  vehicles, with planners insisting that no development activity or demolition work, ground preparation or vegetation clearance can take place until a final construction and environmental management plan has been submitted and approved by the Planning Authority.Plans to redevelop the former primary school site mdash which is expected to create up to  new jobs mdash were originally submitted in January  to replace Lidlrsquos existing base at Railway Street in the resort.Last November, it was announced that planning permission for the multi-million pound store was to be quashed following a judicial review by objectors.It was confirmed at the time that permission was quashed as the result of a procedural error in relation to the papers before the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with Lidl consistently arguing that its current base is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.Lidl said the Railway Street premises were only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found, with Lidl insisting that it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available.A number of objections were lodged with planners about the proposal, including that the development was not in keeping with the residential nature of the area and that the closure of the retailerrsquos existing store would have a detrimental impact on Newcastle town centre and surrounding inconvenience stores.Concern was also expressed about the proposed storersquos impact on traffic, the potential for increased flooding and the impact of selling alcohol, particularly to young children, with objectorsarguing that

She has been cancer free now for around a year, the -year old revealed.ldquoSeeing her, and what she has come through, has encouraged me though to keep going with things. My wonderful mum is an inspiration to me and all of our family. She has fought the disease, and had a lot of treatment and has just done so, so well.Four years ago, at the Rio Paralympics, Bethany made her mark on the world stage. A series of superb displays saw her take home three gold medals and one silver. She would become Team GBrsquos most decorated athlete of the Games.In , whilst competing for Ireland in her first Paralympics, Bethany won a gold medal at the Games in London in the S  metres backstroke final. At that stage, Bethany had been swimming for only three years. She went on to win three silver medals at the  IPC Swimming World Championships.It remains to be seen whether Bethanyrsquos family will be able to go to Tokyo next year to cheer her on, just as they did in Brazil.ldquoI would love my family to be there, Bethany admitted. ldquoI remember each time before I swam in Rio, they would tell me where they were seated and I would look across and could see them. It was like that important piece of comfort because I was so far away from home.ldquoWhen you see them, it is such a great support. My family are so good. At the moment, we donrsquot knowany spectators will be at the events. Right now, we are just hoping that the Games will go ahead.ldquoIf they take place without spectators it will be hard, but at least we will be able to compete. I was in Japan in January and got to sample what the country is like out there.

Japan is an amazing country with an amazing culture and I would want to be there to represent myself and my country.Should Bethany claim more medals, it would only cement her already-assured status as one of the great Paralympians.Having to wait the extra year for the Games, due to the spread of coronavirus has, however, brought its own dficulties.ldquoWhen I heard earlier this year, that the Games had been called off, it was very hard to take because it is something that you are working towards for four years, she said.ldquoWe do other competitions of course in between though they are never as big as the Paralympics.ldquoHowever to be told they were postponed was really challenging.You have to look at the positives though.ldquoIt has given me an extra year to train and to prepare. Training was probably the hardest thing.ldquoObviously, the pools closed at the start of lockdown, so it meant Ibasically had to go out into a paddling pool in my back garden and I was on a bungee chord to get a feel for the water.ldquoSport NI and the Sports Institute Northern Ireland made up a good programme of daily things to do, so I was on the bike and running. Irsquom definitely more of a pool girl, but I canrsquot run to save my le, she joked.ldquoIt was nearly the end of the first lockdown when we were allowed to train and I had to travel to Dublin three times a week.ldquoI am now training in Ards because, thankfully, elite athletes have been allowed to train here, which is a big positive.Asthose challenges were not enough, Bethany has also been on the road to recovery from injury.ldquoI had a shoulder problem, and had to go and get that injected, so that put me out of the water for a bit a few weeks ago. But I am back in now and building the work back up.ldquoMy team and I have also looked at other areas of sport science to try and help me improve, such as tracking my sleep and making sure I am always recovered between sessions.ldquoThe British trials will be held in April and that is the main event I am focusing on at the moment.

Deaf children are still twice as likely not to get five good GCSEsMeanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir launched a consultation on a new way of delivering services for disabled children and the Stormont assembly debated the education support deaf children are receiving and how it’s been affected by the pandemic.This may sound like talk without action, but it presents a golden opportunity for real change and reform to our system for supporting children with special educational needs and disabilitiesThe findings from the audit office report were no surprise for the families we support at the National Deaf Children’s Society. Parents are routinely trapped in a bureaucratic nightmare, waiting months for confirmation of what support their child is entitled to.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...\"Alasdair OHara, head of Policy and Influencing in Scotland and Northern Ireland for the National Deaf Childrens SocietyIt is appalling that in almost nine out of ten cases, the already y  week time limit to put support in place is missed. Agreement on what will be provided often only comes once appeals processes begin. This can be exhausting and upsetting for parents, children and for teachers.Meanwhile, frontline teachers of the deaf, who play a massive role in a deaf child’s le, have fallen by almost a third across Northern Ireland since .Put simply, we’re spending larger sums on SEN support and it still isn’t always reaching the children that need it. If we want to remove unnecessary costs, let’s make sure assessments are done accurately in the first place, and reduce the time, money and energy wasted on unnecessary appeals.Good support provided in the right way is vital because when deaf children receive it in the early years and at school, there’s no reason why they can’t achieve the same as every other child. Despite recent improvement and the best efforts of education professionals, deaf children are still twice as likely not to get five good GCSEs including English and Maths. In the face of these huge challenges, there are two key factors that can make a dference. Firstly, we need leadership from the top. Seeing assembly members discuss the key issues affecting deaf children is crucial, but we need action to address the gap in achievement between deaf and hearing children, particularly as so many have fallen even further behind during the pandemic. Most importantly, we must address the problem before it begins and this is where the education minister’s announcement progressing our new SEN system will be critical.Our first task must be making sure we have the right system in place for the assessment and identication of a deaf child’s needs at the very beginning. Without having to challenge schools or the Education Authority, families must be told who will be supporting their child, for how long and how this will improve their lives.With , deaf children in Northern Ireland, parents and teachers really do need access to specialist support and the right technology, especially as many often have limited or no prior knowledge of childhood deafness. But leadership from the top isn’t enough – the second priority must be accountability. It’s abundantly clear that we need to establish a stronger accountability system for SEN services, one which challenges them to improve and provides both families and policy makers with the information they need. How can we knowsupport is effective and efficientwe do not have robust monitoring, evaluation and inspections With better leadership and an accountable support system that really delivers, change is possible. This is particularly relevant for the current generation of deaf young people, who amid the pandemic will leave school to enter a very dferent labour market. Deaf young people can work anywhere and have the same dreams as hearing people, but to realise their potential, they need support before starting school, when they’re at school and as they leave it. For a rarer disability like childhood deafness, receiving tailored transition support is incredibly important and this requires input from specialist staff. Their progress will show us whether the changes being made are getting through.In all of this, we also need to remember that each child is dferent and in many cases, needs change as children grow older. Implementing these improvements can help us build a dedicated support system that responds to and provides for the needs of the children who rely on it.Deaf children could finally get the support they need to close the attainment gap between them and their hearing classmates and to live the lives they have always aimed for. Every child deserves the same chance in le, and deaf children are no exception.• Alasdair O’Hara is head of policy at the National Deaf Children’s Society • Treat people with a learning disability as equal citizens• Ben Lowry: Response to my tweet on special needs shows how Northern Ireland could become ungovernable——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

When it comes to learning disability, however, the pace of change has been glacial. It’s time we, as a society, took a dferent approach.We live in a world where it’s deemed acceptable by government departments to pay consultants £, a day, but unacceptable to spend money on, for example, children with additional educational needs, as we saw with the recent outcry over allocation of funding in this area. The former is seen as a necessity, the latter as a drain on public finances.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That is why we need to change the terms of the debate. Children and adults with a learning disability and their families are sick of being regarded as a burden. Society doesn’t see them as iniduals, but as one homogenous group. We do things for them or to them, without bothering to ask what they would like to do themselves. In many parts of health and social care, they are referred to as “service users,” which itself implies that they are people who don’t contribute, but rather make demands for assistance. That’s why we established Positive Futures. We work hard to ensure that people have a voice and a say in how they are supported — and in how the organisation is managed and governed. We have an Advisory Board, which made up of people with a learning disability, including some of the people we support, which contributes to operational and strategic decision-making. We facilitate people to have the power to make decisions about their own lives. All parts of society need to do the same. And here’s the essence of what we have discovered over the course of  years:you regard children with a learning disability and their families as equally worthy of investment rather than as a drain on resources, supporting them will cost less in the long term. I would argue that the failure of the system begins in childhood. If support begins early enough, it prevents more expensive interventions and support in later le. This is where we need to focus our discussion about cost. If you have read this far, I’d like to ask you a question. How would you like to be regarded as a burden all your le  That’s often what people with a learning disability tell us it feels like. Far too often, we fail to see the contribution people with a learning disability can make to our society and instead, for reasons often described as ‘ in the person’s best interests,’ we adopt a protective, paternalistic approach which denies people the opportunity to make choices, have control over their lives and contribute to a richer, more inclusive community.So let’s change the terms of the debate. Treat people with a learning disability as equal citizens and regard the money society spends on them as an investment for the future, rather than as a financial burden. That’s what we at Positive Futures have been doing for the past  years.

These centres have already been decided by health boards and are in the process of being prepared.The development process for coronavirus vaccines has been as stringent as any other but the process in the face of the pandemic has been sped up by prompt, world-wide funding and a reduction in paperwork.Theof the trials have not been shortened, and the usual safety measures remain in place.The vaccine will not be mandatory and people will be able to choose whether they take up the vaccine or not.Information will be provided to people before vaccination to reassure them about patient safety and robust consent processes will be in place.Vice-chairman of the Covid- Vaccine Programme Board, Richard Roberts from Public Health Wales, said: ldquoIt is a signicant achievement that only  months after WHOannounced the global pandemic that we now have the first safe and effective vaccine available for use in Wales, and other vaccines to follow.\"Everyone has been preparing for months to deliver the Covid- vaccine programme, and it is very exciting that we will be able to begin, once the final steps have been put in place so that the programme can be delivered safely. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Shops, hairdressers, restaurants, places of worship and hotels are among the places that will be able to re-open from December . Pubs selling drink onlywill remain closed and an additional financial package will be put in place. The Executive has also agreed Christmas household bubbling arrangements from December -. Three households will be able to come together for this period in domestic settings, outdoor public spaces and places of worship. One of the households will be able to include their existing household bubble. First Minister Arlene Foster said: “Through our collective efforts over recent weeks we gained enough space in the transmission of the virus to relax a signicant number of restrictions, including the opening-up of non-essential retail, close contact services, sport and leisure activities and our places of worship at the end of next week. “These decisions will give families, businesses and employees some much-needed certainty and comfort in the run-up to Christmas and beyond. “This is a special time of the year and we want to support people to have a good Christmas, but also a safe one. “Signicant work has been completed with business sectors, faith groups, local government and police on new mitigation measures to reduce the risk of transmission. “I urge everyone to be Covid-aware and to make careful and sensible decisions when out and about or mixing with others. We need to make sure we continue doing all we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones.” Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “The Executive wants to give people as much notice as possible on what the situation will look like from next Friday when the current circuit breaker comes to an end. “We have given detailed consideration to which restrictions need tobe maintained, and what we can open up, in light of the scientic and medical advice. “A package of measures that will see signicant relaxations to the current restrictions has been agreed, with maximum mitigations in place to minimise risks to the greatest extent possible. An additional support package will be put in place for traditional drink-only pubs that unfortunately will not be able to reopen at this time. “We appreciate how important Christmas time is for many families and the Executive has agreed arrangements that will allow families and friends to come together in a limited way between  and  December. “It’s important for people to understand that with any increased contact comes increased risk. Everyone needs to think very carefully about the risks posed to them, and their loved ones, by coming together over the Christmas period, particularly to those who are vulnerable. Some may choose not to form a Christmas bubble but for those who do, we encourage them to keep their bubbles small and limit the numbers of people gathering, as much as possible.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbbcbeaeebcbfe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eeeaacb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
